**Admitted students:** First of all, congratulations on all your hard work! Now you get to have the happiest of worries on which great institution to call your alma mater :) Post all your questions and comments here. This includes questions about undergrad and grad school admissions alike. We hope to welcome you to the Yale community but also feel free to ask us why it might not necessarily be the best choice for you. Individual posts outside of this megathread are subject to removal.

**Students and alumni**: Let's try our best to give constructive, specific feedback to all prospective Yalies and refrain from comments that would discourage them in any way.Hey r/Yale! I was just wondering if anyone here was majoring in/majored in the Computer Science and Economics major at Yale (or know anyone who is majoring in it), what your thoughts were on the major as a whole, how hard was it, and how many people typically take it? Thanks!Specifically field hockey. Also if anyone has any experience playing a club sport I’d love to know your thoughts on how competitive club sports are and the time commitment needed, thanks!I know they recommend 4.5, but how many people do more? For anyone who did more, was it too much to handle?&#x200B;

Not looking for an easy pass, but was wondering if there are any less intimidating classes for non-STEM studentHi everyone,

I just finished bachelor's degrees in Comp Sci and Statistics from a T5-T10 public university in 3 yrs. 

I have the opportunity to complete an MS in Comp Sci at Yale, fully funded with a 24K annual stipend for 2 yrs.

I think I like ML, but am not heartset on it. Most people at Amazon are telling me just to stay and go full time since a master's in CS supposedly adds little value especially since I have work authorization, but I would like to hear what you guys
think of:

- The quality of upper division CS classes
- The value of Yale on a CS resume
- The ability of grad students to mingle with undergrads/socialize

Feel free to share anything else! Non-CS people are surprised I am considering this and many think I am potentially turning down this exciting opportunity.

Thanks in advance!i'm an incoming sophomore transfer (but i took a gap year so i'm currently 20) thinking about the mid-orientation programs. i know that FOCUS has a transfer-specific program, but do the other programs put transfers in groups with only first years? i'm interested in FOOT but idk how i feel about being 20 in a group with 18-year-olds trying to make friends with other 18-year-olds (especially bc the social aspect is supposed to be a big draw). has anyone done foot and had a transfer student in their group?Please let me know have a week to get it sorted Thankss!Hey all!

I'm an incoming MPH student at Yale School of Public Health and, as an international student, I'm not too familiar with the New Haven area. I was wondering if there are any neighbourhoods in New Haven that are considered to be "unsafe" or that we should generally avoid? Thanks so much!I’m a prospective student, who will be going to Yale in the coming fall, I found a Yale website saying how Yale offers Adobe Creative Cloud for free for students but it’s a few years old. Do they still offer this? When I try it says “access denied please contact admin”, is it possibly because I’m a prospective student?Has anyone done ONEXYS before? Would you recommend it?Hi! I've just found out that you can't apply for a Yale undergraduate degree if you already hold a undergrad degree from a different uni. I'm currently doing an undergrad in Australia and been wanting to apply to Yale for a different degree once I've finished this one. 

I'm just wondering what the reason is for this? 

Thanks :))Hi everyone! Prospective Masters student, just reaching out to enquire about how the application and admissions process went for
 current Yale E&RS students. 

Also, how robust is the financial aid for E&RS applicants?

I’m really interested in Yale for graduate school, I think I have a really good chance of getting in, but the most important factor to my decision is financial aid. 

Looking forward to responses!Any opportunities for undergraduates interested in boxing?

Not necessarily a ring, just punching bags at least.Hi!

I was wondering - are there any male/co-ed recreational gymnastics options at Yale? It's one of my favorite activities and want to keep at it when coming next yearElon Musk recently tweeted that Yale is ["the epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization".](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526975113597489154?s=21&t=KrZZY9r8k_qHVh1ybeoRqw) As Yale students, how true is this? I don't mind the downvotes this post will get.Hi, incoming YSM grad student here. What are the cheapest ways to find housing in and around Yale, that are not in dangerous areas? 
I do not mind many roommates, small rooms, religious organizations, sharing apartment with elderly, whatever it takes. We get a small stipend, but with health insurance for international students and moving, we don't have that much money left. 
Any advice appreciated.i’m thinking of doing the day trips and have no idea if i’m fit enough to do a foot trip. how far is the journey each day for the day trip?I want to get involved in Greek life on campus possibly. My brother was in Sig Ep at FSU so he's been trying to help me research but it's been pretty difficult finding information about how to rush and fraternities at Yale. I was interested in Alpha Delta Phi or Sigma Chi possibly? But honestly, any frat would be great I think. Any and all info would be appreciated :)This has probably been asked like 1000 times but I'm a rising junior who hasn't completed their language requirement and really just need something easy. I've heard good things about Portuguese and Indonesian so far, can anybody who has taken either of these share their experience (L1-L3).Would appreciate it if anyone who knows of the program could list the pros and consI come from a small school without a football team, so I might be naive when it comes to the difficulty of being selected for a football team, but is it possible to walk-on for Yale Football without previous experience? I played Varsity level D1 sports in high school, specifically basketball, and I am 6’6” 290 lbs and lift. I obviously wouldn’t start or anything, but I’d like the community and staying fit. I’m attending this fall. Thanks.

By the way, any other suggestions for possible varsity or club level teams would be appreciated, with my past experience in mind. Was talking to my brother at Yale the other day and he told me that a lot of celeb kids go there. Is it really true that children/relatives of A-list celebrities/TV personalities etc are currently at Ivies/T10s but current students are supposed to be lowkey about them?people who’ve been in fys, i was wondering would i have enough time to go visit home on weekends? i’m a two hour drive away, but i’m not sure how busy they’d be keeping fys students.trying to decide if it is worth the 7 weeksHey guys,

I was just wondering if anyone knew of any volunteering options in New Haven? I feel like I hear of them through the grapevine but have no idea how to actual get started with joining/membership. Does anyone know more about some options?It seems there many e-scooters being used around campus, especially up by science hill.   What do people do with them when they have to be inside a campus building (classroom, library, etc.)?  Do people carry scooters inside and keep them with them?  or do they lock them up at an exposed bike rack?  or do something like lock it up on a bike rack inside the gates of a nearby residential college?  Are there are any restrictions bringing them inside if you want to?Is Portuguese still relatively an easy language class? The course table reviews are still really great, but sometimes I know that those can be a little outdated lol. Has anyone taken it recently that can comment on it?i’m an incoming int’l so i’m not too sure what brands are common (both for normal outfits and for winterwear)Close and cheap grocery shop recommendations near OC (aka not GHeav)title. Has anyone done the program before? It seems great but I feel like it’s a lot of added stress for what was supposed to be a super stress-free summer.. any thoughts? Did anyone like/dislike? Thanks :)!Hi:)

I’m an illustration major student from RISD (bfa) and I wish I could go to yale for mfa (either painting or gd). But wondering which school did yale students get ba or bfa before yale?i’ve heard that FOOT is the best but i’m super unfit lol so i’m considering the base camp trips — are those good/ a waste of time? my main priority is coming out of orientation w a group of friends, so any advice is appreciated!Class of 26 and was wondering if Yale will rescind for 1s and 2s on ap tests?Hello everyone! I'm a non-traditional student and finished my high-school in 2016 but didn't go to college because i was fighting a mental illness. 
I'm currently in medschool( here in Brazil you get  in directly and the course takes 6 years to complete) and just finish my first semester with 4.7 GPA( that puts me in top 1 of my class) and i also do voluntary work helping people that are fighting a similar problem than I did.
My question is: does my profile fits the one that Eli Whitney Program is looking for?
I understand that the admission is complex and need more information than the ones I gave, but, maybe, you  folks can give me some insight or any advice about this subject. 
Ps: I didn't find the admission megathread, only the admitted one. Unfortunately that's not my case yet. If that's the wrong place do put my question, please show me the right one and I will delete the post.I was wondering if anyone has done this program… it’s a 18 month rotational program & I was looking for more information from ppl who have completed the program // ppl who know of it. I tried to look online but couldn’t find any reviews. I’m just curious as to how other’s felt this program was to them // if the program made an impact to their CS career. 

<currently studying my masters in cs>Disclaimer I go to school in Miami and couldn’t figure out if Leo was a fratHello I’m looking for a Silliman plate from before they went to the common plate. Here is a picture of one https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/170094. I know they sold them here http://www.yale.edu/dining/options/yale_plates_order.html. However they no longer sell them there. So I’m hoping there is another place I can get one. If you know where to look it would be much appreciated. Thanks!TitleMoving to New Haven for residency training at the end of June/early July. Never lived outside of Florida. Any recommendations on how to find off campus housing in New Haven?hi! im a dutch high school student planning to apply to yale next fall, but since i cant visit the campus and ask a few questions that i have i thought id ask them here :) some can probably only be answered by other international students but ill just list them all:

- can i get 7 hours of sleep every night and still stay on top of my schoolwork, extracurriculars and possibly a job? im probably gonna major in english or wgss and im planning to apply to the education studies program :)
- is it smart for an international student to apply early action? because yale is my absolute dream school and id like to have my college applications out of the way before i start preparing for my final exams (im also applying early action to a dutch university) but i heard universities often defer international students anyway because they want to be able to compare everyone in the pool
- if i use they/them pronouns, will that be respected? and generally how accepting are yale students & faculty towards queer students?
- what types of activities would i do during the international students pre-orientation thingy & would i already be able to live in my suite?
- are the astronomy courses that prerequire "knowledge of elementary algebra" hard? im definitely not a stem person anymore but i had an astronomy obsession when i was 12 so i thought id fulfill the science requirements that way, but because of the dutch high school system i wont have had any physics classes for the last three years when i go to yale (i will have the said knowledge of elementary algebra though)
- this question needs to be asked so that i have a counter argument to tell my mum: do yale students fly a lot? (as in by airplane) because my mum thinks ill be surrounded by people who fly like 8 times a year and dont really think about the environmental consequences of flying (which i do, a lot) while i think most yale students would be smart enough to not fly that much anyway that is sort of a discussion weve been having
- this last question may require a bit more explanation lmao but here we go: in 2019 i went to the west coast of the usa and one thing that really bothered me was how much sugar americans put in pretty much everything (bread, tomato sauce, you name it, there was sugar in it). now my question is, is this also the case in yales dining halls? because ive seen those "what i eat in a day" videos on youtube but obviously when someone says "i had pasta" i cant really know whether the pasta was sugary or not lmao (i guess my questions is just "what do international students think of the food in yales dining halls")What's up guys. I'm a student at Emory coming to Yale this summer for some chemistry research. I don't really know much about Yale/New Haven but I'm hoping to meet some cool people and make some good friends this summer.

I'm 20M, studying Applied Math/Stats. I'm into math, guitar, olympic weightlifting (also curious about what gyms are nearby), filming/edits, drifting, history, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm decently outgoing and would be curious to find parties/etc. in New Haven too.

If you're here over the summer and we share any interests (or even none at all) definitely shoot me a PM! 

Also my program said I'll be staying in Yale housing but haven't given specifics yet so if anyone has any perspective on what that's like it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!AP Research: 93

I cannot raise these grades whatsoever... This is what I will have after I do all the extra credit possible. I'm a prospective neuro major admitted RD and I have had 2 Bs in the past in calculus. I also have a valid reason if they were to demand a letter explaining the 2 Cs. Will I get rescinded?Man that was terrible. I stuttered so bad and said UM way too much! One of the questions i didn’t really know how to respond to until after the recording was done and i feel like they should’ve gave us a chance to redo it. Not a great option for those with anxiety.Not a student, will probably never step foot on a Ivy League Campus, but I wonder how people at a Ivy League school feel about one of their own getting drafted[Yale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpuy4BEU644&ab_channel=KenCarson) by Ken Carson
