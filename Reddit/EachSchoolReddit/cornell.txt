Would appreciate any feedback, thank you so much :)Yes! Upload them :) Anything that will give you an edge to your app and your gut tells you to do it, do itI would not. An admissions officer doesn't want to read your academic paper.Ok yea the school responded and said they do thx.For supplemental materials, does Cornell accept uploading research abstracts/excerpts from research papers?Idk man, you got a shot, so take itHola friends 👋.

What are my chances looking like for Cornell? I want to major in mathematics 🧮

Thanks for your time and **have a great day!** 🙌🙌🙌Wdym yesterday? The decisions don't come out till 31st March, right? I'm so confusedSince I don't know if anyone answered this for you I'd say that more than a couple Cs or a D/F is probably when you'd encounter a problem. However, be aware that the university will contact you first to ask what caused your grades to drop like that, so you might be able to make a case for yourself regardless of what your grades look like by the end of the academic yearCongrats! Did you get in as First-year or transfer student?BRO I ALSO GOT EARLY ADMISSION TO SHA! SEE YOU THERE!!Early acceptance letter into SHAFirst year! Senior in HS rn. Thanks!!!Congrats!Just got in yesterday. Never thought I’d make it this far and let my grades slip second semester. How low can I go before getting rescinded?they are identical programs. if you are NYS resident it is most strategic to apply to CALS for less competitive admission and lower tuition.Cornell admits by school, not by major. If you are a NY resident and apply to a statutory college (CALS, HumEc, ILR), you will have a better chance of admission.

Biometry is within CALS and Stats is within CAS, so if you do not have a preference of curriculum, you will theoretically have a higher chance if you apply CALS. Not to mention you will also get in-state tuition.thank you! That's what I thought but should I have some bio/ag-related extracurricularar to relate to the college (which I don't)?In the Why essay for CALS, should I focus on Stats or should I also mention biology/medicine-related experience or thoughts?nope but definitely catered towards the CALS mission statement. I think I personally wrote abt my then-interest in medicine and math but I lowkey knew I wanted to do ds/finance lolNo clue. Write about your own interests. Don't make up stuff that you aren't truly passionate about.How do you do ds/finance in CALS? Do you double major or minor with Dyson?Can anyone compare the Biometry Statistics major and Statistical Science majors? For NY residents, which has easier admission? No particular bio-related experience but good statistical-related EC. Thank you!Some things of note:

1) Cornell only considers legacy status during early admissions.

2) Cornell does not give credit for APUSH.
https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?catoid=45&navoid=18035Yeah, I knew that about the legacy, and that’s a shame about APUSH, but at least they’ll still see I did well on the exam. Thanks!Hi! I have a 1560 SAT, a 5 on APUSH (have taken/taking 4/6 available APs), and am a National Merit Semifinalist. My ECs are very focused in politics, but no national competitions or research. I applied to CALS for Biometry and Statistics. My personal statement was pretty solid and everyone I showed it to loved it. My supplemental essay was good, but nothing outstanding. I’m a legacy, but applied RD. What are my chances?CALS is test blind so you don't need to worry about studying for the PSAT/SATuh oh my cool format didn’t work out but I hope this makes sense LMAOThank you! I’m glad to know that they’re test blind in this scenario. My school requires a certain passing score for the ACT/SAT so I’m working towards that though unfortunately 💔Can someone Chance Me? 💕

Currently running three AP classes (Chem, Psych, Lang), and two more my senior year (Gov, Lit)

Honors have no real affect on my rate of passing but my school has an implemented veterinary program designed for college, (you enter much like entering for a major in college!) and provide a College and Career Ready diploma upon graduating

PSAT score was a 1130, but that was without studying at all lol, definitely projecting for a higher scoreI don’t know much about double majoring, but I also got into CS at GT last year and at an info session, they made it sound like it’s difficult to take many classes outside your major due to a pretty rigid curriculum. That was a huge turn off for me and considering that you’re thinking of double majoring, it might be for you as well. Definitely go to an info session at both schools if you’re able to!CS is definitely hard at GT but it’s not impossible. I would personally recommend Tech even as a current Cornell student because it’s kind of easier tbh than double majoring at Cornell.
Source: CALS transfer from TechHello, I’m a prospective CALS student (‘26): Does double majoring in biometry & statistics AND information science sound manageable? I’m choosing between CS at Georgia Tech and CALS at Cornell. Thank you :)My 2nd choices were either Colorado State or UC Davis. I chose Cornell because it is the top in Animal Science and they offered good financial aid. I honestly didn't know that much about it before coming here and I wasn't certain about my choice up until the moment I accepted my spot here.What was your "2nd choice" uni?

...and why did you end up choosing Cornell instead of them?Being a current student helps out[deleted]I transferred here and I recall being able to submit only one letter of recommendation, so determine who you think wrote the best one. Also, it should be one of the three your professors wrote.

GPA is fine. It's not going to detract from your application.

In my opinion, the most important part of the transfer application is the "why do you want to transfer to Cornell?" essay. This profile you've posted here doesn't mean much. If you don't have legitimate reasons to apply to Cornell specifically you'll get rejected no matter what your stats look like at any of Cornell's colleges.  With that said, I think you can make a good case for wanting to come to Cornell for its many research opportunities, given your prior experience.JUNIOR TRANSFER:

-3.89 GPA


-started music club, work as a tutor, 300 hours of biochemistry research, interning in chemistry lab for fortune 500 company


-4 good letters from professors and supervisorIt means they are looking for you have taken four years of high school mathematics, with at least one of those years including some form of calculus. If your school did not offer calculus, admissions will be understanding. If you chose not to take calculus, your application will definitely not be favorable (unless there are extenuating circumstances).I was informed by an advisor that pre-calculus does not count. However, your application will likely not be automatically rejected. Some courses are offered over the summer. I would look into that. It is possible that, if accepted, you could complete this before the fall semester.I’m a bit confused. On the website ( https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/admissions/ ) it says 4 units of mathematics including calculus are required from applicants. Does pre-calculus count? If not, will my application be automatically rejected since I haven’t taken calculus?Decent chance, where r u transferring from? Also with a cool story like that I’d say it helps you out even moreI'm transferring from a small community college in rural Virginia. Surprised so many credits would transfer over. Nobody in my family holds a college degree. Will these factors hurt my chances? I hear legacy students have the highest chance of admission..Not really. Legacy helps but it’s not huge. I would really explore your passions In your essay, I’d be happy to read it over if it helps but I’m just a freshmen in ILR

Tbh idk how many older students they take but I wouldn’t worry about legacy too much. Plenty of non legacy students get admitted, especially to ilr. 

Good luck!Hi, all!
ILR transfer prospect here. I have 26 credits and will be taking 6 credits in the spring and was assured by Ian that all but one class would transfer. I have a 3.85 GPA while working full time in a warehouse. Ample experience in this environment. Really where my heart lies, and I'd like to do more. ILR is the perfect fit. What are my chances? I'm nearly 30 years old and did poorly in high school because I simply did not care to apply myself. Poor home life growing up and was severely depressed, but I've since turned a new leaf. Passionate about blue collar labor and have a desire to learn how to positively impact the field I've come to love.Materials can be submitted late, as long as they are received by January 10th.

https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/I think you should be fine, colleges usually give teachers some leeway with the deadlines. I had a similar issue with another college and still got in.This isnt really a chance me but more of a: am i screwed on a technicality? question. 

I submitted my commonapp earlier today with everything good,  except for the fact one out of two teachers did not ever submit their letter of recommendation. Cornell's website seems pretty strict on the issue. Is there anyway i can get an extension to get this letter of recommendation?


For the record i asked this teacher for my letter of rec in may, and followed up in September and november.

Edit: she submitted it today so happily ill be able to apply. Love your school btwTo the best of my knowledge, you can minor in any available minor, no matter the school you are in and it is in. I have no idea if a dance minor exists, but you can google it.Yes I am doing this exact thing, totally possibleSO COOL OF YOU :OCan i minor in dance but major in physics(?)It's a bit easier to get into CALS instate compared to oos. Being an international still puts you at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to domestic students even if you don't need financial aid. However, it mostly depends on where you go to school.Thank you for the reply! I was worried because some people say I need to halve the general acceptance rate to get the acceptance rate for international student. Would it be that hard for international students not requiring financial aid or will it be slightly less if I don't ask for the financial aid?I'm not sure about exact numbers but I know it would definitely be easier. About 10% of Cornell is international but only ~40 internationals are accepted with aid every year, so the large majority are not on aid.Thank you so much for the help!Is it harder to get into Cornell CALS info sci major as an international student who does not require a financial aid compared to instate or oos applicant?Hi, former TO here!

It is mainly for new activities but you can also put any significant activities you did since you last submitted your application to CornellThank You for your response! I am happy to see you again here. How are you liking Cornell?Pretty good, the weather is crazy tho 😅CORNELL TO question 

Hi! I just received my TO application for CALS. I am concerned because it says that we have to fill in new activities and employment. Are all of you putting new activities only or are you also using some of your high school ones?I read something about roughly 20% of transfer students were from CC in recent years. Looks like they don't put much weight into where transfers come from, so long as they fit in with the culture. I'm a fellow transfer applicant! Good luck :)How does Cornell rate transfer students from community colleges ?I transferred to Cornell last Fall, and when I was working on the personal statement, I wrote about my potential educational and career paths beyond my time as an undergrad. I was partially interested in coming to Cornell to pursue academic research, so I wrote a bit about how that could lead to me attending grad school, to give you an example. To rephrase the personal statement the way I think it's meant to be interpreted: what do you want to do with your life after graduation?

The main essay was where I listed all my general reasons for wanting to attend, based primarily on the academic interests I had developed and the limitations of the school I previously attended.How should I approach the personal statement essay for Cornell as a CC transfer? To be exact, I'm referring to this question:  
The personal statement helps colleges get to know you better as a person and a student. Please provide a 1,250-3,250 character statement discussing your educational path (approx. 250 - 650 words). How does continuing your education at a new institution help you achieve your future goals?  
Is this question meant to be pretty open-ended like a first-year app? I'm just not sure how to distinguish it from the other Cornell Essay Question:  
Tell us what you'd like to major in at Cornell, why or how your past academic or work >experience influenced your decision, and how transferring to Cornell would further your academic >interests.  
Would love to hear everyone's thoughts!no and especially because transfers are processed after regular admissionsUgh I’ve been searching for this info! Thank you!I stupidly waited until the last minute to submit a request to be sent for a college report to Cornell as a transfer. I wasn’t aware it took 2 weeks to process. Will it be an issue if my college report gets sent out 2 weeks after the deadline? Supposedly they won’t look at your application until they have that document.It’s a very good accomplishment. I think the acceptance rate is 20% maybe even lower (this year).Took my a second to figure out wtf Nolan was hahaIs getting accepted to Nolan a big deal or not? I see basically everyone who applied to Nolan getting accepted, including me LOL. Congrats Everyone!Try to find someone at your current school who handles transferring and can give you advice on what to do to prepare as best as possible for applying to Cornell. You can look at cornell’s econ page and find what courses they recommend you should take before transferring too, based on your year in college (at least CALS has this on their webpage). Cornell should also have many resources online with tips on how to prepare to apply as a transfer. Make sure you write a nice essay and get a good reference letter too, and maybe try to buff up your extracurriculars too if you think you are lacking.Current UC Irvine freshman here. I am an econ major and want to transfer to Cornell my junior year fall. My GPA is around 3.8. Can someone who transferred to Cornell as an econ major or anyone who transferred here pls give me tips on what I can do?This is called a likely letter. I received one that said almost exactly that, but not from diversity outreach. They probably are writing yours because you add diversity to Cornell in some way they really liked. It's them letting you know that you are accepted, but Cornell can't officially tell you that until Ivy Day because that is the contract the Ivies make with each other. Likely letters are a way around that. Congratulations and welcome!Congrats 🎉🎊🎈Thank you so much![deleted]Will try to be as genuine as possible here. I am currently a senior who has an extra semester left because of COVID. Not exaggerating when I say that it is the best of times and the worst of times here. The weather is ass for more than half of the school year and seasonal depression gets real when we don’t see the sun for weeks. If you’re not from the northeast like me, make sure you really prepare with a good quality winter coat (there are reasonably priced ones plz don’t get a Canada goose 😭) and boots etc. ofc it depends some on your major, but overall the academics are very rigorous here and once your first exam of the semester passes by they just keep on coming until you graduate… time management is key and if you are accustomed to being at the top of your class in high school, like most of us were, prepare to get reality checked. 

Like any other school, finding your place at Cornell is essential and will make or break your experience. I almost dropped out twice (hence the leave of absence) but am still here because of the connections I’ve made with people and communities at Cornell. I wouldn’t give these relationships up for the world. My best advice is to immerse yourself in whatever clubs/activities you can that suite your interests and try to be as social as possible even though it seems like the most daunting thing when you first arrive on campus. Opting for a roommate(s) when you select a dorm situation is not only cheaper but will help you make friends in the long run. Work/life balance is the greatest challenge for all of us but it is the life connections I’ve made that convinced me to stay here.Aside from it being hard for me to move away from home, I love Cornell and am generally very happy here. There is so much nature which was a college necessity for me, but also do many amazing buildings and places to explore, on top of all the opportunities here. The reddit unfortunately becomes a place to complain and ask questions, so it can be off putting, I remember thinking the same. Don't let it scare you.Cornell was a waste of my time and a mistake I regret. 

A name is not everythingIf you can overcome seasonal depression then you’ll love Cornelldont trust reddit. most people here are loners or depressed or both. ive had a fantastic time here despite the ups and downs.Thank you so much for replying! Cornell still seems a bit scary but you make it seem way more doable. I'll continue considering it.I'm a junior in highschool, looking to apply to Cornell. After a couple months on this subreddit it seems like people are mostly displeased with their experience at Cornell. Is this just typical complaining or should I rethink my plans to apply?

Are you guys generally happy or do you regret going to Cornell?Accepted into Grad school at Cornell- are they good at providing financial aid? And what are some good opportunities ? Thanks !Not guaranteed technically anymore after an incident a couple years prior. However very very highly likely. She can study at any university Cornell accepts credits from. On her majors website she can see what courses she must take and which are recommended in order for it to stay valid and the grades she must maintain in themSame questions here but for college of AgHi,  a friend of mine got in to school of Human Ecology as Transfer option  at Cornell.  She applied for freshman year. 
1) does this mean that she has guaranteed admission to Cornell ? ( provided she meets GPA requirement )
2) Can she study at any local college in freshman year ? 
3) are there specific courses to be taken in freshman year local college to get to the transfer ?Honestly Cornell is what you make of it. Don't stress yourself out  too much or put too much pressure on yourself and you'll do just fine. The weather here is very strange but on the days that there is sun, Cornell transforms into a beautiful place. Everyone starts to socialize more, people will relax on the lawns and play games. I find these days so beautiful. There are going to be hard days and there are going to be good. For me the good parts of Cornell are the times I spend with my friends. Those times where we are just sitting together and studying or playing games in our dorms. Everyone here is very motivated to do good and there are those who are super competitive. If you come here and give it some time you will find where you belong.What’s so great about Cornell? I’ve heard really good things about the Ivy League, but I have no idea what to expect from it.You definitely got this. Incredible work you have done. Don’t stress.[deleted]The shift is night and day. I did minimal work at CC and had 4.0. At Cornell, I had several classes where I was thrilled to get a B while busting my ass. Think about the student demographics; CC is largely average to below average students (some exceptions of course), whereas at Cornell, the typical student is top 1 or 2 percentile. Re: class size, if you're coming in as a junior, you'll likely miss some of the giant classes that many frosh and soph take, but you'll still have some big ones as a junior and senior (this can vary widely by major though). The biggest difference you'll notice is the pace and the amount of work. Something that you might cover in 2 or 3 classes at CC, will be covered in one class at Cornell, and then it's on to the next thing. At CC, you may get about 5-7 hours per week for a "heavy" class; that's considered light at Cornell. I had a few 3 credit classes where I was spending about 15 hours average per week. To summarize: it's much more demanding and rigorous than CC, and hard work alone won't always cut it; you need to be pretty smart as well. Best of luck!Hello everyone I’m a Prospective transfer:

Just wondering if anyone can provide insight on the shift from community college to Cornell. How much harder are the classes? I’m Going in as a CAS government major so how big will the classes be? Any insight greatly appreciated thank you.I was accepted off the waitlist on the 4th.Any movement on the COE 2026 waiting list ?Chance Me!

Varsity golf 4 years, captain 1 yearYes. Usually the rule is that double majors must be in the same college, but minors can be across colleges. Do double check with the relevant schools and departments websites as there are sometimes caveats.Ok, thanks so much :)In that sense, do CALS and DYSON count as the "same college" that one can double major in?If you are in Dyson, you can request to double in a CALS major at any time [1]. If you are in CALS, you must request to double in AEM (Dyson) only during your freshman or sophomore year, and is not allowed for transfer students [2].

[1]
https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/major-changes-and-double-major

[2] https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/double-major/Is it harder for a CAS student to get approval for a double major in AEM than for a CALS student?~~I would assume so given this notice:~~

~~"Note: While meeting or exceeding the above criteria will increase your competitiveness, it does not ensure approval to double major in AEM."~~

EDIT: I completely misread your question. If you are in CAS, you will probably not be allowed to double major in AEM since they are in different colleges (and concurrent degree is no longer available).

Dyson website: "Students with another major in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) may apply to double major in Applied Economics and Management (AEM)"

CAS website: "If you decide to add another major, it must be within the College of Arts & Sciences"QUESTION

is it possible to major in an arts and sciences field and minor in a CALS field? Basically, it is possible for your major and minor to be from different schools?Application straight into the garbage. /s

Come on, stop worrying about it. You are fine.aightStraight A minuses first semester of my junior year but counted as a 4.0 in my high school  
Does Cornell admisisons mark me down for this?It is certainly possible, as long as you keep a high GPA. The more difficult process will be getting the A&S versions of classes recognized for a Eng degree. You will get the best answers from the COE Internal Transfer page and FAQ:
 https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/advising/internal-transfer-engineering

https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/advising/internal-transfer-engineering/internal-transfer-frequently-asked-questionsThanks! Do you know anyone who has done this?No, but if you search the subreddit for "internal transfer" you will find many posts on the topic.I know someone who did this, I believe it took them 5 years to graduate instead of the usual 4. I can't remember if it was because they ended up double majoring in chem and cheme or if cheme requirements took an extra year to finish. Most cheme classes are offered fall only or spring only so the latter seems most likely.cool, thanks againWow, thanks for the info. Merry Christmas!How difficult is it to switch from Arts and Sciences to Engineering (chem to chemEng)?I believe the fencing team recruits, not sure if they take walk-ons. either way, if you get in, I would contact the head coach to ask about walking on.Ok yeah i will, but also i just felt like if i indicated interest on my app they might take that into consideration and maybe it would be a positiveCornell Fencing

Hello, I have recently submitted my application to Cornell. I am also a fencer and am interested in fencing in the case I attend Cornell. How do I indicate this to the school?If you are more interested in data science, I would say ORIE is probably more applied and has more of the data science aspect. Other than that, CAS has more liberal arts requirements and a language requirement, while COE has more science and math classes in its core curriculum.Thanks so much! I took a deeper look at the degree requirements and decided to do statistical scienceHi, I'm conflicted as to what school to apply to. In Cornell Engineering,  I'm thinking of applying bc of the ORIE and in Cornell CAS, I'm thinking of applying bc of the statistical science major. I don't really have a preference in the curriculum so is there a big difference between either and which would fit me more with my interests in applied math/stats/data science?I am very confused between your posts. Are you currently a junior or a senior?

If you are a senior, I am greatly confused and you would need to prove extenuating circumstances to Cornell about your high school mathematics curriculum...

If you are a junior, I hope you get some calculus experience before graduation (high school, community college course, self study, etc). While CAS requires that 3 units of math are completed, COE "requires" 4 units where one of which is calculus. (Requires is in quotes since it is not something you will be immediately rejected over in a situation where your school does not offer calculus).

Regardless of school, CS wants to see both rigor and excellence in mathematics so unless you are failing, I would recommended trying to stick through honors.Sorry about the confusion as of now I am a junior in high school, and as for calculus I'm taking pre calculus next year since I started with algebra 1 and not geometry in my freshmen year. Overall I will have 4 years of math but it wouldn't include calculus(my school offers it I just can't take it since I need pre calc), although I have been looking into ways that I can speed it up via a summer course to take calculus in my senior year.Definitely take precalc this summer, try your local community college maybe and check with your counselor if they would accept that. If your school offers calculus and you don't take I'm pretty sure it puts you at a very big disadvantage.Hi I want to go into Cornell for computer science and I am currently a junior, I have never taken any low level classes and in my three years of highschool I have taken every AP and Honor class there is but, algebra 2 is really beating me down, would it hinder me heavily if I did regents alg 2? I know there are many factors but this is something i'm unsure of.one of my friends who majored in government got to do a whole semester in washington to work as an intern and study. I think the actual program is Called Cornell in Washington. he also was placed directly into an internship with the city of ithaca...so most of it is really just networking and job experience from what i've personally heardyeah i think cornell in washington is a big thing for gov majorsBesides research what beyond the classroom opportunities are there for sociology/government majors?Hd and psych are still separate majors so while as an hd major you have access to the psych classes (as with any other department in any other class) they wont necessarily count towards the hd major requirements.its also moreso what you actually want to do...don't apply to a&s just cause you think thats easier, instead think about what you want to learn outside of the major. doing psych in a&s will mean that you are taking things like language, quantitative reasoning, and overall just more hollistic ed. While hum dev is centered on the dynamics of the human race--and while both departments have a lot of overlap, you cant double major in them anyways, and only a certain amount of out-of-school credits will even count towards your major. glhi! I read that cornell's psych and human dev departments merged so I'm very conflicted now, should I just apply to humec instead of A&S because of the slightly higher acceptance rate? I don't see why I would need to apply to A&S because all courses would be available to me in the super-department. Any psych majors please lmk any insight!Just letting you know, dual enrollment courses do not transfer over to Cornell.I thiught they did, but at half the creditTypically, dual enrollment refers to college courses taken to satisfy high school requirements. If you took these classes at the same time as high school but not for graduation, they may be eligible for credit (given some other criteria are met).

Here is the CALS policy: https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/non-cornell-credit/college-credit-earned-while-high-school

I have a decent amount of political/government ECs, but no major competitions. I did Boys State, political campaign canvassing, am class treasurer, and represented my school at a youth conference. I am also an officer in my school’s multicultural club and a member on the mock trial team and environmental club. My other activities include math tutoring, a job, local volunteering, and varsity tennis. 

I know most of my ECs don’t directly relate to math and science, but that’s because I want to become a lawyer, and I love math (law schools accept any major). My supplemental focused on my passion for math and how I would hopefully use my degree at Cornell to thrive in law school and as a lawyer. 

My personal statement was also really solid, I’d like to think. One of my colleges sent me a letter saying it was one of the best they had read all year. 

So with that information, do any current students think I have a shot? Thanks!Check the weather for when you’re going to be here. Then, pack for 15 degrees above and below. Bring layers so you don’t need to bring a heavy jacket if it gets cold. Bring super comfortable shoes, you will be walking a LOT!I'm not a student, but I'm from the northeast, and I have to second that layers are your best friend here! Bring a bag to carry water and extra layers with you, it's much better than tying things around your waist or over your shoulder. The weather often contradicts itself, too, as it can change quickly- hence the saying "If you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes.". Especially in spring, it may feel hot in the sun (especially if you wear dark clothing), but freezing cold when a cloud or breeze passes by.Im visiting Cornell mid April for the admitted students event. Is there anything I should know/prepare for? I come from the tropics so advice on what to wear is welcomedKeep in mind that transferring isn't easy. Most transfers are TOs (basically Cornell's 1-year-delayed-acceptance).I know transferring is hard, especially for A&SWhat does TO mean???Transfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.ohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set upAdvice for transferring to Cornell?

  
Hi there, I got rejected ED to CAS probably in part for not taking my college applications seriously enough. After that I pretty much decided that I would try to transfer to Cornell my freshman year of high school. Recently I got into a top 3 liberal arts college not in New England (thou shall not be explicitly named) but I am still very determined to try and end up in Ithaca. I was wondering if it matters what institution I will be transferring \*from\*? Does it matter what calibre school I previously attend? Will it make the reasons for applying to Cornell (which I have surmised are very important in the application process) weaker/will they like it because its a good school? I could also go to a place like Fordham fwiw.  
  
Has anyone else transferred to Cornell from a LAC?  
  
Thanks if you respond, sorry if this post reads like gibberishAs a fellow highschool science fair presenter, congrats on that first place at your regional fair! You should be proud of yourself :)Hey, I am sorry to be so annoying! Could somebody chance me? I am having a meltdown about decisions coming out next week 😍
~GPA: 4.0 Unweighted and 4.508 Weighted (7/260)
~ ACT: 33 and 10 on Writing
~ I am out of state and applied to CALS for Environmental Studies.
~ On my midyear report, I  had 13 AP classes and 4 AICE classes which are kind of similar to AP, but a little easier.
~ My ECs are being president of science national honor society, getting third place in regional science fair junior year, getting first place in regional science fair my senior year, treasurer of the marine conservation club, tutoring since the 9th grade, and helping take care of the marine lab at my school.
~ My personal essay was about how the suburbanization of the area around my home led to me finding my passion about environmental science.
~ My why CALS essay was about how coming from a small town I had a fondness for Cornell’s diversity and how I admired and wanted to contribute to research project like Professor Wrege’s Elephant Listening Project!
Thank you so much! 
~To any sophomore transfers into Cornell CAS or Engineering with a bad high school GPA, what did you guys do to pad you resume freshman year of highschool and do you have any tips for me. I regret not taking high-school as seriously as I should’ve and ended up with a pretty bad GPA. Any advice would be appreciatedThey start coming out ~3rd week of April and are typically sent out every Tuesday until as late as June. From my experience, a TO acceptance is more or less guaranteed if all requirements are met. All of the TO applicants I know that met all requirements and didn’t get accepted were in HumEcAnyone have any idea when TO decisions come out? I know they said Mid-April but around when (based on previous years). Also, how likely is a TO acceptance if all requirements are met?I started going track my sophomore year of hs! I only did cross country my junior and senior year! Absolutely loved track/xc (despite my number of injuries) and I met some great friends. I encourage you to do extracurriculars that YOU care about and not ones soley the basis of impressing a college. This is exactly what I did in hs and I was admitted this year in the rd round to CALS at Cornell. Good luck!It's totally fine to join in sophomore year. That's more than I did (I didn't do any sports at all), so don't worry.I have a question about sports in admissions.

I’m a current freshman and am involved in marching band, concert band, a community service club, art competitions + classes, and science activities. I want to beef up my application a bit so I can make it into possibly Cornell in the future. I wanted to join a sport this year but didn’t feel ready. Next year I would love to join track or cross country with my friend. I have no prior sports experience but I like running. I’m not just joining because it will look good but I also want to be more active.

My plan is to do track/cross country until senior year. Will it look weird if I join sophomore and not freshman year and will that negatively affect the admissions process? I’m worried that I’m lacking in my freshman year compared to others who are doing sports currently.

Also I’m not one hundred percent sure if I am allowed to post this on the thread or not. If not just let me know and I can take it down.It looks like there are  two with that last name - Robert and Jon. Here are their webpages at Cornell with their emails

https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/

https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/Waitlisted student here! If it’s not too weird, can someone please provide me with Prof. Kleinberg’s (CS Dept.) email? Would really appreciate it.Chance me! Prospective junior transfer into mechanical engineering here. I'm currently a freshman at my state school with a 3.8 GPA that will probably end up being a 3.9 by the end of this semester. I'm concerned because I blew off my first year and took half music classes (I'm an avid jazz pianist/vocalist), but I have enough AP credit to still be roughly on track. High school was really rough for me, as I got kicked out of the house during my junior year and ended up taking a part time job while living in a rental basement. I ended up skipping senior year, but had to take 5 online courses in 6 weeks because some credits didn't transfer. I ended with a 3.2 unweighted GPA.

I was diagnosed with PTSD sometime during my HS junior year, and have been struggling severely with it. I had to drop two classes (both part of my major) this semester, which officially made me a part-time student, because I realized that I was completely neglecting my mental health and propelling myself towards burnout. Instead, I'm spending my time pursuing my passions (music dev for an indie game) and volunteering for Breaking Code Silence, a nonprofit organization dedicated to taking down the very systems that caused my trauma. I'm really taking the time to better myself, but I'm afraid that this part time semester will look bad on a transfer application. My grades are great, but I also haven't participated in any research...

I do have a 36 composite ACT though, so there's that.

The only major preparation I've really completed so far is Calc III, chemistry, and an introduction to engineering course. After this semester I'll also have Statics and Physics E&M under my belt. I'm planning on taking Linear Algebra and Dynamics over the summer. Next year I'll (hopefully) take a basic coding class, physics III (optics and relativity stuff), intro to circuits, differential equations, material science, computational methods, mechanics of solids, and a CAD course. I'm hoping that I'll be ok if I can demonstrate that my part-time semester helped me become a healthier person capable of taking on heavier coursework.

I'm interested in transferring to Cornell because I want to go into mechatronics, and that robotics minor looks spot on for what I want to study. My current school doesn't offer a robotics OR mechatronics minor, so I'm doing an electrical engineering minor since it's the next best thing.question about college life at Cornell! 

hi! I am looking to apply to Cornell in the fall but the one thing that is holding me back from ED is the college life and weather. I tend to dislike the cold a little bit more and I enjoy going out to cities and towns with my friends. Cornell is often described to me as a place with not a lot to do and very cold. So, how really is the college life there? Are there a lot things to do? thanks in advance :,)Question about transition from HS to Cornell:
Does Cornell have placement exams you have to take, or do AP and IB credits work fine? I feel like I’m missing something.Hi everyone. I was waitlisted but the other day I got an email requesting a 250 word essay on why BS-ISST. Does Cornell send this request to all that were waitlisted? Anyone else get this? Thx.0 Chance, 1370 unless you have a crazy link to Cornell (generations of legacy, donor parents etc) is an auto-reject score.What are my chances if:
I have a 98.50% GPA
Have a 1150 SAT —> I will hopefully increase this to 1370 on my next attempt through my studying for math 
Courseload: all maxed out with AP comp sci A , APUSH, AP world, AP Psychology self studied, with next year senior year having AP music theory, AP bio or AP chem I’m not sure yet
Extracurriculars: not many which is what I’m worried about, president of coding club for a short period after some time we stopped doing it, National honors society member, Varsity winter track , Varsity spring track, and Cross country at one point, due to Covid I was limited back in freshmen and partially sophomore year trying to make up for it now, this summer I plan to do lots of volunteer work in a hospital or community service. I also plan to build up many programming projects to add on my application. 

I want to major in biology (interested in dentistry) or computer science (software engineering) anything I can do in this summer to increase my odds or help with my lack of extracurriculars? Thanks 
Also unweighted GPA is 96%

Background: I’m part Egyptian and part Pakistani I live in NY, not the first generation in my family to go to college.Lmao... i submitted 2 days agoWhat’s the longest time someone has waited for the Cornell waitlist? Submitted my loci for CAS on May 3rd and I fear it was too late :(Nah, you don’t need standardized test scores for transfersI am looking to transfer to Cornell in Fall 2023, and I currently go to ECU. Is it recommended that I take the SAT or ACT?Anyone got the transfer option? kinda confused rnProspective student here. Am soon going to be studying at my local university, the University of Melbourne. I was wondering if international transfers to Cornell are harder than local US transfers? i.e. from NYU → Cornell, or is the general transfers rate the same.Hi everyone, I am a college freshman and I was admitted to CALS Information Science as a transfer student. I wonder how hard it would be for me to internal transfer from CALS Information Science to CoE Computer Science. 

Besides, I've already taken discrete structure and cal II from my current university, which corresponds to CS 2800 and Math 1120 at Cornell. Should I take these courses again at Cornell since I noticed on the website it says "Note that only grades from courses taken at Cornell are considered in affiliation computations."

Thanks in advance.sorry for posting this again, but anyone gotten off CALS waitlist yet?Gpa and sat score don’t matter as much as you think. There are a lot of people who apply with the same stats. The admissions officers are not going to be like “Hmmm, this kid got a 1510 and this kid only got a 1500. I’m gonna take the 1510 kid”. They look at the essay to decide. They want someone who will add to the community, not someone who holes up in their dorm reading doing test prep all day.If you have a low gpa, Cornell would want to see a high SAT score to make up for it. 1500 might not be high enoughkind of a chance me kind of not, I just feel so paranoid about my application for sha because my gpa was a 3.7 (90) our school doesn't do uw. I do go to one of the specialized high schools in NYC (bxsci) and took aps and college courses but I'm super scared I wont get in because of my gpa. I have confidence in my ecs, writing, reccs, and sat (1500) but its just my academics that are like making me feel like I won't get in :(( are there any current or previous hotelies who could explain what the general qualifications for sha are?When I got accepted last year, I don’t think I got anything in the mail. We did get an online code for a free class of 2025 t-shirt though!When did you get that? I believe we haven’t received one yet.Do the people who got accepted ED get a letter in the mail or goodies? If so, when?Not international but for your ECs they don't have to relate at all to your career. Do whatever you like and that's all that matters. Cornell has hundreds of clubs and the people in them come from all kinds of majors.Alright, a general question. Those have you who have applied internationally, what were you ECs? And should our ECs be related to our career path?For a regular action applicant trying to major in Biology, is there any portal astrology stuff I can look into?There's no set number, but it's an expectation that you're taking a more rigorous and challenging courseload that's offered by your school. Some people's schools don't have AP or only offer a low number. I took 11, and I have friends that took 0 (no APs or IB offer at their school, but still was rigorous)How many APs we need to write for Cornell and Ivy League. It is a dream to join an Ivy League college.since you didn’t qualify for usapho getting into cornell will be toughThis is  insaneI hope this is a joke. Burn please.u sweaty mfreally good profilehuh this is a joke right idkHaha thanks:( not a jokesorry igyea but im an indian maleHi can someone please chance me for Cornell Engineering?

https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/Hi, I'm asking for a friend cause she's not on Reddit, but do these materials include Cornell's Supplement?Probably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.1/2/2022

Does the deadline date mean due before  1/1/2022 11:59 pm  
Or 
Does it mean due before 1/2/2022 11:59pmHi! I submitted my application for Human Ecology a few days ago as a prospective DEA student and was wondering if anyone here could tell me a little bit more about the actual experience of the major, like how many people are in it, interactions with professors, studios, etc. Ik a lot of general facts through my research for my application, but it would help a lot to hear about real experiences from DEA students!hi I’m sophomore in highschool does someone in Cornell is willing to do tutoring sat???Current SHA soph here. I sort of did the same thing when I applied. I couldn't decide between AEM and A&S and so I applied to SHA for fun also I saw the low acceptance rate at AEM and so I leaned into my host job and got in. The reason the major can be boring is only because it is so broad. Yes, the hotel administration major is broad. Idk ur exact interests but I like finance and so i find stuff like food management boring. but maybe u dont! It is unlikely someone loves finance, financial accounting, food management, and hospitality development. (ps i heard a rumor they arent making all the classes mandatory but instead optional with different tracks in like a couple years) Luckily, the classes are not usually that much of a grind so u can just focus on other stuff when they are boring. The major has a fair bit of elective space so u can just load up on other stuff u like. Another good thing is that the connections are rly rly good especially in hospitality and u arent locking urself into the industry whatsoever. I know a lot of hotelies that put business administration on their resume and no one thinks twice about it. u can check the employment stats but a lot of hotelies dont go into hospitality  (9% only) and instead just do finance (26%) or real estate (26%). the real estate is top of the line here. imo one of the best places to become a real estate analyst. the business dress fridays is called deans distinguished lecture series and its a 1 semester core course, so its not like a regular thing except maybe for a seldom presentation. its not that professional. hotelies are known for being pretty chill imo. im always willing to help out. ur other questions are a bit harder for me to answer but ill do my best. Ithaca is a super unique town so i think it should be a sizable consideration for ur college pick. super cool scenery and isolated i would say. although, the airport is quite nice just doesnt have a ton of flights. the depression meme is a person by person case i would say. there is a big greek life culture especially as part of the biz school. there are also plenty of people who avoid that kinda stuff (me). u can def have ur choice at that here. at least at sha, i would say people are generally happy. the professors at sha are for the most part phenomenal and caring. lastly, congrats! I knew a lot of very qualified people who did not get it, so i wouldnt even consider it an easy path

\-[https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/careers/employment-statistics/](https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/careers/employment-statistics/)

im free to talk more anytime if u wanna, just dm me :)barely any parties outside of greek life, people are not really happy and very stressed here. honestly if ur not super into hospitality i wouldn't recommend coming (Hotel '24)Congrats 🎉🎊.Got in on the same day. I feel the exact same as you. I also applied to Harvard so I'm just waiting for April, 6th with no expectation.Hi!! I just got in too but I was not expecting to get in. I’m the opposite, I love management and food service. I was wondering if I could ask u a couple of questions about the environment and course rigor? I have no idea how I got accepted I’m such a an average student hahaWho are you friends with!? Omg I feel like I got the least sleep in my life during undergrad - in the best way.ThanksAsk what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.Got into SHA yesterday. Sort of applied because it was the easy way in. I have work experience in restaurants and enjoyed doing that. Thought, hell, I’ll apply. Wrote my supplemental essay about starting a brewery which is definitely something that I have thought about doing in the future. I just don’t know if I want to spend four years of college majoring in something so boring. I don’t give a shit about hotels. I’m kind of stuck taking business courses and I wish I had more time for social sciences. And then I’m stuck in one industry for the rest of my life rather than getting a versatile degree like economics and actually working in the hospitality industry if that’s the direction I decide I want to go in. Entrepreneurship specialty would be great though. Not a huge fan of the business-dress Fridays though. Whole thing seems awfully professional for a college experience. I think that’s what they’re going for, just don’t know how to feel about it. Fine beer and wine class would also be dope though. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

How are Cornell as a college and Ithaca as a town though? Is the depression as bad as they say it is? If so, I’m gonna steer clear. Big on parties outside of Greek or do people lean more towards studying/not drinking in their free time? Do students feel happy while going to school and doing their work or sad and stressed most of the time? Ithaca seems cool; I’ll probably visit some time this month. Any other thoughts on campus life/social scene/culture?No, you just take classes.How does affiliating majors work for CS. Do I have to write essays?Applying undecided doesn't give you an easier change of transferring. As the other comment says, applying to Arts & Sciences is a good move because their whole things is allowing people to have a diverse education. So you could talk in your essay about how you have all these interests you have build up and want to continue (if you do) while still pursing a STEM education. 

If you know you want to be engineering for sure, I would recommend applying directly to engineering because it is one of the harder schools to transfer into, and you don't want to get stuck in A&S if that is for sure what you don't want to do.Math, CS, and hard science majors like Physics, Chem, Bio are offered in Arts and Sciences. So if you get in for history or humanities you can easily switch to those majors.

Switching to the engineering college is another matter, but you don't necessarily need to do it to pursue stemHello!

I'm a rising senior and Cornell is definitely one of the schools I'm considering to apply to during the fall. The problem is .. after 17 years of my life believing I'm want to go into law (major in poli-sci, get into law school, you know how it goes) .. I found that I have a higher affinity dedicated to math and STEM.

Because of this, I've spent my high school career building my extracurriculars around poetry, debate, and philosophy, so instead of making engineering my intended major (even though I have nothing related to that field what-so-ever), I'm thinking of applying under "undecided" or political science, then transferring.

I know Cornell ranks very high in engineering, so I was wondering how easy it is to transfer from a humanities major to an engineering one. Also, if I apply undecided, would I have an easier chance of transferring?

what are my chances? i am applying for ILR

btw im legacy (3 generations)I'd be more than happy to read it :)Can anyone at cornell please read my ilr essay? Would be appreciatedMasters student in MAE here. My old roommate and I both studied mechanical engineering in undergrad at cornell. He went to columbia for grad school and I stayed in ithaca. We have compared experiences a lot throughout last semester and this is what we discussed:

-Columbia is a big name for a reason, but its not engineering.

-Cornell's engineering, at least the MAE department (and probably others!), is wonderful. The classes are fantastic, they push you, they are interesting, the department/faculty CARE about you as an individual, and there are many choices for courses. None of those things could be said for my friend's experience at columbia.

-Columbia is in NYC, cornell is not. My friend very much enjoys living with friends in NYC and had MUCH more time to enjoy himself and have a real life outside of class than I did in ithaca. I seem to be getting better prepared for career recruiting/work after school right now as a result of this.

Keep in mind this is for grad school, but I imagine the trend is similar for undergrad comparisons. Also, my friend did not stay in mechE when he ditched for columbia (still engineering though).

Id pick cornell engineering > columbia engineering any day. Hope this helps a bit.Cornell Engineering vs Columbia Engineeringintro, body paragraphs, conclusion xDWhat program are you applying to?Hi, I'm applying to College of Human Ecology, and I have no idea how to structure my essay. Can someone in the college, please help me? It's urgent.? If you’re talking about the thanksgiving dinner at RPCC then no. It’s just thanksgiving-style dining hall experience.I am curious about Cornell's thanksgiving dinner. Are there any interesting activities during the dinner?How selective is that program at MIT? That could make a huge differenceHmm not super sure but I'd say pretty selective! There are like 35 other kids with me. But again, it’s a stem thing and I wanna do a more humanities major so idrk. What are you thoughts about my overall chances tho?Good enough to certainly applyAnything to improve?Also, will USESO be impressive? I was a finalistIt is discernable that your spike aligns with neuroscience more than humanities. Again, your chances very much depend on the prestige of all your activities. Where were those research papers published? What professors did you work with? What organisations recognize your app? That kind of stuff can make the difference between Stanford and Georgia Tech[deleted]Hi! I don’t think one or the other is better. Its just what you want to go into. Either way you can apply to minor in the other. I would look at the classes and talk to current students to figure out which vibe fits you better. Your stats seem good but those wont be the standout thing so definitely figure out which supplemental essay feels like a closer fit. Best of luck!Guys would I be better off applying to Dyson or CS?

Hello!  
I'm looking to apply to Cornell for fall 2022 admission. I'd like to know more about DEI opportunities at Cornell from a current student. Please comment if you would be able to chat with me about this! Thanks! :)Yes, but keep in mind that for the first two years, most of your college resources will be dominated by the college you're primarily in, regardless of whether you intend to double major or not.Hey everyone! I'm going to be applying to Cornell and I'm confused about the intersection between CALS and Dyson. To offer a little context I'm a high school senior who's very interested in food systems and sustainability as well as business and economics. So the schools that are most appealing to me are CALS and Dyson. I know that if I'm accepted into Dyson, it's quite simple to do a double major in CALS, but if I get accepted into CALS, is it relatively easy to do a double major in Dyson?  
I'm just so confused, because on the CALS website, it shows Applied Economics, Applied Economics and Management, Environmental, Energy & Resource Economics as major options for undergraduates, but those options do not show up on Common App.  
I'm really worried because I don't want to apply to either Dyson or CALS and then screw myself over by having to sacrifice either of my interests.  
Apologies if my post is a little unclear. Basically my question is: If I am accepted into CALS, is it relatively easy to study economics/business though a double major with Dyson/SC college of business?1. See this commend thread:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/rhe8jn/chance_me_and_prospective_student_qa/hponq79


2. You can take data science courses as a stats major (or any major for that matter), but InfoSci offers a specific concentration in data science. (Majoring in CS / InfoSci will give you priority access to the higher level CS / InfoSci classes. This is extremely important since they fill up very quickly and can be difficult to get into due to high demand.)
 https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/ba-information-science-college-arts-sciences/degree-requirements-0-1^^this but to your 2nd point stat/btry majors are now CIS students so same priority enrollment as info/csAh thanks, didn't know! Bowers CIS can be confusing.Hi, I'm applying to Cornell this year and wanted to know the difference between the statistical science major and the biometric and stats major, as well as which one (or any other) you'd recommend for a career in Data Science/ ML.InfoSci is offered in A&S and CALS. The graduation requirements for InfoSci in CALS includes 18 credits of Life Sciences, of which 6 credits must be Intro 
Bio and at least 3 credits must be Chem or Phys. So yes, you can certainly do InfoSci with a bunch of Bio.

For more information, see the Degree Requirements pages for:

InfoSci (CALS):
https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/bs-information-science-cals/degree-requirements

InfoSci (A&S):
https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/ba-information-science-college-arts-sciences/degree-requirements> this stupid class I don't really care about.

honestly i'm a little perplexed by this comment considering you want to be a biometry major.. you realize that's a lot of statistics right?The basic stats class at my college is equivalent to an AP Stats class where all the content is outdated and taught wrong. I like statistics, but I don't want to take a class where all the principles are irrelevant to classes further down the line if that makes sensefair. i feel like infosci and biometry are similar enough majors in terms of learning outcomes, and if you have already fulfilled most of the requirements then you'll have more room in your schedule to take bio classes - good luck!applying for transfer fall 2022. I am currently a CS major and biochem minor at the school I currently go to, but I'd ideally be a Biometry major at Cornell. I noticed that applicants need to have taken a stats class which I have not done here. I mean, I could, but the problem is that I'd have to take on extra credits next semester or drop a class I wanted to do for my minor.  I don't want to do this though– if Cornell denies me then I'll continue having to take this stupid class I don't really care about.

OTOH, I did notice that I have most of the classes done for InfoSci done. Should I just apply for InfoSci instead? Can InfoSci majors have biology centered classes sort of like Biometry majors do? Or should I just suck it up and take the basic stats class next semester?For admissions, you must have taken 3 courses in the sciences. Additional units of advanced mathematics and science (including biology, chemistry, and physics) are highly recommended but not required. From an applications perspective, assume you will be completing against students that taken high level science courses (AP / IB / etc.).

https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/admissions/

While you are in Dyson, you will have to take two introductory biology / life sciences courses to fulfill you distribution requirements. You must also take at least one course in physics or chemistry, and another course in any physical or life science. Basically, you can get away with only having to take two biology courses while at Cornell.

https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-requirements/distribution/You only need to satisfy distribution requirements of which there are many classes that might satisfy the same distribution requirement, Cornell is quite flexible. I’m not a bio person either but there are a number of easy bio classes here as well that satisfy bio requirements (we have a bio requirement in CAS as well)For the three course in science, i have a general studies in science 10, chem 12, and chem ap but I’m not sure if that’ll count for the courses required.Oh thanks! I’m just wondering in terms of applications if I’m applying to dyson and possibly double majoring in global development, if not having any biology courses will hurt me.I very much doubt you would have any issues thereHello!

I’m planning on applying to Dyson AEM and CALS Global Development and was wondering if not having a background in biology would hurt me. My counselor is worried that since Dyson is originally from the agriculture and life science school, that there would be overlaps that require biology.It is not a deal breaker.Hi, Im planning to apply as an undergraduate to the college of Engineering for CS. I didn't take any APs because my school is British and doesn't offer any. I do have gce A level grades tho:

Gce AS-level exam results:
Physics - A
CS - A
Psychology - A
Mathematics - A

I've noticed one of the listed requirements for undergrad admission at Cornell's school of engineering is at least 1 unit of chemistry...

Now, I've never touched chemistry once, not even in grade 10 and below.

Will I be rejected if I apply for the school of engineering? I've written all my supplementals already and really want to get into Cornell.

Thanks in advance.Seems like consideration for Milstein happens after RD release, so I would assume it does not have a bearing on admissions.

> The director and faculty selection committee will review application materials and a select group of applicants will be ​contacted in March and invited to schedule an interview. Interviews of Milstein finalists will be conducted either virtually or in person during April, and decisions will be released to interviewees prior to May 1. Only those applicants offered an interview will be notified in the spring. Non-finalists will not be contacted.

But do make sure to consider this quote from the program site:

> After checking the interest box for the Milstein Program on the Common App, applicants should use the supplemental College of Arts and Sciences essay to explain how they are a good fit with the Milstein Program.

https://milstein-program.as.cornell.edu/current-high-school-studentsHi! Quick question: If I check the box for Cornell that I want to be considered for the Milstein Program, does anyone know if that affects your chances for just getting into Cornell in general?

I'm not sure if it's a completely separate process that has no influence on getting accepted regularly (for context, which I'm indicating that I'm interested in the College of Arts and Sciences for biology).

Thanks!> I don't really have any engineering extracurriculars.

> I live in NY.

I think you answered your own question. Go with CALS and get that in-state tuition.[deleted]The interview is not really an interview. It is just a conversation with an alum. They dont report anything back to admissions. Its just to allow you to learn more about the school.So I am getting my interview this week and I am afraid of being asked the infamous question, “Why Cornell?” 
I am applying for biomedical engineering btw so how do I approach this? 
What is unique about the field in Cornell?If you are in CAS, you definitely have the room to take BIONB classes and obtain the background relevant for doing research.

Please see the NBB website for Undergraduate Research: https://nbb.cornell.edu/undergraduate#undergraduate-research[deleted]Clubs are super competitive and most have three rounds of interviews with very low acceptance rates (lower than the university itself)I think the other answer was about project teams, CS clubs are more collaborative and welcoming and usually just have one interview with a higher acceptance rate (for example, ACSU usually accepts 30-70% of apps depending on subteam). In general the CS major is pretty competitive bc of internship opportunities, though most CS classes have group projects.>Are there any specific group projects you enjoyed

Lots of classes have group (or partner) projects. CS 2110/2112, 3110, 3410, 4300, 4410, 4670, 4740, 4780 are all classes I took that involved collaborative projects/homeworks (so almost every single CS class I took at Cornell)

>Collaborative CS related clubs?

Some project teams (not all) are competitive to get into, but to be fair, this aspect isn't unique to Cornell. My friends at UIUC had to apply to get into project teams, business frats, and other similar types of pre-professional clubs. Once you get in, it's pretty collaborative. 

>Any specific classes that are collaborative? 

Cornell CS has a practicum requirement. You can look into those classes.

>And is the cornell student body collaborative?

Yeah, I think so. I guess everyone is trying to get jobs like the other comment said, but that doesn't mean they're not going to be friendly. Most people I talk to are willing to help out and work together. I don't think this is unique to Cornell. I would think (and hope) students at almost every CS program are like this. I can't imagine any college where students are so competitive they're not willing to help their friends out.

>Are there any specific places where CS students like to meet up to study?

Duffield Hall, Upson Hall, the undergrad CIS lounge in Rhodes Hall

I'm guessing you're trying to write your Why Cornell essay. If so, I would suggest taking another angle maybe. Collaboration and teamwork are things you'll find almost everywhere, idk maybe someone will disagree with me.Thanks for sharing, that's definitely useful info.  Are you a CS major btw?What is there to be said about collaboration within the cornell CS department?  Are there any specific group projects you enjoyed or collaborative CS related clubs?  Any specific classes that are collaborative?  And is the cornell student body collaborative?  Are there any specific places where CS students like to meet up to study?Apply to arts. It’s more flexible in terms of selecting a major and sounds like the best fit base on your interests.[deleted]What college do I apply to?

Currently stuck between applying to engineering, AS, and CALS. I have a loose interest in engineering and want to minor in business or statistics. I am in advanced physics and math courses but I don’t have the best calc Bc grade. My extracurriculars aren’t really science based or engineering specific and have a lot more to do with writing but I did data science research with a mentor. As a female I heard my chances are better for engineering but I still don’t know which one would be the best for me in terms of admissions and academic freedom. 
Any help would be appreciated thanks!yes, you can. who are you trying to do research with?thank you! the research is relating to public health do you know if this also applies to cornell's grad schools? can you research with a cornell grad school faculty as an undergrad?Yes, you can!thank you!!Can students at cornell cas do research with faculty at cornell humec?ILR ≠ Business. I wouldn't apply to ILR unless you have a strong reason to. Based on your interests, it seems like these are all reasonable options:

A) Major: CS (in CAS or COE), IS (in CAS or CALS), ISST (in COE); Minor: Business, DBME \[Dyson Business Minor for Engineers\]

B) Major 1: IS (CALS); Major 2: Applied Economics (CALS) (same as last part of post)

C) Major: Economics (CAS); Minor: CS

Given that it is likely that your opinions will change as you take your first few classes, applying to CALS will give you the most flexibility in the future.Thanks! 

ILR acceptance rate is higher than CAS and CALS and it had business courses that's why I was exploring that.I would ignore this conception of pure "acceptance rate." ILR is a specialized college and as with any specialty school, you will have less overall applications where more of the candidates' profiles are aligned with that specialty. You will notice from 2021 admissions statistics that ILR has an extremely high yield (number entering vs number accepted).

|College|Applied|Accepted|Entering|Rate|Yield|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CAS**|30,670|2,191|1,285|7.14%|58.6%|
|**CALS**|6,679|820|604|12.3%|73.7%|
|**ILR**|1,304|224|168|17.2%|75.0%|Another major you might want to consider is ORIE in the college of engineering (maybe combined with a CS minor) since ORIE has a lot of the stats/data science/machine learning classes as well classes that focus on applications in business and finance specifically.Help me decide which college or major to apply, Cornell is super-reach for me.

GPA: UW 3.74, W 4.17, CA Bay Area Competitive School, ACT: 35, 3 APs (APCS 5, APUS 3, AP CALC AB 4) & 4 Honors till 11th, 4 APs in 12th

EC: (1) Founder of 2 non profits (with actual work and growth in last 2 years), (2) Eagle Boy Scout, (3) Varsity Sports Team Member (not recruited athlete), (4) Community Service Project for saving food wastage (5) Ongoing research project (Data analytics and ML) for underprivileged student's (6) Ongoing research project (Data analytics and ML) for CAL fire (7) Google Data Analytics Certificate

My interest is in learning CS + Business + Data Science and my ECs are kind of mixed because of that. I can apply to ILR as noticed that it have Data Science concentration and business courses, but it does not have any CS courses. 

One option is (if got admitted to ILR) to do CS minor along with ILR. However I do not have any ECs to talk about Labor (other than hiring for my non-profits or volunteer for my local congressman) or law or workers.

Other option is to apply for CALS IS and then try to do double major in business economics but this option will be more competitive to get in than ILR one.Im so sorry to hear that :(  I think if your interview essay is good, you'll be at a small disadvantage but dw! as long as your portfolio is good, you'll get in! I understand the feeling of missing an interview-- i almost missed mine haha. 

Don't worry if you dont get in, its such a small school... i believe the incoming class is about 30 students. There's so many other architecture schools out there, just make sure you have choices open!Thanks for replying, I submitted my interview essay and believe my portfolio is good but I know I’ll be competing against an extremely talented array of students and haven’t been able to get feedback on my portfolio from someone with experience to determine how it compares to other students. Being February, I’m in that limbo of not having the stress of submitting applications but also not having the relief of knowing if I got in anywhere. Thank you for your advice and kind words, where I get in for undergrad isn’t an end-all-be-all (but fingers crossed for Cornell :)Help with Architecture Admissions!

Hi, I’m a prospective student applying for Architecture undergrad and during my rush to complete my applications I forgot to sign up for an interview (which is apparently necessary for the Architecture program). I know there’s the essay option available but believe that having an actual interview would be a lot more beneficial. Please, is there any way to schedule an interview after Dec 17? Thank you in advance for any alumni who read this, Cornell is one if not my top school and I feel like I’ve lost any chance of getting in.In 2018, Dyson had 4,168 applications, 122 acceptences, and 90 students entering. That is a 2.93% acceptance rate and a 73.8% yield.

In 2021, Dyson had 5,053 applications, 275 acceptences, and 175 students entering. That is a 5.44% acceptance rate and a 63.6% yield.

Happy New Year everyone, I was just wondering the true acceptance rate of Cornell AEM

I've seen it at 3% and I've seen posts saying it's higher. Some even say higher than CAS

Just want to know the true acc rateI didn’t submit a resume since my common app pretty much covered it for me, but if you have other experiences to share (like work, certifications, etc) then the resume would probably be the place to do so.I would say activities not listed in the common appWhat is Cornell looking for with the resume submission? Do they want activities not listed in common app, or is it moreso to show how you will take your career?The Biological Engineering (BE) major is offered by both CALS and COE. The Biological Sciences (Bio) major is offered by both CAS and CALS. If happen to be in CALS, you can double major in Bio and BE. Double majors must be within the same college. If you are planning to major in Bio in CAS, you cannot double major in BE but you may minor in BE. (Note: Cornell has discontinued the dual degree program)I read on the University's website that I could enroll in biological engineering before the end of my sophomore year. My question is : can I major in biological engineering while already majoring in biological sciences ?Cornell will look at your score if you self reported on Common App or submitted a score report College Board.Not sure if someone can answer this, but where is the question asking whether or not I want Cornell to look at my SAT? All of the other schools I’m applying to ask that in their college-specific questions, but I don’t see it in Cornell. How am I supposed to know if Cornell is going to consider it? Btw, applying for college of arts and sciences, so sat should be test optional according to their website.Accepted CS class of 26 ED and submitted my 1460. Checking with some random stats I believe with a 700 eng and 760 math I was exactly in the 50th percentile for engineering school. Idk enough to say if you should or shouldn’t but it worked for me.I think you should submit your SAT if possible. Also, admissions are by college and not major so you will be comparing against either CAS or COE.

Essays: ?/10

LORs: ?/10GRAD SCHOOL - Anyone at or has knowledge of the MS in Applied Economics and Management (AEM), how is the program for someone strongly considering a PhD afterwards? And how does the PhD track work?Not sure about the others but A&S has a lower admission rate because it's more popular! It has a ton of majors since the focus of the college is so broadYou can submit your music supp if you want, but not mandatory. I guess it depends on your situation. If you want to major in psychology and your essay is about music and the mind, the music supp would support that, for example.

College of human ecology has only 7 majors iirc which makes it less desirable than A&S which offers at least 60 majors. So less major flexibility in college of human ecology. But if you are absolutely sure you want to major in that area, ED to HumEc will boost your acceptance rate a lot. I think there’s a spreadsheet someone made on this subreddit that said ED HumEc acceptance rate was north of 40%?You can see the benefit of applying ED at this link. HumEc acceptance rate is actually around 50% with ED! https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jx54xf/cornell_ed_admit_rates_by_college_using_math/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfHello!! Here are some questions I have--I apologize if some sound too rudimentary... I know a lot of these questions can be answered by a quick Google search on my behalf, but I would love to hear the opinion of real students and past applicants!

I'm interested in Psychology. I would love to major in Psyc. or Human Development.  
(AFAIK)--Underaduate degrees for Psyc. are offered at the College of Arts & Sciences, and Human Ecology major is offered at The College of Human Ecology. What is the difference between these two colleges and majors?  Is one college harder to get in to than the other? (I think that requires research on my behalf--but I would love to talk to someone who is involved in one of these colleges/college branches!) Please forgive me if we aren't allowed to post links--but this website says the College of A&S has a 8.8% accep. rate and The College of Human Ec. is 23%.  [https://www.powerfulprep.com/how-to-get-into-cornell/](https://www.powerfulprep.com/how-to-get-into-cornell/)   
Why? Is it because of number of applicants? I heard that A&S has more apps. and students. Is it because of that? 

Does admission rate go up/down based on major popularity?

College of Arts & Science people--how come there is a musical supplemental? Should I submit my supplemental even if my major isn't in relation to music? I play Bb Clarinet, Violin, & participate in vocal ensemble. (Music supplemental is optional)

Would my chances of being accepted be affected by not submitting my SAT/ACT/Other test scores? I would be applying 2023, Cornell has prolongated that extension to 2023 (current HS Jnr.)

Does being a NY Resident affect chances of admission, & chances of early admission? What would the chances be of admittance for a NY resident who doesn't submit test scores? 

Thank you so much for your time and the read. Have a good one and please stay safe. :)No an ipad will not be enough. Every engineering major needs to take an intro to programming course, and you will need an actual computer for that. Most majors also have specific software that you will need to use on a computer. You can use the computer labs, but it will be massively inconvenient (wasting many hours per week probably). If you are only getting one device, get a laptop not an ipad.while the other person is right that having your own laptop will be handy, there are plenty of ways around this. several libraries on campus have desktop computers with plenty of programs on this that you would never bother getting on your own computer. I never found this massively inconvenient, in fact i typically preferred using the desktops in the libraries because they are way bigger than my laptop screen, and some libraries have two desktops at one station for dual screen, and the engineering library has touch screen desktops. it's a good point that for intro to matlab/python you might like to work on this stuff on your own computer, but what i did when i was working on a spreadsheet for ex, is i would just email it to myself at the end of the day. you could also just get a flash drive. ALSO, you can rent laptops from the library. Last semester my computer was broken so i just kept renting laptops. There's longterm leases for two weeks and also 3 hour renting. Protip: you can check out a 3 hour laptop, and then just renew it every three hours for infinity. there's never so much demand that they ask for the laptop back. and you can ask to renew it like an hour before closing time at the library and that'll make it due the next morning so you can keep it overnight. and you have like an hour or two window after the 3 hours before their system starts sending emails insisting you'll be in trouble if you don't bring it back. But i think you would actually manage just fine with just an ipad, just keep in mind you will need to use cornell computers in some way at some pointOk thank you so much!!!Would an ipad pro be enough for an econ major in A&S?No idea. I would still recommend a laptop, since you can do much more.Hi! I am going be a engineering major and I am asking for tech recommendations. I am going to be getting an iPad Pro with the keyboard and I was wondering if I will need a lap top as well. I really don’t know what programs I will end up needing so I was wondering if my iPad will be enough. Thanks!You'll need a GRE score... And GPA boost likely.

I switched schools after my junior year of high school I went from a private boarding school to a public school and my teachers have assured me that none has ever even applied out side the city from my present high school and that can also be verified that I had to manually enter the name of my school in the application.  Will this negatively affect my application as due to this switch the number of debates and events that I could partake in decreased exponentially as my present high school does not provide any opportunities. Does the admission team reject application from small towns and public schools in favor of students from prestigious institutions in the westI wouldn't worry about Cornell looking down on the fact that you're from a small town and had less achievements/activities/advanced classes than people from cities and prestigious high schools; Cornell takes into consideration the opportunities you actually have available to you, and simply look at how you were able to use the resources around you to the best of your abilities! You might even have a slight advantage because you stand out among students who usually don't reach for such prestigious universities. And since you said you took the best classes you could, and have quite a few unique and impressive achievements, you seem pretty qualified to me!Thanks for the kind words I am actually trying to piggy bank on the uniqueness on my application to get into CornellCan someone chance me please?

3. English TeacherYou need 120 credits to graduate, averaging \~15 credits a semester. You will need to take \~5 classes a semester to grad in 4 years. But, you are always more marketable and ready for a career the more you do, so I wouldn't personally recommend just trying to the minimum. Take advantage of what Cornell can offer you![deleted]As poster above said, the bare minimum basic math = 120 credits divided by 8 semesters = 15 credits a semester. If all your classes were 3 units that would be 5 classes per semester.

But it isn't tidy like that. A&S (CAS) requires a language, which could be 4 or 6 credits. Many classes are 4 credits and require 1 or 2 credit labs. And you pretty much have to do the work on your schedule yourself to find the classes that meet the requirements of your major. There are resources like: [https://courses.cornell.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603) for you to read thoroughly. And there is a huge chance you will change your direction during the first two years that Cornell gives you before you declare a major.[deleted]Not sure if it will be mcclintock but the entirety of north campus where freshmen live is uphill lol. I’ve seen people skate around so not impossible but probably easier going to classes then coming back.Where will the freshmen all girls dorm be next year if Balch is closed? I heard it might be McClintock Hall, is this true? Also if it is McClintock Hall, is it an uphill walk to get there? I would like to bring my skateboard to travel but I don’t know if paths are too steepNearly no differences in terms of research for undergrads...but if you're interested in getting minors or experiences in engineering-related fields, e.g. BME, BE, etc., CALS would be a better choice.Hello! I am currently working on my application to Cornell as a transfer student and my intended major would be biological science with a biochemistry concentration. Bio majors can apply to CALS or CAS so which one should I choose?

(My internship will also hopefully be 12th grade, and it is counted as a course (divided into seminar first semester, and mentorship second semester) and is weighted as a 5.)GPAs are calculated strange in my district, my 100 point weighted is like a 97ok, if the classes are taught be a high school teacher at a high school then i don't think Cornell would count them as college credits. Cornell doesn't allow dual enrollment credits from what i understand (ie my high school taught College Chem instead of AP Chem and i didn't get any credit for it at Cornell because my high school chemistry teacher taught it, even though it really was like the same material as Chem 2070 at cornell). If it's a college professor teaching at the high school, that might be ok, but i'd look into Cornell's policies about it (and whatever other colleges you apply to)I had a C in College Algebra for my first semester mostly due to me adjusting to the new scheduling my school had, while balancing 9 classes and seasonal depression.I might Early Decision to Cornell, does someone mind chancing me?

(Edited for new Info)Tbh, nobody will give you an accurate probability. But you have decent stats.

Also, you mentioned an exciting topic to talk about in your essay.

One piece of advice spend a lot of time browsing your intended school at Cornell to find the answers to why Cornell?. 
Essays are mattered a lot, so do your best. However, don’t stress over extras. 

Finally, I wish you all the best in your application progress and future endeavors.i had about the same extras as you so dont worry too much haha. you seem pretty good to me! like you're aware you're definitely not the most exciting candidate ever but for candidates of your level i feel like ive met ppl at cornell with similar profiles to you. i personally had less honor societies but i did theater my whole middle school/high school and had clear progression imo. but you're applying to hum ec which is a state school (i did cals im from nys too). so i think you have as good of chances as me and i got in (well maybe a little less idk how much cornell tries to reduce the long island/nyc/westchester kids they get). but yeah i dont think you're a 100% shoo in but no reason to despair i wouldnt be surprised at all if you get inThanks. I don’t know if any of this helps or matters, but I’ve been student teaching at my religious school since 8th grade, which is a big commitment. My peer court and gender equality work has been through high school(except for during Covid shutdowns). 

I’m also expected to finish in the top 2 of my class. Whether I’m 1 or 2 depends obviously on the rest of this year.I’d love someone to chance my.

My concern is the my extras really aren’t that exciting.J like list a ton of clubs/organizations/project teams u “plan on joining” and name drop like deadass at least 5 professors whose class u wanna take and whom you’ve “researched” aboutCommon App questions are confusing.  
I am a community college transfer and the common app asks to answer two questions. How you you guys advice splitting up my answer considering how similar these are.

Prospective CS studentI believe emails for HEOP RD came out about 3-4 weeks ago! I would contact their Diversity & Outreach office for more info considering it is time sensitive.I did and they prompted me to reach out to their email. However, they are yet to respond. I didn’t Submit my eligibility questionnaire until like feb 8.If not applying Cornell HEOP ed, typically when do Cornell HEOP rd consideration emails come out?when you transfer to CAS you come in undecided anyway (for sophomores at least), so i'd assume it's not based on major? Though if you have one major that aligns most closely with your application i'd say do that (though i applied as a gov major with a lot of cs related application materials, so that also can work)I definitely have a lot more stuff for EAS. I do research at my current institution in geodynamics making models that applies CS to geosciences, I tutor in Earth science, was the captain for Earth science in high school Science Olympiad where I won many medals. I'm just worried that Cornell might see my application as trying to "sneak in" to the school since I did apply to my current institution as a CS major before later declaring a Geosciences double major and I have a lot more classes in CS/AMS. I am genuinely interested in studying both though.Hi there!  
I was wondering if there were any transfer students here who decided to double major in CAS. I want to transfer to Cornell as a sophomore and plan to do a CS + EAS double major but I am really unsure of which one to apply as on my application. I have stressed the importance of both to me but on the Cornell transfer application it specifically says to choose one major. Does anyone know if transfer admissions to CAS are based on major or could give any input? Thanks very muchArts and sciences doesn't admit by major and all students enter as undeclared, so applying for a popular/uncommon major will not make it any more difficult/easier to get accepted.Hey Everyone. I will be applying to Cornell as an international student from Bangladesh. Cornell is my top choice university and I am thinking of applying ED this year.

 >Rickrolling or a Rickroll, is an Internet meme involving pranking an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up," performed by the English singer Rick Astley. The meme is a type of bait and switch, usually using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected, and they have been "Rickrolled". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics, or singing it, in unexpected contexts.

Also, if you have any advice on how to differentiate this essay from the human ecology one of "How has your decision to apply to the College of Human Ecology been influenced by your related experiences? How will your choice of major impact your goals and plans for the future?" Thanks!Asking for a friend who is looking to transfer here. The essay prompt is “how does continuing your education at a new institution help you achieve your future career goals?” Anyone have any advice on how to write this essay? Or examples of what to include? We’re both kind of confused. Thanks in advance!Think about it as past, present, and future. What has happened in your past and what have you already accomplished that has led you to your modern aspirations and goals. In other words, “how did something in the past shape my present?” Ive seen students use this to explain their motivations and ‘why’. 

For the present: Why would transferring to Cornell at this very moment play a vital role in your life? Why now? What can Cornell offer you that you can’t find anywhere else? 

For future: care about your legacy. You are joining a community of thousands of Cornellians. How will this help your goals? Where do you see yourself carrying the Cornell name and where will you take your own? 

Idk if that helps, but that’s how I would look at it. :) best of luck!Quick question that I see many others asking but I want to phrase it more clearly. The two prompts for transfers are essentially:

1. What is your major how did past academic or work experience influenced your decision, and why do you want to go to Cornell.

2. Personal Statement: How does transferring to Cornell help your future?

These prompts are relatively similar and both contain an aspect of wanting:

\- a section of writing about your own character

\-a section of writing about why you'd want to go to Cornell

&#x200B;

Including a paragraph or two of each of the above bullet points in each essay satisfies each prompt, however it feels choppy and repetitive. Has anyone thought about doing the first essay all on your own character and why you stand out, and the second essay focused just on why Cornell is beneficial for you?

&#x200B;

I feel like this is a more logical approach but it disobeys the prompts, so I'm in a dilemma.Hey, I'm just a little confused now because. there's a prompt for the Transfer Option application, but there aren't actually any word limits or anything so I don't know what admissions expects or wants...."Please share how the experiences during your freshman year have helped to prepare you for a transition into Cornell University CALS and impacted your intended academic goals." Does anyone have advice for that?What is your end goal? What do you want to do with your education? That’s the most important question. Why do you want to study law as well as human development? How will you apply those two concepts to further your career? 

Good luck!I am currently a junior in high school planning on applying to either Cornell CAS or Human Ecology ED. As far as major goes, I would be most interested in Human Development. For science classes I have taken Honors Integrated Science (Chem/Phys), Honors Biology 1-2, and AP Environmental Science. Next year I plan on either taking Honors Chemistry or AP Biology. On the website it says “1 unit of biology, 1 of chemistry and/or physics, and additional core sciences such as advanced biology”. Does APES suffice for a fourth science? I am unsure as to whether or not it falls under the umbrella of “additional core sciences”. I plan on being pre-law so I didn’t put a ton of emphasis on science during high school, so if this doesn’t count I’ll have to rethink either my senior year schedule and/or decide whether I should apply to Human Ecology or CAS. Please let me know your thoughts/any advice you may have. Thank you!I'm just curious, but why MechE instead of CS, given you did USACO? But I think you have a very strong application, and probably be admitted, but I'm just a student.I’m applying for mechanical engineering in college of engineering

I have a couple of national competition stuff, namely me getting USACO Gold, then a 5th place & 7th place award for national math competitions (MAO if any of you are familiar with it), and AIME Qualifier

I went to a computer science summer camp at UCF (University of Central Florida)

  
My essays were ok, I’d say my personal essay and one of the supplementals were pretty good but the other essay was pretty whatever lol  
  
I’m also Cuban lol  
  
My main concern for my app is that aside my competition performance, everything else is kinda mid. Coming from people who have gotten in, what would you say are my odds of getting accepted?the transfer class at dyson is actually huge so the admissions rate is much higher than the regular undergraduate class. imo the most important things to set your application apart is how much you resonate with dyson values / the core mission statement and how you embody that in day to day lifeDoes it make a difference being a Junior versus a Sophomore transfer?im not too sure tbhTransferring from CC to Dyson (in-state) 

Does anyone know how easy/hard it is to transfer to dyson AEM from an in state community college?? My advisor says that people transfer there all the time but I was wondering if someone who did this could tell me how difficult or easy it is.Hi guys, I applied to the MEng ORIE program in November, gave my video interview on 7th Dec and then there was no communication. I then wrote to them somewhere in Feb asking about the general decision release timeframe and they said it’ll be by end-March. Based on the past, when did people hear back and also what is the average profile of an admitted student?Dyson is under SC Johnson Business, which is not CALS. Both are generally easier programs than say economics in CAS. ILR is more of a human resources degree, and then you can specialize in econ. Dyson is more of a business degree, where you can also choose to specialize in econ. ILR will land you HR jobs; Dyson will land you more business jobs. Pretty self-explanatory.So do you think if I wanted to go into finance or banking it would be better to go to dyson or ILR?Dyson for sureDyson is definitely better, but there are many ILR students going into finance as well.

ILR has a higher acceptance rate than Dyson (~18% compared to ~3%)Do you know anything about how easier/harder it is to transfer into one or the other??Can someone explain the difference between ILR and CALS(dyson) economics? Are admissions easier or harder for one over the other? I know they are both part of the state-side. Is there any cultural/social differences between the two??They look at applications holistically. One class should not make or break your application!Thanks. I know Cornell's transfer rates are inflated, but missing this one class has been stressing me out.Hi, everyone. I'm finishing my second year at a NYS CC this semester and applied to CALS for their Biometry program as a transfer. I have a 4.0, a bunch of awards and good amount of ecs; mostly as a lab assistant in the biology and chemistry departments as well as a math tutor. I feel good about my essay and I know I got awesome recs.

The issue is I have all but 1 pre-req completed and that's the rub. For incoming biometry majors they want 2 writing courses, Calc I, II, Linear Algebra, and two stats courses. I have all of that except a second stats course. My school doesn't offer a stats II and it wasn't available over winter on open SUNY. I do, however, have Calc III completed, which is not on the transfer requirement list but is a core course for the degree, and I'm hoping that will make a difference (CALS takes my school's Calc III as direct equivalent credit).

Does anybody have any thoughts as to if missing that one class is going to be a big enough problem for me to get rejected?For anyone in the graduate crop and soil science department, what is the likelihood of getting a masters degree in soil science fully funded? how do assistantships work at Cornell? when should I be contacting professors about the research they are conducting? any other grad school advice welcome as well. thank you!1. yes, but it doesn't count much, if at all. parents are considered a "primary" legacy, and have an effect on the applicant, whereas siblings are considered "secondary" and have little to no effect on the applicant.
2. no, deferred applicants will simply be put into the same pool as regular decision applicants and will be treated the same as themI’m a current student asking for a sibling: (1) is there sibling legacy, and (2) do deferred students have a higher acceptance rate than the regular admissions pool?They do have a math placement test for multivariable that you could study for to get credit for it.

Unfortunately I didn’t get in this year, but i’m going to try my hardest to transfer into Cornell Engineering next year. one issue that I saw straight on was that the Cornell Transfer website said that I needed Multivariable Calculus to transfer for a sophomore standing. Only problem is that my school doesn’t offer multivariable calculus freshman year. Any advice ?Sometimes it is the decision and sometimes people get it off of the waitlist.Got mine 2 years ago in my rejection letterDid you end up goingHow do you know if Cornell offers you a TO? Do they put it in your rejection letter or is it offered to you afterwards?Has anyone transferred into Cornell for the HEOP program from a program like SEEK or EOP? I’m planning to transfer from SEEK program and wondering if it’s even possible and what the chances areDon't put your name on a bus. It doesn't work.Hey guys, I just got waitlisted at Cornell (College of Agriculture and Life Science as a Biology major to be specific). I was just wondering what I can do right now in order to increase my chances at getting in? (By the way, the acceptance rate for Cornell waitlist is only 4% :( )Can anyone speak to:

What are hotel majors like? Competitive/cutthroat? Fratty? Materialistic? Chill?

How does the party scene work? I’m assuming it’s mostly around frat houses but how does that actually work with freshmen and sophomores? House parties?

How easy is it to minor or double minor? I’m interested in resource economics, art history, and viticulture.Typical Cornell CS student profile. Your chances are very good.I applied ED to A&S astrophysics major wit 4.3 and 1560 
Kinda shitty EC’s and rlly good essays 
Depending on ED size and how unique/good ur essays r I’d say ~50% chanceOk yea the school responded and said they do thx.Yes! Upload them :) Anything that will give you an edge to your app and your gut tells you to do it, do itI would not. An admissions officer doesn't want to read your academic paper.Idk man, you got a shot, so take itEarly acceptance letter into SHAWdym yesterday? The decisions don't come out till 31st March, right? I'm so confusedSince I don't know if anyone answered this for you I'd say that more than a couple Cs or a D/F is probably when you'd encounter a problem. However, be aware that the university will contact you first to ask what caused your grades to drop like that, so you might be able to make a case for yourself regardless of what your grades look like by the end of the academic yearFirst year! Senior in HS rn. Thanks!!!Congrats!Congrats! Did you get in as First-year or transfer student?BRO I ALSO GOT EARLY ADMISSION TO SHA! SEE YOU THERE!!thank you! That's what I thought but should I have some bio/ag-related extracurricularar to relate to the college (which I don't)?nope but definitely catered towards the CALS mission statement. I think I personally wrote abt my then-interest in medicine and math but I lowkey knew I wanted to do ds/finance lolHow do you do ds/finance in CALS? Do you double major or minor with Dyson?they are identical programs. if you are NYS resident it is most strategic to apply to CALS for less competitive admission and lower tuition.In the Why essay for CALS, should I focus on Stats or should I also mention biology/medicine-related experience or thoughts?No clue. Write about your own interests. Don't make up stuff that you aren't truly passionate about.Cornell admits by school, not by major. If you are a NY resident and apply to a statutory college (CALS, HumEc, ILR), you will have a better chance of admission.

Biometry is within CALS and Stats is within CAS, so if you do not have a preference of curriculum, you will theoretically have a higher chance if you apply CALS. Not to mention you will also get in-state tuition.Yeah, I knew that about the legacy, and that’s a shame about APUSH, but at least they’ll still see I did well on the exam. Thanks!Some things of note:

1) Cornell only considers legacy status during early admissions.

2) Cornell does not give credit for APUSH.
https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?catoid=45&navoid=18035Thank you! I’m glad to know that they’re test blind in this scenario. My school requires a certain passing score for the ACT/SAT so I’m working towards that though unfortunately 💔CALS is test blind so you don't need to worry about studying for the PSAT/SATuh oh my cool format didn’t work out but I hope this makes sense LMAOCS is definitely hard at GT but it’s not impossible. I would personally recommend Tech even as a current Cornell student because it’s kind of easier tbh than double majoring at Cornell.
Source: CALS transfer from TechI don’t know much about double majoring, but I also got into CS at GT last year and at an info session, they made it sound like it’s difficult to take many classes outside your major due to a pretty rigid curriculum. That was a huge turn off for me and considering that you’re thinking of double majoring, it might be for you as well. Definitely go to an info session at both schools if you’re able to!My 2nd choices were either Colorado State or UC Davis. I chose Cornell because it is the top in Animal Science and they offered good financial aid. I honestly didn't know that much about it before coming here and I wasn't certain about my choice up until the moment I accepted my spot here.Being a current student helps outI transferred here and I recall being able to submit only one letter of recommendation, so determine who you think wrote the best one. Also, it should be one of the three your professors wrote.

GPA is fine. It's not going to detract from your application.

In my opinion, the most important part of the transfer application is the "why do you want to transfer to Cornell?" essay. This profile you've posted here doesn't mean much. If you don't have legitimate reasons to apply to Cornell specifically you'll get rejected no matter what your stats look like at any of Cornell's colleges.  With that said, I think you can make a good case for wanting to come to Cornell for its many research opportunities, given your prior experience.It means they are looking for you have taken four years of high school mathematics, with at least one of those years including some form of calculus. If your school did not offer calculus, admissions will be understanding. If you chose not to take calculus, your application will definitely not be favorable (unless there are extenuating circumstances).I was informed by an advisor that pre-calculus does not count. However, your application will likely not be automatically rejected. Some courses are offered over the summer. I would look into that. It is possible that, if accepted, you could complete this before the fall semester.I'm transferring from a small community college in rural Virginia. Surprised so many credits would transfer over. Nobody in my family holds a college degree. Will these factors hurt my chances? I hear legacy students have the highest chance of admission..Not really. Legacy helps but it’s not huge. I would really explore your passions In your essay, I’d be happy to read it over if it helps but I’m just a freshmen in ILR

Tbh idk how many older students they take but I wouldn’t worry about legacy too much. Plenty of non legacy students get admitted, especially to ilr. 

Good luck!Decent chance, where r u transferring from? Also with a cool story like that I’d say it helps you out even moreMaterials can be submitted late, as long as they are received by January 10th.

https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/I think you should be fine, colleges usually give teachers some leeway with the deadlines. I had a similar issue with another college and still got in.To the best of my knowledge, you can minor in any available minor, no matter the school you are in and it is in. I have no idea if a dance minor exists, but you can google it.SO COOL OF YOU :OYes I am doing this exact thing, totally possibleThank you for the reply! I was worried because some people say I need to halve the general acceptance rate to get the acceptance rate for international student. Would it be that hard for international students not requiring financial aid or will it be slightly less if I don't ask for the financial aid?I'm not sure about exact numbers but I know it would definitely be easier. About 10% of Cornell is international but only ~40 internationals are accepted with aid every year, so the large majority are not on aid.Thank you so much for the help!It's a bit easier to get into CALS instate compared to oos. Being an international still puts you at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to domestic students even if you don't need financial aid. However, it mostly depends on where you go to school.Thank You for your response! I am happy to see you again here. How are you liking Cornell?Pretty good, the weather is crazy tho 😅Hi, former TO here!

It is mainly for new activities but you can also put any significant activities you did since you last submitted your application to CornellI read something about roughly 20% of transfer students were from CC in recent years. Looks like they don't put much weight into where transfers come from, so long as they fit in with the culture. I'm a fellow transfer applicant! Good luck :)I transferred to Cornell last Fall, and when I was working on the personal statement, I wrote about my potential educational and career paths beyond my time as an undergrad. I was partially interested in coming to Cornell to pursue academic research, so I wrote a bit about how that could lead to me attending grad school, to give you an example. To rephrase the personal statement the way I think it's meant to be interpreted: what do you want to do with your life after graduation?

The main essay was where I listed all my general reasons for wanting to attend, based primarily on the academic interests I had developed and the limitations of the school I previously attended.Ugh I’ve been searching for this info! Thank you!no and especially because transfers are processed after regular admissionsIt’s a very good accomplishment. I think the acceptance rate is 20% maybe even lower (this year).Took my a second to figure out wtf Nolan was hahaTry to find someone at your current school who handles transferring and can give you advice on what to do to prepare as best as possible for applying to Cornell. You can look at cornell’s econ page and find what courses they recommend you should take before transferring too, based on your year in college (at least CALS has this on their webpage). Cornell should also have many resources online with tips on how to prepare to apply as a transfer. Make sure you write a nice essay and get a good reference letter too, and maybe try to buff up your extracurriculars too if you think you are lacking.Thank you so much!This is called a likely letter. I received one that said almost exactly that, but not from diversity outreach. They probably are writing yours because you add diversity to Cornell in some way they really liked. It's them letting you know that you are accepted, but Cornell can't officially tell you that until Ivy Day because that is the contract the Ivies make with each other. Likely letters are a way around that. Congratulations and welcome!Congrats 🎉🎊🎈Thank you so much for replying! Cornell still seems a bit scary but you make it seem way more doable. I'll continue considering it.Will try to be as genuine as possible here. I am currently a senior who has an extra semester left because of COVID. Not exaggerating when I say that it is the best of times and the worst of times here. The weather is ass for more than half of the school year and seasonal depression gets real when we don’t see the sun for weeks. If you’re not from the northeast like me, make sure you really prepare with a good quality winter coat (there are reasonably priced ones plz don’t get a Canada goose 😭) and boots etc. ofc it depends some on your major, but overall the academics are very rigorous here and once your first exam of the semester passes by they just keep on coming until you graduate… time management is key and if you are accustomed to being at the top of your class in high school, like most of us were, prepare to get reality checked. 

Like any other school, finding your place at Cornell is essential and will make or break your experience. I almost dropped out twice (hence the leave of absence) but am still here because of the connections I’ve made with people and communities at Cornell. I wouldn’t give these relationships up for the world. My best advice is to immerse yourself in whatever clubs/activities you can that suite your interests and try to be as social as possible even though it seems like the most daunting thing when you first arrive on campus. Opting for a roommate(s) when you select a dorm situation is not only cheaper but will help you make friends in the long run. Work/life balance is the greatest challenge for all of us but it is the life connections I’ve made that convinced me to stay here.Aside from it being hard for me to move away from home, I love Cornell and am generally very happy here. There is so much nature which was a college necessity for me, but also do many amazing buildings and places to explore, on top of all the opportunities here. The reddit unfortunately becomes a place to complain and ask questions, so it can be off putting, I remember thinking the same. Don't let it scare you.Cornell was a waste of my time and a mistake I regret. 

A name is not everythingIf you can overcome seasonal depression then you’ll love Cornelldont trust reddit. most people here are loners or depressed or both. ive had a fantastic time here despite the ups and downs.Not guaranteed technically anymore after an incident a couple years prior. However very very highly likely. She can study at any university Cornell accepts credits from. On her majors website she can see what courses she must take and which are recommended in order for it to stay valid and the grades she must maintain in themSame questions here but for college of AgHonestly Cornell is what you make of it. Don't stress yourself out  too much or put too much pressure on yourself and you'll do just fine. The weather here is very strange but on the days that there is sun, Cornell transforms into a beautiful place. Everyone starts to socialize more, people will relax on the lawns and play games. I find these days so beautiful. There are going to be hard days and there are going to be good. For me the good parts of Cornell are the times I spend with my friends. Those times where we are just sitting together and studying or playing games in our dorms. Everyone here is very motivated to do good and there are those who are super competitive. If you come here and give it some time you will find where you belong.You definitely got this. Incredible work you have done. Don’t stress.The shift is night and day. I did minimal work at CC and had 4.0. At Cornell, I had several classes where I was thrilled to get a B while busting my ass. Think about the student demographics; CC is largely average to below average students (some exceptions of course), whereas at Cornell, the typical student is top 1 or 2 percentile. Re: class size, if you're coming in as a junior, you'll likely miss some of the giant classes that many frosh and soph take, but you'll still have some big ones as a junior and senior (this can vary widely by major though). The biggest difference you'll notice is the pace and the amount of work. Something that you might cover in 2 or 3 classes at CC, will be covered in one class at Cornell, and then it's on to the next thing. At CC, you may get about 5-7 hours per week for a "heavy" class; that's considered light at Cornell. I had a few 3 credit classes where I was spending about 15 hours average per week. To summarize: it's much more demanding and rigorous than CC, and hard work alone won't always cut it; you need to be pretty smart as well. Best of luck!I was accepted off the waitlist on the 4th.Just chill. Or get a job and make some moneyif your math/science background isn’t super strong, i highly recommend you brush up on some basic chem and calc 1. i’m a current freshman and while i was okay with chem 2090 because i have a stronger chem background, my math background is pretty bad and i wish someone would’ve told me to just relook at some basic calc. also if you can, just take the summer off and chill. i worked crazy hours throughout the summer and i never got a true break, which reflected in my studies this semester. you did all the hard work; relax and enjoy one of your last summers!Thank you! I applied ED as an incoming freshman.Congrats 🎉. Did you apply as a transfer student for Fall2022?My son was 3.97(UW), 4.75(W), 1530 SAT, two varsity sports and won state-level awards for musical performance.  He was just accepted ED.Ok, thanks so much :)In that sense, do CALS and DYSON count as the "same college" that one can double major in?If you are in Dyson, you can request to double in a CALS major at any time [1]. If you are in CALS, you must request to double in AEM (Dyson) only during your freshman or sophomore year, and is not allowed for transfer students [2].

[1]
https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/major-changes-and-double-major

[2] https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/double-major/Is it harder for a CAS student to get approval for a double major in AEM than for a CALS student?~~I would assume so given this notice:~~

~~"Note: While meeting or exceeding the above criteria will increase your competitiveness, it does not ensure approval to double major in AEM."~~

EDIT: I completely misread your question. If you are in CAS, you will probably not be allowed to double major in AEM since they are in different colleges (and concurrent degree is no longer available).

Dyson website: "Students with another major in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) may apply to double major in Applied Economics and Management (AEM)"

CAS website: "If you decide to add another major, it must be within the College of Arts & Sciences"Yes. Usually the rule is that double majors must be in the same college, but minors can be across colleges. Do double check with the relevant schools and departments websites as there are sometimes caveats.aightApplication straight into the garbage. /s

Come on, stop worrying about it. You are fine.Thanks! Do you know anyone who has done this?No, but if you search the subreddit for "internal transfer" you will find many posts on the topic.I know someone who did this, I believe it took them 5 years to graduate instead of the usual 4. I can't remember if it was because they ended up double majoring in chem and cheme or if cheme requirements took an extra year to finish. Most cheme classes are offered fall only or spring only so the latter seems most likely.cool, thanks againWow, thanks for the info. Merry Christmas!It is certainly possible, as long as you keep a high GPA. The more difficult process will be getting the A&S versions of classes recognized for a Eng degree. You will get the best answers from the COE Internal Transfer page and FAQ:
 https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/advising/internal-transfer-engineering

https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/advising/internal-transfer-engineering/internal-transfer-frequently-asked-questionsOk yeah i will, but also i just felt like if i indicated interest on my app they might take that into consideration and maybe it would be a positiveI believe the fencing team recruits, not sure if they take walk-ons. either way, if you get in, I would contact the head coach to ask about walking on.Thanks so much! I took a deeper look at the degree requirements and decided to do statistical scienceIf you are more interested in data science, I would say ORIE is probably more applied and has more of the data science aspect. Other than that, CAS has more liberal arts requirements and a language requirement, while COE has more science and math classes in its core curriculum.Sorry about the confusion as of now I am a junior in high school, and as for calculus I'm taking pre calculus next year since I started with algebra 1 and not geometry in my freshmen year. Overall I will have 4 years of math but it wouldn't include calculus(my school offers it I just can't take it since I need pre calc), although I have been looking into ways that I can speed it up via a summer course to take calculus in my senior year.Definitely take precalc this summer, try your local community college maybe and check with your counselor if they would accept that. If your school offers calculus and you don't take I'm pretty sure it puts you at a very big disadvantage.I am very confused between your posts. Are you currently a junior or a senior?

If you are a senior, I am greatly confused and you would need to prove extenuating circumstances to Cornell about your high school mathematics curriculum...

If you are a junior, I hope you get some calculus experience before graduation (high school, community college course, self study, etc). While CAS requires that 3 units of math are completed, COE "requires" 4 units where one of which is calculus. (Requires is in quotes since it is not something you will be immediately rejected over in a situation where your school does not offer calculus).

Regardless of school, CS wants to see both rigor and excellence in mathematics so unless you are failing, I would recommended trying to stick through honors.yeah i think cornell in washington is a big thing for gov majorsone of my friends who majored in government got to do a whole semester in washington to work as an intern and study. I think the actual program is Called Cornell in Washington. he also was placed directly into an internship with the city of ithaca...so most of it is really just networking and job experience from what i've personally heardHd and psych are still separate majors so while as an hd major you have access to the psych classes (as with any other department in any other class) they wont necessarily count towards the hd major requirements.its also moreso what you actually want to do...don't apply to a&s just cause you think thats easier, instead think about what you want to learn outside of the major. doing psych in a&s will mean that you are taking things like language, quantitative reasoning, and overall just more hollistic ed. While hum dev is centered on the dynamics of the human race--and while both departments have a lot of overlap, you cant double major in them anyways, and only a certain amount of out-of-school credits will even count towards your major. glI thiught they did, but at half the creditTypically, dual enrollment refers to college courses taken to satisfy high school requirements. If you took these classes at the same time as high school but not for graduation, they may be eligible for credit (given some other criteria are met).

Here is the CALS policy: https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/non-cornell-credit/college-credit-earned-while-high-school

(Similar policies exist for all colleges at Cornell)Thank youJust letting you know, dual enrollment courses do not transfer over to Cornell.In the upload portal, there is a spot for Optional Supplemental Material. Should I submit it there?Yup!LOCI is submitted on the portal. There should be an upload spot specifically for it.Whaaat??? That's incredible, congrats and good luck! 🤞😋 I'm also a transfer applicant, second letter of recommendation was submitted yesterday. How long after your application was completed did you get this letter?

|-|-|-|-|Hello!

Will do! Good luck to you too! :Dhey! did you get in?Hello!

I unfortunately got rejected, but will be applying to transfer next year for sure. 😭😭 90% chance youll get in, Ik plenty of Dyson kids and they have like half as many EC‘s as u wit similar gpaThank you!Honestly, I think you know you have a shot. Most applicants are very qualified, but not everyone can get in. At this point, it’s less about how qualified you are, and more about the fit; both Cornell as a fit for you, and you as a fit for Cornell. Good luck!“When” I get in. Haha—thanks for the positivity!Let me know when you get in (sadly my opinon doesn't count tho... im an applicant this year too).Check the weather for when you’re going to be here. Then, pack for 15 degrees above and below. Bring layers so you don’t need to bring a heavy jacket if it gets cold. Bring super comfortable shoes, you will be walking a LOT!I'm not a student, but I'm from the northeast, and I have to second that layers are your best friend here! Bring a bag to carry water and extra layers with you, it's much better than tying things around your waist or over your shoulder. The weather often contradicts itself, too, as it can change quickly- hence the saying "If you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes.". Especially in spring, it may feel hot in the sun (especially if you wear dark clothing), but freezing cold when a cloud or breeze passes by.I know transferring is hard, especially for A&SWhat does TO mean???Transfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.ohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set upKeep in mind that transferring isn't easy. Most transfers are TOs (basically Cornell's 1-year-delayed-acceptance).As a fellow highschool science fair presenter, congrats on that first place at your regional fair! You should be proud of yourself :)They start coming out ~3rd week of April and are typically sent out every Tuesday until as late as June. From my experience, a TO acceptance is more or less guaranteed if all requirements are met. All of the TO applicants I know that met all requirements and didn’t get accepted were in HumEcI started going track my sophomore year of hs! I only did cross country my junior and senior year! Absolutely loved track/xc (despite my number of injuries) and I met some great friends. I encourage you to do extracurriculars that YOU care about and not ones soley the basis of impressing a college. This is exactly what I did in hs and I was admitted this year in the rd round to CALS at Cornell. Good luck!It's totally fine to join in sophomore year. That's more than I did (I didn't do any sports at all), so don't worry.It looks like there are  two with that last name - Robert and Jon. Here are their webpages at Cornell with their emails

https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/0 Chance, 1370 unless you have a crazy link to Cornell (generations of legacy, donor parents etc) is an auto-reject score.Lmao... i submitted 2 days agoNah, you don’t need standardized test scores for transfersGpa and sat score don’t matter as much as you think. There are a lot of people who apply with the same stats. The admissions officers are not going to be like “Hmmm, this kid got a 1510 and this kid only got a 1500. I’m gonna take the 1510 kid”. They look at the essay to decide. They want someone who will add to the community, not someone who holes up in their dorm reading doing test prep all day.If you have a low gpa, Cornell would want to see a high SAT score to make up for it. 1500 might not be high enoughWhen did you get that? I believe we haven’t received one yet.When I got accepted last year, I don’t think I got anything in the mail. We did get an online code for a free class of 2025 t-shirt though!Not international but for your ECs they don't have to relate at all to your career. Do whatever you like and that's all that matters. Cornell has hundreds of clubs and the people in them come from all kinds of majors.There's no set number, but it's an expectation that you're taking a more rigorous and challenging courseload that's offered by your school. Some people's schools don't have AP or only offer a low number. I took 11, and I have friends that took 0 (no APs or IB offer at their school, but still was rigorous)huh this is a joke right idksince you didn’t qualify for usapho getting into cornell will be toughHaha thanksThis is  insane:( not a jokeI hope this is a joke. Burn please.sorry igu sweaty mfyea but im an indian malereally good profileHi, I'm asking for a friend cause she's not on Reddit, but do these materials include Cornell's Supplement?Probably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.The latter, but you are allowed to submit materials late, as long as it is received by January 10th.

https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/Hi!! I just got in too but I was not expecting to get in. I’m the opposite, I love management and food service. I was wondering if I could ask u a couple of questions about the environment and course rigor? I have no idea how I got accepted I’m such a an average student hahaAsk what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.Current SHA soph here. I sort of did the same thing when I applied. I couldn't decide between AEM and A&S and so I applied to SHA for fun also I saw the low acceptance rate at AEM and so I leaned into my host job and got in. The reason the major can be boring is only because it is so broad. Yes, the hotel administration major is broad. Idk ur exact interests but I like finance and so i find stuff like food management boring. but maybe u dont! It is unlikely someone loves finance, financial accounting, food management, and hospitality development. (ps i heard a rumor they arent making all the classes mandatory but instead optional with different tracks in like a couple years) Luckily, the classes are not usually that much of a grind so u can just focus on other stuff when they are boring. The major has a fair bit of elective space so u can just load up on other stuff u like. Another good thing is that the connections are rly rly good especially in hospitality and u arent locking urself into the industry whatsoever. I know a lot of hotelies that put business administration on their resume and no one thinks twice about it. u can check the employment stats but a lot of hotelies dont go into hospitality  (9% only) and instead just do finance (26%) or real estate (26%). the real estate is top of the line here. imo one of the best places to become a real estate analyst. the business dress fridays is called deans distinguished lecture series and its a 1 semester core course, so its not like a regular thing except maybe for a seldom presentation. its not that professional. hotelies are known for being pretty chill imo. im always willing to help out. ur other questions are a bit harder for me to answer but ill do my best. Ithaca is a super unique town so i think it should be a sizable consideration for ur college pick. super cool scenery and isolated i would say. although, the airport is quite nice just doesnt have a ton of flights. the depression meme is a person by person case i would say. there is a big greek life culture especially as part of the biz school. there are also plenty of people who avoid that kinda stuff (me). u can def have ur choice at that here. at least at sha, i would say people are generally happy. the professors at sha are for the most part phenomenal and caring. lastly, congrats! I knew a lot of very qualified people who did not get it, so i wouldnt even consider it an easy path

\-[https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/careers/employment-statistics/](https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/careers/employment-statistics/)

im free to talk more anytime if u wanna, just dm me :)Who are you friends with!? Omg I feel like I got the least sleep in my life during undergrad - in the best way.barely any parties outside of greek life, people are not really happy and very stressed here. honestly if ur not super into hospitality i wouldn't recommend coming (Hotel '24)ThanksCongrats 🎉🎊.Got in on the same day. I feel the exact same as you. I also applied to Harvard so I'm just waiting for April, 6th with no expectation.No, you just take classes.Applying undecided doesn't give you an easier change of transferring. As the other comment says, applying to Arts & Sciences is a good move because their whole things is allowing people to have a diverse education. So you could talk in your essay about how you have all these interests you have build up and want to continue (if you do) while still pursing a STEM education. 

If you know you want to be engineering for sure, I would recommend applying directly to engineering because it is one of the harder schools to transfer into, and you don't want to get stuck in A&S if that is for sure what you don't want to do.Math, CS, and hard science majors like Physics, Chem, Bio are offered in Arts and Sciences. So if you get in for history or humanities you can easily switch to those majors.

Switching to the engineering college is another matter, but you don't necessarily need to do it to pursue stemI'd be more than happy to read it :)Masters student in MAE here. My old roommate and I both studied mechanical engineering in undergrad at cornell. He went to columbia for grad school and I stayed in ithaca. We have compared experiences a lot throughout last semester and this is what we discussed:

-Columbia is a big name for a reason, but its not engineering.

-Cornell's engineering, at least the MAE department (and probably others!), is wonderful. The classes are fantastic, they push you, they are interesting, the department/faculty CARE about you as an individual, and there are many choices for courses. None of those things could be said for my friend's experience at columbia.

-Columbia is in NYC, cornell is not. My friend very much enjoys living with friends in NYC and had MUCH more time to enjoy himself and have a real life outside of class than I did in ithaca. I seem to be getting better prepared for career recruiting/work after school right now as a result of this.

Keep in mind this is for grad school, but I imagine the trend is similar for undergrad comparisons. Also, my friend did not stay in mechE when he ditched for columbia (still engineering though).

Id pick cornell engineering > columbia engineering any day. Hope this helps a bit.intro, body paragraphs, conclusion xDWhat program are you applying to?? If you’re talking about the thanksgiving dinner at RPCC then no. It’s just thanksgiving-style dining hall experience.Hmm not super sure but I'd say pretty selective! There are like 35 other kids with me. But again, it’s a stem thing and I wanna do a more humanities major so idrk. What are you thoughts about my overall chances tho?Good enough to certainly applyAnything to improve?Also, will USESO be impressive? I was a finalistIt is discernable that your spike aligns with neuroscience more than humanities. Again, your chances very much depend on the prestige of all your activities. Where were those research papers published? What professors did you work with? What organisations recognize your app? That kind of stuff can make the difference between Stanford and Georgia TechHow selective is that program at MIT? That could make a huge differenceHi! I don’t think one or the other is better. Its just what you want to go into. Either way you can apply to minor in the other. I would look at the classes and talk to current students to figure out which vibe fits you better. Your stats seem good but those wont be the standout thing so definitely figure out which supplemental essay feels like a closer fit. Best of luck!Yes, but keep in mind that for the first two years, most of your college resources will be dominated by the college you're primarily in, regardless of whether you intend to double major or not.^^this but to your 2nd point stat/btry majors are now CIS students so same priority enrollment as info/csAh thanks, didn't know! Bowers CIS can be confusing.1. See this commend thread:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/rhe8jn/chance_me_and_prospective_student_qa/hponq79


2. You can take data science courses as a stats major (or any major for that matter), but InfoSci offers a specific concentration in data science. (Majoring in CS / InfoSci will give you priority access to the higher level CS / InfoSci classes. This is extremely important since they fill up very quickly and can be difficult to get into due to high demand.)
 https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/ba-information-science-college-arts-sciences/degree-requirements-0-1InfoSci is offered in A&S and CALS. The graduation requirements for InfoSci in CALS includes 18 credits of Life Sciences, of which 6 credits must be Intro 
Bio and at least 3 credits must be Chem or Phys. So yes, you can certainly do InfoSci with a bunch of Bio.

For more information, see the Degree Requirements pages for:

InfoSci (CALS):
https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/bs-information-science-cals/degree-requirements

InfoSci (A&S):
https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/ba-information-science-college-arts-sciences/degree-requirementsThe basic stats class at my college is equivalent to an AP Stats class where all the content is outdated and taught wrong. I like statistics, but I don't want to take a class where all the principles are irrelevant to classes further down the line if that makes sensefair. i feel like infosci and biometry are similar enough majors in terms of learning outcomes, and if you have already fulfilled most of the requirements then you'll have more room in your schedule to take bio classes - good luck!> this stupid class I don't really care about.

honestly i'm a little perplexed by this comment considering you want to be a biometry major.. you realize that's a lot of statistics right?For the three course in science, i have a general studies in science 10, chem 12, and chem ap but I’m not sure if that’ll count for the courses required.For admissions, you must have taken 3 courses in the sciences. Additional units of advanced mathematics and science (including biology, chemistry, and physics) are highly recommended but not required. From an applications perspective, assume you will be completing against students that taken high level science courses (AP / IB / etc.).

https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/admissions/

While you are in Dyson, you will have to take two introductory biology / life sciences courses to fulfill you distribution requirements. You must also take at least one course in physics or chemistry, and another course in any physical or life science. Basically, you can get away with only having to take two biology courses while at Cornell.

https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-requirements/distribution/Oh thanks! I’m just wondering in terms of applications if I’m applying to dyson and possibly double majoring in global development, if not having any biology courses will hurt me.I very much doubt you would have any issues thereYou only need to satisfy distribution requirements of which there are many classes that might satisfy the same distribution requirement, Cornell is quite flexible. I’m not a bio person either but there are a number of easy bio classes here as well that satisfy bio requirements (we have a bio requirement in CAS as well)It is not a deal breaker.Seems like consideration for Milstein happens after RD release, so I would assume it does not have a bearing on admissions.

> The director and faculty selection committee will review application materials and a select group of applicants will be ​contacted in March and invited to schedule an interview. Interviews of Milstein finalists will be conducted either virtually or in person during April, and decisions will be released to interviewees prior to May 1. Only those applicants offered an interview will be notified in the spring. Non-finalists will not be contacted.

But do make sure to consider this quote from the program site:

> After checking the interest box for the Milstein Program on the Common App, applicants should use the supplemental College of Arts and Sciences essay to explain how they are a good fit with the Milstein Program.

https://milstein-program.as.cornell.edu/current-high-school-students> I don't really have any engineering extracurriculars.

> I live in NY.

I think you answered your own question. Go with CALS and get that in-state tuition.The interview is not really an interview. It is just a conversation with an alum. They dont report anything back to admissions. Its just to allow you to learn more about the school.If you are in CAS, you definitely have the room to take BIONB classes and obtain the background relevant for doing research.

Please see the NBB website for Undergraduate Research: https://nbb.cornell.edu/undergraduate#undergraduate-researchThanks for sharing, that's definitely useful info.  Are you a CS major btw?Clubs are super competitive and most have three rounds of interviews with very low acceptance rates (lower than the university itself)I think the other answer was about project teams, CS clubs are more collaborative and welcoming and usually just have one interview with a higher acceptance rate (for example, ACSU usually accepts 30-70% of apps depending on subteam). In general the CS major is pretty competitive bc of internship opportunities, though most CS classes have group projects.>Are there any specific group projects you enjoyed

Lots of classes have group (or partner) projects. CS 2110/2112, 3110, 3410, 4300, 4410, 4670, 4740, 4780 are all classes I took that involved collaborative projects/homeworks (so almost every single CS class I took at Cornell)

>Collaborative CS related clubs?

Some project teams (not all) are competitive to get into, but to be fair, this aspect isn't unique to Cornell. My friends at UIUC had to apply to get into project teams, business frats, and other similar types of pre-professional clubs. Once you get in, it's pretty collaborative. 

>Any specific classes that are collaborative? 

Cornell CS has a practicum requirement. You can look into those classes.

>And is the cornell student body collaborative?

Yeah, I think so. I guess everyone is trying to get jobs like the other comment said, but that doesn't mean they're not going to be friendly. Most people I talk to are willing to help out and work together. I don't think this is unique to Cornell. I would think (and hope) students at almost every CS program are like this. I can't imagine any college where students are so competitive they're not willing to help their friends out.

>Are there any specific places where CS students like to meet up to study?

Duffield Hall, Upson Hall, the undergrad CIS lounge in Rhodes Hall

I'm guessing you're trying to write your Why Cornell essay. If so, I would suggest taking another angle maybe. Collaboration and teamwork are things you'll find almost everywhere, idk maybe someone will disagree with me.Apply to arts. It’s more flexible in terms of selecting a major and sounds like the best fit base on your interests.[deleted]thank you! the research is relating to public health do you know if this also applies to cornell's grad schools? can you research with a cornell grad school faculty as an undergrad?Yes, you can!thank you!!yes, you can. who are you trying to do research with?Thanks! 

ILR acceptance rate is higher than CAS and CALS and it had business courses that's why I was exploring that.I would ignore this conception of pure "acceptance rate." ILR is a specialized college and as with any specialty school, you will have less overall applications where more of the candidates' profiles are aligned with that specialty. You will notice from 2021 admissions statistics that ILR has an extremely high yield (number entering vs number accepted).

|College|Applied|Accepted|Entering|Rate|Yield|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CAS**|30,670|2,191|1,285|7.14%|58.6%|
|**CALS**|6,679|820|604|12.3%|73.7%|
|**ILR**|1,304|224|168|17.2%|75.0%|Another major you might want to consider is ORIE in the college of engineering (maybe combined with a CS minor) since ORIE has a lot of the stats/data science/machine learning classes as well classes that focus on applications in business and finance specifically.ILR ≠ Business. I wouldn't apply to ILR unless you have a strong reason to. Based on your interests, it seems like these are all reasonable options:

A) Major: CS (in CAS or COE), IS (in CAS or CALS), ISST (in COE); Minor: Business, DBME \[Dyson Business Minor for Engineers\]

B) Major 1: IS (CALS); Major 2: Applied Economics (CALS) (same as last part of post)

C) Major: Economics (CAS); Minor: CS

Given that it is likely that your opinions will change as you take your first few classes, applying to CALS will give you the most flexibility in the future.Thanks for replying, I submitted my interview essay and believe my portfolio is good but I know I’ll be competing against an extremely talented array of students and haven’t been able to get feedback on my portfolio from someone with experience to determine how it compares to other students. Being February, I’m in that limbo of not having the stress of submitting applications but also not having the relief of knowing if I got in anywhere. Thank you for your advice and kind words, where I get in for undergrad isn’t an end-all-be-all (but fingers crossed for Cornell :)Im so sorry to hear that :(  I think if your interview essay is good, you'll be at a small disadvantage but dw! as long as your portfolio is good, you'll get in! I understand the feeling of missing an interview-- i almost missed mine haha. 

Don't worry if you dont get in, its such a small school... i believe the incoming class is about 30 students. There's so many other architecture schools out there, just make sure you have choices open!In 2018, Dyson had 4,168 applications, 122 acceptences, and 90 students entering. That is a 2.93% acceptance rate and a 73.8% yield.

In 2021, Dyson had 5,053 applications, 275 acceptences, and 175 students entering. That is a 5.44% acceptance rate and a 63.6% yield.

The Biological Sciences (Bio) major is offered by both CAS and CALS. If happen to be in CALS, you can double major in Bio and BE. Double majors must be within the same college. If you are planning to major in Bio in CAS, you cannot double major in BE but you may minor in BE. (Note: Cornell has discontinued the dual degree program)Cornell will look at your score if you self reported on Common App or submitted a score report College Board.Literally exactly the same. CS class of 26 to CoE with 1470 SAT, 760 math 710 Englishcurious to know what your ec’s were if you don’t mind me asking? I don’t have that manyyo can i ask what your ec’s were? I’m thinking about ED’ing to Cornell Next year. I’ll have a slightly higher score than you 1530 but probably less ec’s. Curious what I could do for ec’sMember of student council since freshman year, member of NHS junior and senior, president of NHS senior year. JV and Varsity soccer all four years, one of the captains the second year on both. Was on the varsity track team a few years and held a job senior and junior year during the winter. I am also a legacy student and live in close proximity to Cornell so I think that helped a bit too.hey thank you for that! I have slightly better scores than you, a 34 on the ACT but my ecs are a little bit less. I have just been doing some coding projects on the side and i’m in NHS right now. Also made international for DECA. I have also leadership in some tutoring firm. What do you think i could do to get my ecs up? I also had a job for 9 months during school( leadership position at a restaurant )I can’t really say sorry, it’s not something I focused on a lot and was one of the things I was worried about when I applied.same exact scenario for me. here’s to hoping i can do enough on my essays to prove my worthThe only thing I can think of is that it doesn’t have to be super official. If I needed stuff to list I might put skiing because even though I’m not on a official team or anything, I still do it for multiple hours every week. Things like that which show your dedicated to something and you have a wide range of interest might be better than nothingfacts, i lead Bible studies weekly with groups from like 5-15 people, could I put that?Accepted CS class of 26 ED and submitted my 1460. Checking with some random stats I believe with a 700 eng and 760 math I was exactly in the 50th percentile for engineering school. Idk enough to say if you should or shouldn’t but it worked for me.I think you should submit your SAT if possible. Also, admissions are by college and not major so you will be comparing against either CAS or COE.

2025 Class Profile:  
[http://irp.dpb.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Profile2021-first-year.pdf](http://irp.dpb.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Profile2021-first-year.pdf)submit.Apparently only around 30 students are accepted throughout all engineering majors for transfersA 1450 is the 25th percentile for the Cornell Class of 2025. Given that you are a sophomore, your past two years of academics will be more relevant than the SAT and its fine not to send that score. Also just looking at your GPA, you should be fine getting into Cornell for ECE.Look for the list of clubs and organizations at Cornell. There's a lot of martial arts clubs, though I'm not sure about specific disciplines.a solid 20% I would sayi think m.eng is meant to prepare you for industry so i don't think it's exactly expected to have a lot of prior outside school experience. but that's just what i sorta gathered from info sessions i did not actually apply to an m.eng.Sometime in late March/early April!Ivy Day has not been decided yet.

https://blog.prepscholar.com/ivy-day-decisionsnah USthen why did u mention Asian Indian?cuz affirmative action screws asians 😂do you HAVE to mention in your Application? I am 10th grade so IDKyes it’s pretty obvious if ur lyingthat sounds racist of US Colleges bitchhhhhI am sorry but I have seen your chat history and... I think you can focus more on yourself rather than..... u get it?LMAO you would fit in just great herewho me?Are you international?Not sure about the others but A&S has a lower admission rate because it's more popular! It has a ton of majors since the focus of the college is so broadYou can see the benefit of applying ED at this link. HumEc acceptance rate is actually around 50% with ED! https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jx54xf/cornell_ed_admit_rates_by_college_using_math/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfYou can submit your music supp if you want, but not mandatory. I guess it depends on your situation. If you want to major in psychology and your essay is about music and the mind, the music supp would support that, for example.

College of human ecology has only 7 majors iirc which makes it less desirable than A&S which offers at least 60 majors. So less major flexibility in college of human ecology. But if you are absolutely sure you want to major in that area, ED to HumEc will boost your acceptance rate a lot. I think there’s a spreadsheet someone made on this subreddit that said ED HumEc acceptance rate was north of 40%?Ok thank you so much!!!Would an ipad pro be enough for an econ major in A&S?No idea. I would still recommend a laptop, since you can do much more.No an ipad will not be enough. Every engineering major needs to take an intro to programming course, and you will need an actual computer for that. Most majors also have specific software that you will need to use on a computer. You can use the computer labs, but it will be massively inconvenient (wasting many hours per week probably). If you are only getting one device, get a laptop not an ipad.while the other person is right that having your own laptop will be handy, there are plenty of ways around this. several libraries on campus have desktop computers with plenty of programs on this that you would never bother getting on your own computer. I never found this massively inconvenient, in fact i typically preferred using the desktops in the libraries because they are way bigger than my laptop screen, and some libraries have two desktops at one station for dual screen, and the engineering library has touch screen desktops. it's a good point that for intro to matlab/python you might like to work on this stuff on your own computer, but what i did when i was working on a spreadsheet for ex, is i would just email it to myself at the end of the day. you could also just get a flash drive. ALSO, you can rent laptops from the library. Last semester my computer was broken so i just kept renting laptops. There's longterm leases for two weeks and also 3 hour renting. Protip: you can check out a 3 hour laptop, and then just renew it every three hours for infinity. there's never so much demand that they ask for the laptop back. and you can ask to renew it like an hour before closing time at the library and that'll make it due the next morning so you can keep it overnight. and you have like an hour or two window after the 3 hours before their system starts sending emails insisting you'll be in trouble if you don't bring it back. But i think you would actually manage just fine with just an ipad, just keep in mind you will need to use cornell computers in some way at some pointYou'll need a GRE score... And GPA boost likely. This is one of the most competitive CS graduate programs.if by an chance someone is actually reading this read, I will like to add one more question. I switched schools after my junior year of high school I went from a private boarding school to a public school and my teachers have assured me that none has ever even applied out side the city from my present high school and that can also be verified that I had to manually enter the name of my school in the application.  Will this negatively affect my application as due to this switch the number of debates and events that I could partake in decreased exponentially as my present high school does not provide any opportunities. Does the admission team reject application from small towns and public schools in favor of students from prestigious institutions in the westI wouldn't worry about Cornell looking down on the fact that you're from a small town and had less achievements/activities/advanced classes than people from cities and prestigious high schools; Cornell takes into consideration the opportunities you actually have available to you, and simply look at how you were able to use the resources around you to the best of your abilities! You might even have a slight advantage because you stand out among students who usually don't reach for such prestigious universities. And since you said you took the best classes you could, and have quite a few unique and impressive achievements, you seem pretty qualified to me!Thanks for the kind words I am actually trying to piggy bank on the uniqueness on my application to get into CornellI wanted to add to my chance me , I also wrote about high in my school we dont really have any particals from physics and chem so I would make artwork which used the principal that were taught to us in class so maybe like optics I creates a glass pieces, when we were taught about light and colloidal substances I made a scene with light pass through  and also a explosion simulation.You need 120 credits to graduate, averaging \~15 credits a semester. You will need to take \~5 classes a semester to grad in 4 years. But, you are always more marketable and ready for a career the more you do, so I wouldn't personally recommend just trying to the minimum. Take advantage of what Cornell can offer you!As poster above said, the bare minimum basic math = 120 credits divided by 8 semesters = 15 credits a semester. If all your classes were 3 units that would be 5 classes per semester.

But it isn't tidy like that. A&S (CAS) requires a language, which could be 4 or 6 credits. Many classes are 4 credits and require 1 or 2 credit labs. And you pretty much have to do the work on your schedule yourself to find the classes that meet the requirements of your major. There are resources like: [https://courses.cornell.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603) for you to read thoroughly. And there is a huge chance you will change your direction during the first two years that Cornell gives you before you declare a major.[deleted]Not sure if it will be mcclintock but the entirety of north campus where freshmen live is uphill lol. I’ve seen people skate around so not impossible but probably easier going to classes then coming back.Nearly no differences in terms of research for undergrads...but if you're interested in getting minors or experiences in engineering-related fields, e.g. BME, BE, etc., CALS would be a better choice.[deleted]GPAs are calculated strange in my district, my 100 point weighted is like a 97Also, this is my mobile alt. My other account is SafeBusy8172, if someone finds that post, lol.Forgot to add that I live in the south.I take them at HS. 
We’re partnered with the local CC so their classes get taught on campus.12th grade I plan on taking:
Semester A:
AP Comp Science A
ENGL 2322 (British Lit I)
GOVT 2305 (Fed Gov)
HUMA 2323 (World Cultures)
SOCI 1301 (Intro to Sociology)
KINE 1304 (Personal/Community Health)

Semester B:
PSYC 2301 (Gen Psychology)
ENGL 2323 (British Lit II)
GOVT 2306 (Texas Gov)
ECON 2301 (Economics)
AP Computer Science B

(My internship will also hopefully be 12th grade, and it is counted as a course (divided into seminar first semester, and mentorship second semester) and is weighted as a 5.)ok, if the classes are taught be a high school teacher at a high school then i don't think Cornell would count them as college credits. Cornell doesn't allow dual enrollment credits from what i understand (ie my high school taught College Chem instead of AP Chem and i didn't get any credit for it at Cornell because my high school chemistry teacher taught it, even though it really was like the same material as Chem 2070 at cornell). If it's a college professor teaching at the high school, that might be ok, but i'd look into Cornell's policies about it (and whatever other colleges you apply to)I had a C in College Algebra for my first semester mostly due to me adjusting to the new scheduling my school had, while balancing 9 classes and seasonal depression.just about the college credit stuff, did you take those classes at a college or were they taught by a high school teacher at your school?Tbh, nobody will give you an accurate probability. But you have decent stats.

Also, you mentioned an exciting topic to talk about in your essay.

One piece of advice spend a lot of time browsing your intended school at Cornell to find the answers to why Cornell?. 
Essays are mattered a lot, so do your best. However, don’t stress over extras. 

Finally, I wish you all the best in your application progress and future endeavors.Thanks. I don’t know if any of this helps or matters, but I’ve been student teaching at my religious school since 8th grade, which is a big commitment. My peer court and gender equality work has been through high school(except for during Covid shutdowns). 

I’m also expected to finish in the top 2 of my class. Whether I’m 1 or 2 depends obviously on the rest of this year.i had about the same extras as you so dont worry too much haha. you seem pretty good to me! like you're aware you're definitely not the most exciting candidate ever but for candidates of your level i feel like ive met ppl at cornell with similar profiles to you. i personally had less honor societies but i did theater my whole middle school/high school and had clear progression imo. but you're applying to hum ec which is a state school (i did cals im from nys too). so i think you have as good of chances as me and i got in (well maybe a little less idk how much cornell tries to reduce the long island/nyc/westchester kids they get). but yeah i dont think you're a 100% shoo in but no reason to despair i wouldnt be surprised at all if you get inJ like list a ton of clubs/organizations/project teams u “plan on joining” and name drop like deadass at least 5 professors whose class u wanna take and whom you’ve “researched” aboutI'd be going for my masters in something computer science and engineering related.Cornell Tech is only for grad programs; the campus is beautiful but the community is fairly small. The main campus has both undergrad and post-grad, both greatI did and they prompted me to reach out to their email. However, they are yet to respond. I didn’t Submit my eligibility questionnaire until like feb 8.I believe emails for HEOP RD came out about 3-4 weeks ago! I would contact their Diversity & Outreach office for more info considering it is time sensitive.I definitely have a lot more stuff for EAS. I do research at my current institution in geodynamics making models that applies CS to geosciences, I tutor in Earth science, was the captain for Earth science in high school Science Olympiad where I won many medals. I'm just worried that Cornell might see my application as trying to "sneak in" to the school since I did apply to my current institution as a CS major before later declaring a Geosciences double major and I have a lot more classes in CS/AMS. I am genuinely interested in studying both though.when you transfer to CAS you come in undecided anyway (for sophomores at least), so i'd assume it's not based on major? Though if you have one major that aligns most closely with your application i'd say do that (though i applied as a gov major with a lot of cs related application materials, so that also can work)Arts and sciences doesn't admit by major and all students enter as undeclared, so applying for a popular/uncommon major will not make it any more difficult/easier to get accepted.Thank you for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it!if you have solid essays then I’d say you have a competitive chanceSounds like you have everything on paper for admission. As long as you have a good rec and good paper, I think you’re gtg.Im not sure you need to provide an sat score fyi https://admissions.cornell.edu/news/cornell-university-will-suspend-actsat-testing-requirement-2022-first-year-applicantsThat’s what I was guessing but it really discourages me from wanting to goPeople just come here to rant. Also it is exam season right now, so everyone is stressed. Do not think that this subreddit is an accurate reflection on people's perspectives.? This links to a Rick Astley You Tube Channeloh my bad, here’s the actual lecture

Also, if you have any advice on how to differentiate this essay from the human ecology one of "How has your decision to apply to the College of Human Ecology been influenced by your related experiences? How will your choice of major impact your goals and plans for the future?" Thanks!Think about it as past, present, and future. What has happened in your past and what have you already accomplished that has led you to your modern aspirations and goals. In other words, “how did something in the past shape my present?” Ive seen students use this to explain their motivations and ‘why’. 

For the present: Why would transferring to Cornell at this very moment play a vital role in your life? Why now? What can Cornell offer you that you can’t find anywhere else? 

For future: care about your legacy. You are joining a community of thousands of Cornellians. How will this help your goals? Where do you see yourself carrying the Cornell name and where will you take your own? 

Idk if that helps, but that’s how I would look at it. :) best of luck!What is your end goal? What do you want to do with your education? That’s the most important question. Why do you want to study law as well as human development? How will you apply those two concepts to further your career? 

Good luck!I'm just curious, but why MechE instead of CS, given you did USACO? But I think you have a very strong application, and probably be admitted, but I'm just a student.Does it make a difference being a Junior versus a Sophomore transfer?im not too sure tbhthe transfer class at dyson is actually huge so the admissions rate is much higher than the regular undergraduate class. imo the most important things to set your application apart is how much you resonate with dyson values / the core mission statement and how you embody that in day to day lifeSo do you think if I wanted to go into finance or banking it would be better to go to dyson or ILR?Dyson for sureDyson is definitely better, but there are many ILR students going into finance as well.

ILR has a higher acceptance rate than Dyson (~18% compared to ~3%)Do you know anything about how easier/harder it is to transfer into one or the other??Dyson is under SC Johnson Business, which is not CALS. Both are generally easier programs than say economics in CAS. ILR is more of a human resources degree, and then you can specialize in econ. Dyson is more of a business degree, where you can also choose to specialize in econ. ILR will land you HR jobs; Dyson will land you more business jobs. Pretty self-explanatory.Thanks. I know Cornell's transfer rates are inflated, but missing this one class has been stressing me out.They look at applications holistically. One class should not make or break your application!1. yes, but it doesn't count much, if at all. parents are considered a "primary" legacy, and have an effect on the applicant, whereas siblings are considered "secondary" and have little to no effect on the applicant.
2. no, deferred applicants will simply be put into the same pool as regular decision applicants and will be treated the same as themThey do have a math placement test for multivariable that you could study for to get credit for it. 
https://math.cornell.edu/apSometimes it is the decision and sometimes people get it off of the waitlist.Did you end up goingGot mine 2 years ago in my rejection letterDon't put your name on a bus. It doesn't work.Ok yea the school responded and said they do thx.Early acceptance letter into SHACongrats!First year! Senior in HS rn. Thanks!!!nope but definitely catered towards the CALS mission statement. I think I personally wrote abt my then-interest in medicine and math but I lowkey knew I wanted to do ds/finance lolHow do you do ds/finance in CALS? Do you double major or minor with Dyson?thank you! That's what I thought but should I have some bio/ag-related extracurricularar to relate to the college (which I don't)?No clue. Write about your own interests. Don't make up stuff that you aren't truly passionate about.In the Why essay for CALS, should I focus on Stats or should I also mention biology/medicine-related experience or thoughts?Yeah, I knew that about the legacy, and that’s a shame about APUSH, but at least they’ll still see I did well on the exam. Thanks!Thank you! I’m glad to know that they’re test blind in this scenario. My school requires a certain passing score for the ACT/SAT so I’m working towards that though unfortunately 💔CS is definitely hard at GT but it’s not impossible. I would personally recommend Tech even as a current Cornell student because it’s kind of easier tbh than double majoring at Cornell.
Source: CALS transfer from TechNot really. Legacy helps but it’s not huge. I would really explore your passions In your essay, I’d be happy to read it over if it helps but I’m just a freshmen in ILR

Tbh idk how many older students they take but I wouldn’t worry about legacy too much. Plenty of non legacy students get admitted, especially to ilr. 

Good luck!I'm transferring from a small community college in rural Virginia. Surprised so many credits would transfer over. Nobody in my family holds a college degree. Will these factors hurt my chances? I hear legacy students have the highest chance of admission..SO COOL OF YOU :OI'm not sure about exact numbers but I know it would definitely be easier. About 10% of Cornell is international but only ~40 internationals are accepted with aid every year, so the large majority are not on aid.Thank you so much for the help!Thank you for the reply! I was worried because some people say I need to halve the general acceptance rate to get the acceptance rate for international student. Would it be that hard for international students not requiring financial aid or will it be slightly less if I don't ask for the financial aid?Pretty good, the weather is crazy tho 😅Thank You for your response! I am happy to see you again here. How are you liking Cornell?Ugh I’ve been searching for this info! Thank you!Thank you so much!Thank you so much for replying! Cornell still seems a bit scary but you make it seem way more doable. I'll continue considering it.Thank you! I applied ED as an incoming freshman.Ok, thanks so much :)If you are in Dyson, you can request to double in a CALS major at any time [1]. If you are in CALS, you must request to double in AEM (Dyson) only during your freshman or sophomore year, and is not allowed for transfer students [2].

[1]
https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/major-changes-and-double-major

[2] https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/double-major/Is it harder for a CAS student to get approval for a double major in AEM than for a CALS student?~~I would assume so given this notice:~~

~~"Note: While meeting or exceeding the above criteria will increase your competitiveness, it does not ensure approval to double major in AEM."~~

EDIT: I completely misread your question. If you are in CAS, you will probably not be allowed to double major in AEM since they are in different colleges (and concurrent degree is no longer available).

Dyson website: "Students with another major in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) may apply to double major in Applied Economics and Management (AEM)"

CAS website: "If you decide to add another major, it must be within the College of Arts & Sciences"In that sense, do CALS and DYSON count as the "same college" that one can double major in?aightNo, but if you search the subreddit for "internal transfer" you will find many posts on the topic.I know someone who did this, I believe it took them 5 years to graduate instead of the usual 4. I can't remember if it was because they ended up double majoring in chem and cheme or if cheme requirements took an extra year to finish. Most cheme classes are offered fall only or spring only so the latter seems most likely.cool, thanks againWow, thanks for the info. Merry Christmas!Thanks! Do you know anyone who has done this?Ok yeah i will, but also i just felt like if i indicated interest on my app they might take that into consideration and maybe it would be a positiveThanks so much! I took a deeper look at the degree requirements and decided to do statistical scienceDefinitely take precalc this summer, try your local community college maybe and check with your counselor if they would accept that. If your school offers calculus and you don't take I'm pretty sure it puts you at a very big disadvantage.Sorry about the confusion as of now I am a junior in high school, and as for calculus I'm taking pre calculus next year since I started with algebra 1 and not geometry in my freshmen year. Overall I will have 4 years of math but it wouldn't include calculus(my school offers it I just can't take it since I need pre calc), although I have been looking into ways that I can speed it up via a summer course to take calculus in my senior year.yeah i think cornell in washington is a big thing for gov majorsTypically, dual enrollment refers to college courses taken to satisfy high school requirements. If you took these classes at the same time as high school but not for graduation, they may be eligible for credit (given some other criteria are met).

Here is the CALS policy: https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/non-cornell-credit/college-credit-earned-while-high-school

(Similar policies exist for all colleges at Cornell)Thank youI thiught they did, but at half the creditYup!In the upload portal, there is a spot for Optional Supplemental Material. Should I submit it there?hey! let me know if you get in!!

|-|-|-|-|Hello!

Will do! Good luck to you too! :Dhey! did you get in?Hello!

I unfortunately got rejected, but will be applying to transfer next year for sure. 😭😭Thank you! :)Thank you!“When” I get in. Haha—thanks for the positivity!I know transferring is hard, especially for A&STransfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.ohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set upWhat does TO mean???When did you get that? I believe we haven’t received one yet.huh this is a joke right idkHaha thanks:( not a jokesorry igyea but im an indian maleProbably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.Hi, I'm asking for a friend cause she's not on Reddit, but do these materials include Cornell's Supplement?Ask what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.Hi!! I just got in too but I was not expecting to get in. I’m the opposite, I love management and food service. I was wondering if I could ask u a couple of questions about the environment and course rigor? I have no idea how I got accepted I’m such a an average student hahaWho are you friends with!? Omg I feel like I got the least sleep in my life during undergrad - in the best way.ThanksGood enough to certainly applyAnything to improve?Also, will USESO be impressive? I was a finalistIt is discernable that your spike aligns with neuroscience more than humanities. Again, your chances very much depend on the prestige of all your activities. Where were those research papers published? What professors did you work with? What organisations recognize your app? That kind of stuff can make the difference between Stanford and Georgia TechHmm not super sure but I'd say pretty selective! There are like 35 other kids with me. But again, it’s a stem thing and I wanna do a more humanities major so idrk. What are you thoughts about my overall chances tho?Ah thanks, didn't know! Bowers CIS can be confusing.^^this but to your 2nd point stat/btry majors are now CIS students so same priority enrollment as info/csfair. i feel like infosci and biometry are similar enough majors in terms of learning outcomes, and if you have already fulfilled most of the requirements then you'll have more room in your schedule to take bio classes - good luck!The basic stats class at my college is equivalent to an AP Stats class where all the content is outdated and taught wrong. I like statistics, but I don't want to take a class where all the principles are irrelevant to classes further down the line if that makes senseFor the three course in science, i have a general studies in science 10, chem 12, and chem ap but I’m not sure if that’ll count for the courses required.I very much doubt you would have any issues thereOh thanks! I’m just wondering in terms of applications if I’m applying to dyson and possibly double majoring in global development, if not having any biology courses will hurt me.Thanks for sharing, that's definitely useful info.  Are you a CS major btw?Yes, you can!thank you!!thank you! the research is relating to public health do you know if this also applies to cornell's grad schools? can you research with a cornell grad school faculty as an undergrad?I would ignore this conception of pure "acceptance rate." ILR is a specialized college and as with any specialty school, you will have less overall applications where more of the candidates' profiles are aligned with that specialty. You will notice from 2021 admissions statistics that ILR has an extremely high yield (number entering vs number accepted).

|College|Applied|Accepted|Entering|Rate|Yield|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CAS**|30,670|2,191|1,285|7.14%|58.6%|
|**CALS**|6,679|820|604|12.3%|73.7%|
|**ILR**|1,304|224|168|17.2%|75.0%|Another major you might want to consider is ORIE in the college of engineering (maybe combined with a CS minor) since ORIE has a lot of the stats/data science/machine learning classes as well classes that focus on applications in business and finance specifically.Thanks! 

ILR acceptance rate is higher than CAS and CALS and it had business courses that's why I was exploring that.Thanks for replying, I submitted my interview essay and believe my portfolio is good but I know I’ll be competing against an extremely talented array of students and haven’t been able to get feedback on my portfolio from someone with experience to determine how it compares to other students. Being February, I’m in that limbo of not having the stress of submitting applications but also not having the relief of knowing if I got in anywhere. Thank you for your advice and kind words, where I get in for undergrad isn’t an end-all-be-all (but fingers crossed for Cornell :)yo can i ask what your ec’s were? I’m thinking about ED’ing to Cornell Next year. I’ll have a slightly higher score than you 1530 but probably less ec’s. Curious what I could do for ec’sLiterally exactly the same. CS class of 26 to CoE with 1470 SAT, 760 math 710 EnglishMember of student council since freshman year, member of NHS junior and senior, president of NHS senior year. JV and Varsity soccer all four years, one of the captains the second year on both. Was on the varsity track team a few years and held a job senior and junior year during the winter. I am also a legacy student and live in close proximity to Cornell so I think that helped a bit too.hey thank you for that! I have slightly better scores than you, a 34 on the ACT but my ecs are a little bit less. I have just been doing some coding projects on the side and i’m in NHS right now. Also made international for DECA. I have also leadership in some tutoring firm. What do you think i could do to get my ecs up? I also had a job for 9 months during school( leadership position at a restaurant )I can’t really say sorry, it’s not something I focused on a lot and was one of the things I was worried about when I applied.same exact scenario for me. here’s to hoping i can do enough on my essays to prove my worthThe only thing I can think of is that it doesn’t have to be super official. If I needed stuff to list I might put skiing because even though I’m not on a official team or anything, I still do it for multiple hours every week. Things like that which show your dedicated to something and you have a wide range of interest might be better than nothingfacts, i lead Bible studies weekly with groups from like 5-15 people, could I put that?curious to know what your ec’s were if you don’t mind me asking? I don’t have that manyApparently only around 30 students are accepted throughout all engineering majors for transfersthen why did u mention Asian Indian?cuz affirmative action screws asians 😂do you HAVE to mention in your Application? I am 10th grade so IDKyes it’s pretty obvious if ur lyingthat sounds racist of US Colleges bitchhhhhI am sorry but I have seen your chat history and... I think you can focus more on yourself rather than..... u get it?LMAO you would fit in just great herewho me?nah USYou can see the benefit of applying ED at this link. HumEc acceptance rate is actually around 50% with ED! https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jx54xf/cornell_ed_admit_rates_by_college_using_math/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfOk thank you so much!!!No idea. I would still recommend a laptop, since you can do much more.Would an ipad pro be enough for an econ major in A&S?I wouldn't worry about Cornell looking down on the fact that you're from a small town and had less achievements/activities/advanced classes than people from cities and prestigious high schools; Cornell takes into consideration the opportunities you actually have available to you, and simply look at how you were able to use the resources around you to the best of your abilities! You might even have a slight advantage because you stand out among students who usually don't reach for such prestigious universities. And since you said you took the best classes you could, and have quite a few unique and impressive achievements, you seem pretty qualified to me!Thanks for the kind words I am actually trying to piggy bank on the uniqueness on my application to get into Cornellif by an chance someone is actually reading this read, I will like to add one more question. I switched schools after my junior year of high school I went from a private boarding school to a public school and my teachers have assured me that none has ever even applied out side the city from my present high school and that can also be verified that I had to manually enter the name of my school in the application.  Will this negatively affect my application as due to this switch the number of debates and events that I could partake in decreased exponentially as my present high school does not provide any opportunities. Does the admission team reject application from small towns and public schools in favor of students from prestigious institutions in the westAs poster above said, the bare minimum basic math = 120 credits divided by 8 semesters = 15 credits a semester. If all your classes were 3 units that would be 5 classes per semester.

But it isn't tidy like that. A&S (CAS) requires a language, which could be 4 or 6 credits. Many classes are 4 credits and require 1 or 2 credit labs. And you pretty much have to do the work on your schedule yourself to find the classes that meet the requirements of your major. There are resources like: [https://courses.cornell.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603) for you to read thoroughly. And there is a huge chance you will change your direction during the first two years that Cornell gives you before you declare a major.GPAs are calculated strange in my district, my 100 point weighted is like a 97[deleted]ok, if the classes are taught be a high school teacher at a high school then i don't think Cornell would count them as college credits. Cornell doesn't allow dual enrollment credits from what i understand (ie my high school taught College Chem instead of AP Chem and i didn't get any credit for it at Cornell because my high school chemistry teacher taught it, even though it really was like the same material as Chem 2070 at cornell). If it's a college professor teaching at the high school, that might be ok, but i'd look into Cornell's policies about it (and whatever other colleges you apply to)I take them at HS. 
We’re partnered with the local CC so their classes get taught on campus.I had a C in College Algebra for my first semester mostly due to me adjusting to the new scheduling my school had, while balancing 9 classes and seasonal depression.12th grade I plan on taking:
Semester A:
AP Comp Science A
ENGL 2322 (British Lit I)
GOVT 2305 (Fed Gov)
HUMA 2323 (World Cultures)
SOCI 1301 (Intro to Sociology)
KINE 1304 (Personal/Community Health)

Semester B:
PSYC 2301 (Gen Psychology)
ENGL 2323 (British Lit II)
GOVT 2306 (Texas Gov)
ECON 2301 (Economics)
AP Computer Science B

(My internship will also hopefully be 12th grade, and it is counted as a course (divided into seminar first semester, and mentorship second semester) and is weighted as a 5.)Thanks. I don’t know if any of this helps or matters, but I’ve been student teaching at my religious school since 8th grade, which is a big commitment. My peer court and gender equality work has been through high school(except for during Covid shutdowns). 

I’m also expected to finish in the top 2 of my class. Whether I’m 1 or 2 depends obviously on the rest of this year.I'd be going for my masters in something computer science and engineering related.I did and they prompted me to reach out to their email. However, they are yet to respond. I didn’t Submit my eligibility questionnaire until like feb 8.I definitely have a lot more stuff for EAS. I do research at my current institution in geodynamics making models that applies CS to geosciences, I tutor in Earth science, was the captain for Earth science in high school Science Olympiad where I won many medals. I'm just worried that Cornell might see my application as trying to "sneak in" to the school since I did apply to my current institution as a CS major before later declaring a Geosciences double major and I have a lot more classes in CS/AMS. I am genuinely interested in studying both though.Thank you for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it!That’s what I was guessing but it really discourages me from wanting to gooh my bad, here’s the actual lecture

~~"Note: While meeting or exceeding the above criteria will increase your competitiveness, it does not ensure approval to double major in AEM."~~

EDIT: I completely misread your question. If you are in CAS, you will probably not be allowed to double major in AEM since they are in different colleges (and concurrent degree is no longer available).

Dyson website: "Students with another major in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) may apply to double major in Applied Economics and Management (AEM)"

CAS website: "If you decide to add another major, it must be within the College of Arts & Sciences"If you are in Dyson, you can request to double in a CALS major at any time [1]. If you are in CALS, you must request to double in AEM (Dyson) only during your freshman or sophomore year, and is not allowed for transfer students [2].

[2] https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/double-major/cool, thanks againNo, but if you search the subreddit for "internal transfer" you will find many posts on the topic.Wow, thanks for the info. Merry Christmas!I know someone who did this, I believe it took them 5 years to graduate instead of the usual 4. I can't remember if it was because they ended up double majoring in chem and cheme or if cheme requirements took an extra year to finish. Most cheme classes are offered fall only or spring only so the latter seems most likely.Definitely take precalc this summer, try your local community college maybe and check with your counselor if they would accept that. If your school offers calculus and you don't take I'm pretty sure it puts you at a very big disadvantage.Thank youTypically, dual enrollment refers to college courses taken to satisfy high school requirements. If you took these classes at the same time as high school but not for graduation, they may be eligible for credit (given some other criteria are met).

Here is the CALS policy: https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/non-cornell-credit/college-credit-earned-while-high-school

|-|-|-|-|Hello!

Will do! Good luck to you too! :Dhey! did you get in?Hello!

I unfortunately got rejected, but will be applying to transfer next year for sure. 😭😭hey! let me know if you get in!!

RemindMe! 25 daysohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set upTransfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.Probably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.Ask what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.Anything to improve?Also, will USESO be impressive? I was a finalistIt is discernable that your spike aligns with neuroscience more than humanities. Again, your chances very much depend on the prestige of all your activities. Where were those research papers published? What professors did you work with? What organisations recognize your app? That kind of stuff can make the difference between Stanford and Georgia TechGood enough to certainly applyAh thanks, didn't know! Bowers CIS can be confusing.fair. i feel like infosci and biometry are similar enough majors in terms of learning outcomes, and if you have already fulfilled most of the requirements then you'll have more room in your schedule to take bio classes - good luck!I very much doubt you would have any issues therethank you!!Yes, you can!I would ignore this conception of pure "acceptance rate." ILR is a specialized college and as with any specialty school, you will have less overall applications where more of the candidates' profiles are aligned with that specialty. You will notice from 2021 admissions statistics that ILR has an extremely high yield (number entering vs number accepted).

|College|Applied|Accepted|Entering|Rate|Yield|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CAS**|30,670|2,191|1,285|7.14%|58.6%|
|**CALS**|6,679|820|604|12.3%|73.7%|
|**ILR**|1,304|224|168|17.2%|75.0%|Another major you might want to consider is ORIE in the college of engineering (maybe combined with a CS minor) since ORIE has a lot of the stats/data science/machine learning classes as well classes that focus on applications in business and finance specifically.yo can i ask what your ec’s were? I’m thinking about ED’ing to Cornell Next year. I’ll have a slightly higher score than you 1530 but probably less ec’s. Curious what I could do for ec’shey thank you for that! I have slightly better scores than you, a 34 on the ACT but my ecs are a little bit less. I have just been doing some coding projects on the side and i’m in NHS right now. Also made international for DECA. I have also leadership in some tutoring firm. What do you think i could do to get my ecs up? I also had a job for 9 months during school( leadership position at a restaurant )I can’t really say sorry, it’s not something I focused on a lot and was one of the things I was worried about when I applied.same exact scenario for me. here’s to hoping i can do enough on my essays to prove my worthThe only thing I can think of is that it doesn’t have to be super official. If I needed stuff to list I might put skiing because even though I’m not on a official team or anything, I still do it for multiple hours every week. Things like that which show your dedicated to something and you have a wide range of interest might be better than nothingfacts, i lead Bible studies weekly with groups from like 5-15 people, could I put that?Member of student council since freshman year, member of NHS junior and senior, president of NHS senior year. JV and Varsity soccer all four years, one of the captains the second year on both. Was on the varsity track team a few years and held a job senior and junior year during the winter. I am also a legacy student and live in close proximity to Cornell so I think that helped a bit too.cuz affirmative action screws asians 😂do you HAVE to mention in your Application? I am 10th grade so IDKyes it’s pretty obvious if ur lyingthat sounds racist of US Colleges bitchhhhhI am sorry but I have seen your chat history and... I think you can focus more on yourself rather than..... u get it?LMAO you would fit in just great herewho me?then why did u mention Asian Indian?No idea. I would still recommend a laptop, since you can do much more.Thanks for the kind words I am actually trying to piggy bank on the uniqueness on my application to get into CornellI wouldn't worry about Cornell looking down on the fact that you're from a small town and had less achievements/activities/advanced classes than people from cities and prestigious high schools; Cornell takes into consideration the opportunities you actually have available to you, and simply look at how you were able to use the resources around you to the best of your abilities! You might even have a slight advantage because you stand out among students who usually don't reach for such prestigious universities. And since you said you took the best classes you could, and have quite a few unique and impressive achievements, you seem pretty qualified to me!GPAs are calculated strange in my district, my 100 point weighted is like a 97ok, if the classes are taught be a high school teacher at a high school then i don't think Cornell would count them as college credits. Cornell doesn't allow dual enrollment credits from what i understand (ie my high school taught College Chem instead of AP Chem and i didn't get any credit for it at Cornell because my high school chemistry teacher taught it, even though it really was like the same material as Chem 2070 at cornell). If it's a college professor teaching at the high school, that might be ok, but i'd look into Cornell's policies about it (and whatever other colleges you apply to)I had a C in College Algebra for my first semester mostly due to me adjusting to the new scheduling my school had, while balancing 9 classes and seasonal depression.Thank you - glad its real & not that you were making some kind of 80’s music reference😂yeah man for sure, you might like this too

I have received so many kind words and very helpful legal advice. As much as I have felt this person has ruined my life, I am more than a victim and they will absolutely get what’s coming to them. Thank you all, again. It means so much to meFirstly: I am so sorry that you were harmed by this individual. Please don't be afraid or ashamed to seek help from Cornell Health or use [this link](https://titleix.cornell.edu/reporting/) to find resources that can help you.

As a moderator of this subreddit, I understand why you might want to dox this person. We've recently hit 43k subscribers, giving any post you make a wide reach. However, doxxing this person on r/Cornell unfortunately not work. Here are the reasons why:

1) Reddit does not allow doxxing. [Please refer to this post for more information.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) Doing so could see you banned from Reddit entirely, which is an action taken by Reddit admins and is not something we have control over.

2) It goes against r/Cornell policy. Because of previous issues with doxxing, we have historically prohibited direct references (names, email addresses, etc.) to non-public individuals on the subreddit. If the person in question is a public individual (ex. a professor, an administrator, a high-profile person), that is another story.

3) Any legal action you may decide to take could be hindered by releasing the person's information. I won't pretend to be a law student, but it's common knowledge not to reveal sensitive information online because it can jeopardize the case you are potentially trying to build. You want to give yourself the best shot at obtaining some form of justice. Of course, this assumes that you're thinking about reporting the crime and are able to do so. If you're not or you can't, I understand. Regardless, the previous points apply.

I have seen other individuals start awareness campaigns on Instagram, for example. If you're comfortable with sharing some details there, that may be something you can look into. I personally know many of my friends would be happy to help pass the information along. I'm very sorry we cannot be of more assistance on r/Cornell. No matter what you choose to do, you have our support.If someone assaulted you report them to the police.  Straight out.  Not sure of Cornell, new here, but at most universities (and likely here) a reported assault will be/stay internal.  Schools do not like their reputations to be hit by crime stats, so they will not pass the report on to the local police.  You have to report to the local authorities and if they say report to cornell (if it happened on campus) insist that you want to report locally.  

 As someone else said, the official report can then be released.  If this person is financially powerful (rich parents) and you are not, they could make your life miserable if you accuse them of something without it having been documented.  

I am sorry you had this happen to you.  They need to held accountable for their actions against you, to warn others about them, and so there is a record.If OP has any intentions of pursuing this criminally, then doxxing the assailant would likely harm OP's case. There's a reason you so frequently hear large companies or famous individuals say something to the tune of "We won't comment on pending litigation" when asked about an upcoming case they're involved in.

The other risk to OP is that if the person getting doxxed suffers financial loss (rescinded job offer, etc.) because of it, *and* if there's no hard evidence to support OP's claims, then they could sue OP for defamation and claim that everything OP says is a lie. Realistically, between college students, this won't happen... so it's not a particularly probable risk. But the possibility is there.

The benefit of doxxing them, besides retaliation, is warning other students and potentially preventing more future victims. That's a pretty significant upside.Knee jerk I'd say yes. But then, if I was in your shoes, I'd start doing the calculations: If I dox them, they may see fit to dox me too. And, what will doxxing them achieve? And... can/will they do worse?

If you pressed charges in a criminal sense, then post the arrest blotter. If sent through Cornell's system, it's still considered a private matter.

Let's be clear, I have 0 concern for the student who assaulted you, I do however have concern for you.No. Go to the police if you were assaulted. 

Also, have you considered that the consequences of doing this (especially after inquiring about doing it online) could implicate you in all kinds of legal trouble? What if someone were to use that information to target their family and harass them too? What if they or their family/friends retaliate?

I don't know what happened to you but its better to do things the right way. Go and file a report as soon as possible with the evidence and information you have or go straight to local PD.

https://scl.cornell.edu/report-incidentTemporarily feeling better about yourself <<<<< long term solution

What is the benefit you gain by doxxing? If you do dox, you lose the legal upper hand you currently have. Your assault may be difficult to prove in court, if you dox them that's not really arguable.I’m very sorry that this happened — I can only imagine how terrible this must feel. I hope that you’re able to find sympathy and peace, and if there’s anything we (the members of r/Cornell) can do for you, don’t hesitate to let us know. We’re here for you.


You should call the police immediately, and file a formal police report. There are advocacy hotlines you can call, as well as Cornell’s Title IX office. They take these things very seriously. 


While I most definitely don’t have any sympathy for those who assault, I don’t see what there is to gain by doxxing him here. It’s fine by me if you do it, of course, but you’re risking a ban from Reddit/this sub and other potential unforeseen consequences if he decides to pursue some type of action (as messed up as that would be).No, instead report them to the authoritiesIf by dox you mean publicly revealing their name, then maybe.  Depends on the situation but I’d strongly consider other options first.

If dox means giving out their address or other personal info then don’t do itI want to say YES but be careful in terms of your physical being and the law.Do it. At Starbucks we have a customer who was outed as a rapist but corporate would not let us ban him. So we had to serve them over and over, he even came in yesterday.

Someone who assaulted you will assault someone else. I understand it is scary and a lot of people here have money to shut people up but fuck them. 

I'm sorry that happened to youNo

Dont lose your legal standing for some temporary strike-back. Take that fuck to courtU ok? Why are you personally trying to insult me instead of adding to the discussion?You assaulted me.

Report to the police and go from there. Not at Cornell but see if the university a policy to remove them from the class.Go to authorities. You could be liable for severe civil penalties otherwise.This is terrible advice and will land OP in legal trouble. Vigilante justice is NEVER the correct first answer.Yes. Make his name known and confront him with a group of people if you can. The police will not help you nor will Cornell, fuck opening a case and pursue collective justice instead.If OP has any intentions of pursuing this criminally, then doxxing the assailant would likely harm OP's case. There's a reason you so frequently hear large companies or famous individuals say something to the tune of "We won't comment on pending litigation" when asked about an upcoming case they're involved in.

The other risk to OP is that if the person getting doxxed suffers financial loss (rescinded job offer, etc.) because of it, *and* if there's no hard evidence to support OP's claims, then they could sue OP for defamation and claim that everything OP says is a lie. Realistically, between college students, this won't happen... so it's not a particularly probable risk. But the possibility is there.

The benefit of doxxing them, besides retaliation, is warning other students and potentially preventing more future victims. That's a pretty significant upside.Temporarily feeling better about yourself <<<<< long term solution

What is the benefit you gain by doxxing? If you do dox, you lose the legal upper hand you currently have. Your assault may be difficult to prove in court, if you dox them that's not really arguable.[removed]Your post has been deemed inappropriate for this subreddit.

I'm a rising senior at Cornell who's staying on campus over the summer. I was homeschooled throughout high school and mostly focused on schoolwork my first three years, but now I'm interested in getting into team sports like basketball/tennis/etc. because it seems like fun. 

My problem is I've literally never played any of them before, so I need some way to get good enough where I'm at least capable of playing with other people. (None of my friends play, so I can't ask them for help.)

I am a '26 looking to buy my winter clothes for ithaca. I am currently trying to choose what socks to get as I've heard its rly important to have thick warm socks. For reference in terms of shoes, I am currently deciding between a more insulated LL bean duck boot and a less insulated timberland boot.

I was wondering if you guys had any recs for socks to help me survive the ithaca winter as I come from a warm climate lol

Thanks :)I definitely agree with this. My family stressed about winter and over bought gloves and hats. As long as you make use of the buses and plan to not be outside too often, you only need to buy a good coat.Which coat? How many layers do you wear?With a Canada Goose, I only wear the coat and a tshirt and find this very comfortable.Tbh I'm fine with a Columbia omni-heat jacket and a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath. Columbia has pretty good sales online or at an outlet mall if you can get to one. If it's extra chilly/windy I'll also wear a sweatshirt. I'll also recommend layering pants if it's windy. Fleece-lined leggings or sweatpants are godsends. Having lived through many upstate NY and New England winters, the cold isn't too bad. It's the wind that really sucks.Honestly, people kinda over hype Ithaca winters. I wore normal socks 99% of the time, and I never lost any digits or anything. I’d just get a couple pairs of wool socks to wear on really cold days.this was the brand recommended when my pe class went ice climbing. darn tough socks are wool and high quality -- wool is known to be really good insulators and keep you warm when cold and cool when warm.I would say darn tough socks work in summer and winter bothVermonter here, your boots are 10x more important for keeping your feet warm compared to socks. 

As long as you don’t wear crocs and run into a pile of snow you should be fine.

Maybe wear two pairs of regular socks if you’re particularly sensitive to the cold.Don't squish your feet is rule number one. No circulation= extra cold feet. Get boots a little larger than normal shoes and wear a light to medium sock of wool or wool poly blend, you'll be fine. You aren't likely outside for long stretches so honestly if you have footwear that keeps your feet dry that is more important than warmth per se. Good waterproof boots or shoes with treads that will allow you to walk on ice or snow will be the best. Socks matter much less as long as you have socks that cover your ankles.

If you want specific sock recommendations for winter darn tough and smart wool are fabulous. I use them for super cold days or when I need to be outside more than 20 min at a stretch.As a minnesotan, I can say Ithaca winters are nothing crazy. I'd just wear 2 pairs of socks when it's cold and get a snow boot of your choice.Wool socksLol I don’t know a single person who wears winter socks. Just wear ur normal socks dude you’ll be fineAny wool socks should do, hiking ones can be multi purpose tooDon’t worry so much about your socks. Worry about your boots.Echoing some other comments, I've personally found that good shoes make more of a difference than good socks.

Socks matter mostly in situations where snow or cold rain gets into your shoes somehow. **If you're regularly getting your socks wet while wearing shoes, then yes, you want to pick your socks carefully**\--for instance, pick wool socks rather than cotton ones (as a saying goes among winter hikers and mountain climbers, "cotton kills") and there's a bunch more nuanced advice to be found in this regard.

But then again, **if you're regularly getting your socks wet while wearing shoes, then you're likely doing something wrong.** Get a good pair of insulated, waterproof or water resistant shoes. If there's a lot of snow to the point where it's falling down into your shoes, around your ankles (and this only happens 3x or 4x a winter) then get winter pants that you can stretch over the top inch or two of your shoes to avoid that. And now that your feet are no longer getting wet, your socks really don't matter that much for regular use. As long as you're not trying to camp outdoors, hike a mountain, etc., anything decently thick will do.Which coat?

This store is high-volume and has nothing to do with revenue/customers. Not only that, but management has avoided saying whether the workers (the ones that unionized!) will be relocated to a different location. Of course, they did this when students are gone for the summer so not many students can physically help protest, but please help this gain traction.

Losing revenue is much more meaningful than a few mean comments on their twitter.I'm pretty sure they're going to bet on the likelihood that people will cave the boycott and not really follow through with what they they say; and even assuming they did,  it wouldn't be enough harm their business since they'd probably not see a huge effect in their numbers in the long run. The best case scenario might be to convince the university from not selling Starbucks products all over campus, but it's likely not to happen.The venn diagram of girls who love faux social activism and girls who drink starbucks is a circle. Good luck with thatIf theyre shutting down what will boycotting it doPeople won’t follow through. They have too long been conditioned to take what these corporate entities give them without complaint and besides  how will they ever live without their grande mocha iced lattes??Hey some of us are at home tea drinkers! Don't lump us in with the Starbucks mobHow can we help?Particularly when there are some national award winning local roasters right here in Ithaca that cornell can sell insteadMannible serves (at least last time I was there) coffee from Gimmee!  My regular daily coffee is usually from Copper Horse.  The other one I often have is from Wegmans.I guarauntee you 90% of students could not give the slightest fuck. You may see your cause as noble, but the world runs on money and satisfaction, not moral righteousness.starbucks coffee is also worse than peets and copper horse by a lot. and copper horse is localIt closed, now the corp that runs the dining halls has that space and it sucks.Various outlets on the Cornell campus serve Starbucks coffee. Perhaps it’s time a message was sent by the students that they won’t tolerate their university supporting anti-labor corporations.I’m just waiting for all of the fucks from Dyson to come in chat to defend their corporate overlords 🍿all the Ithaca stores are closing at 2 for the summer but the store shutting down is unrelatedWait I just came to green street for the bus and saw Starbucks getting closed by 2pm today. Thought it was because students left and they have less customers now, but it’s actually union busting? This is crazy. Not gonna buy from them until workers are getting their basic needs met.

Edit: I mixed up the two stores. Hope the downtown store stay intact.Why is it illegal to close the store?I posted earlier that this is exactly what would happen. They would close the store, wait several years and reopen it.Fuck SBUX

To all the workers getting laid off bc of these corporate pussies:

I see in the you the strongest and smartest people who've ever lived. I see all this potential and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation making coffee, waiting tables, slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. 

We're the middle children of the history man, no purpose or place. We have no Great war, no Great depression - our great war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives.Serious question: do Starbucks have grease traps?  I thought their menu was mostly already prepped food.Covid has been around for 2 years and this is not the first summer during covid. Last summer the store did not shut down and the summer before the store did not shut down, so what makes this one different?mans is dick-riding so hard like howard schultz himself is gonna hand him a job 💀Unclear, I vaguely remember that It was actually a grease trap from the previous occupiers of the property, or perhaps was next door and grease leaked through the wall. Those were details that floated around when the employees were discussing unionizing.the high speed (combi) ovens they use to warm sandwiches are notorious for producing lots of grease.my point is surrounding compounding issues. that covid has been impacting the revenue for longer than just this spring semester only goes to evidence the potential instability of income. That store could even be breaking even, but has value in maintaining the Starbucks name at a popular location amongst younger patrons (who will presumably go on to make enough money to sustain regular coffee purchases down the road)... it could even run at a slight deficit. But now with the strike thrown into the mix and potential company perception that the union cant really be worked with at an acceptable level, they bail.

my only point is that their goal is to make money, not to spite random workers in Ithaca. They would only shut down an operation if their cost/benefit analysis indicated that it was an appropriate decision going forward given the environment that particular property rests in.dunno why my expressing a slightly controversial opinion in a relatively cordial manner invites comments like this. If you want to be rude, be rude... but understand that viewpoints like mine are like those that exist in the majority of people, that one (presumably you) who supports the unionized employees of Starbucks might want to reach.

People who support them are fewer in number, and this movement will only get steam by reaching out and showing a reason to care. If your goal is to disparage those who earnestly respond to an issue in a with no indication of disrespect, you're doing a disservice to those you probably support.Ah, ok... Previous occupant's grease trap makes sense.

A latte and onion rings would be...odd.Homie your vague remembrance could have been helped by a [quick Reddit search](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/u53p1x/collegetown_starbucks_is_on_strike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or by supporting the Starbucks workers when they spoke on campus, where the store manager described the grease trap in such vivid detail that they cut themself off because they grossed out the crowd ([link to recording](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/events/moment-movement-starbucks-and-slow-drip-starting-union)). 
Bottom line, it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that you, an outsider, assume you have better view of the situation than the workers who are in the store every day. Sbucks union busting is notorious and highly documented, if you watch the workers talk in the above link. Get off your high and mighty stool and actually listen to what the workers are saying, even if you’re not going to support.What about the unionized Starbucks popping up around the country? You don’t think that anti-union Starbucks would shut down a location to make an example? Regardless, with the margins that Starbucks makes on those drinks (50 cents for a little bit of oat milk…) and the volume of orders that they get from Cornell students in Ctown, even with a union there is no way that that Starbucks is going under. I think you lack a sense of the bigger picture here. There are definitely reasons that Starbucks would shut down beyond a pure cost benefit analysisOh my gosh that was aggressive.

Nowhere have I assumed to have a better view of the situation, in fact all of my language is built around not knowing various details and being aware of the existence of unknown unknowns. I'm speaking to this specifically BECAUSE I'm an outsider with no feelings one way or the other on the issue of this starbucks. Unfortunately the camp that i fall into is one thay the vast majority of students on campus do as well... and admonishing me(or anybody else like me) for expressing what I think and feel, as well as my various apprehensions is the last thing that is going to get anybody any support.

There is no high horse commentary... just a desire for a more complete approach to the issue beyond just "they don't fix grease trap, we strike, they shut the store down". This is not something that really anybody can form an opinion on in a vacuum, and asking people to rise up based on that narrative alone isn't in good faith.I don't know anything about Starbucks unions popping up around the country. I don't know Starbucks's position on unions. 

What I do know is that I (hopefully) am a reasonable person who falls into an educated group of people, who has a particular outlook on things. That outlook is a similar one to many: detached from this problem. Im merely speaking to what i would expect, just like many others would expect as well, as somebody who does not have a lot of impetus to be informed.

I'm a molecular biology major, I don't follow this. This issue does not fit into my sphere of interest of things that I would pursue independently... and I'm not the only one who is like this. Thus if I express that a particular issue doesn't appear intuitive, the goal shouldn't be to talk me down, but perhaps inform me or onlookers. 

Aside from all of that, nothing I've said has actually been refuted. The closest thing to refuting what I've said is your statement regarding margins that Starbucks makes x y and z, vs what they pay.... but we don't know that do we? We done have the numbers... if we do that would be an important thing to share. Everything that I've been told so far revolves around what people think happens, and what somebody said something looks like.  So a reasonable person who is apprehensive about such things is berated by various people on an online forum because they want something more concrete to hold onto? Where that more concrete thing to hold onto would be an avenue for not just me but for other people to use as a reason to support this initiative?

This whole thread is disappointing to me...Why are you so vehemently arguing a point you know nothing about then? Or are you just claiming to no nothing about it so you can’t seem like the bad guy, seems like such a disingenuous position. Or you’re just trolling so troll on brohair don’t let me stop yaIt seems like you’re using “detached from the problem” as a synonym for uneducated. You don’t know anything about these issues but are speaking in a way as to claim the people who are actually educated about them are wrong. You also have no way to know you represent the majority opinion.detached from the problem, much like many problems, is generally the nature of the masses. Its not simply that i am uneducated about the nature of starbuck's attitude towards unionizing and how that affects the particularities here in ithaca (a pretty esoteric thing to be aware of, certainly if one finds themself in stem). Thats not to say these things are mutually exclusive, i may be uneducated as well... but thats not the point.

What i am doing is speaking to things in a way that a reasonable person might be skeptical of a given assertion. This does not mean that i am saying what IS.... rather that i cant but sure that what another says IS. I am not claiming anybody is wrong btw... i have been asking for something concrete all throughout this thread.

I dont even plan on being pedantic about a very vague figure... all i would want is something specific regarding this starbucks and how it interfaces with what is currently being seen. An employee in the know could probably do a bit of legwork and have gotten some info from the manager well before this blew up regarding revenue and pricing and blah blah blah. My point is that nobody is producing these things, and yet people feel super comfortable about shouting union busting.

Youre right, i have no way to know i represent the majority opinion... just a strong inkling given what we know about public sentiment in general. Never mind that if i didn't represent the majority opinion, the corollary would be that more than half of the Cornell student body is aware of, is educated in the intricacies of, and supportive of this issue regarding the college town Starbucks. Now if you're going to make that claim, then idk what do do after that. 

Regardless, its a relatively intuitive idea, I think, to suppose that supporters who are passionate about a given issue are a lot more vocal than people who are unaware of said issue. Thus, while it may appear to be very popular issue, the majority opinion is unclear. One way to show this would be just looking at the last presidential election, where more people voted than ever before... yet that amounted to 40% of the country. That 40% was very polarized and loud, but certainly the majority of the country wasn't compelled enough to act. 

Again, please look, in good faith, at what I am saying without addressing some construct of what I appear to be because i skeptical or in opposition to a given viewset. I am merely voicing my opinion and looking to BE informed, and being as cordial as possible while being berated by various people for doing so.It is not the job of the employees to educate you. You have the resources to educate yourself. Did you even watch the video that was linked?again, i don't have any impetus to educate myself. This is the nature of people... i don't know how to express this any other way. If you are in such favor of an initiative that you with to promulgate it throughout your community, you don't put the ownership on various individuals who have never taken the time out of their day to look at these things. If one makes an assertion, the burden of proof is on them... and all of the impetus to give that proof is there too. How does regular Cornell student who can get coffee from 8 other places have any reason to look into this issue unless they are shown the issue.

This whole tangent isn't even relevant to the problem at hand, because I'm simply evidencing why the average person wont have it in there purview to take action about this particular thing out of thin air. My whole thing is hoping to find a solid piece of "this is what is happening and here is proof why Starbucks is just trash" and nothing I've been shown says that.

Edit: this will be my last reply on this thread. I wish somebody would take the time to take what I'm saying in good faith and actually look to find a halfway point where we could have reasonable discourse. I wish you all luck, but frankly this issue lost my support simply because everything I'm see is reminiscent of willfully blind ideology.>  i don't have any impetus to educate myself

If you don't want to educate yourself, fine. But quit talking on this issue then. You've commented more than anyone else in this thread, despite claiming over and over that you don't want to educate yourself on this matter.Dude that’s a really shitty argument. This doesn’t affect me so I have no incentive to educate myself on it? I drink coffee about twice a year, I go to Starbucks less than that. This shut down will not affect my life directly whatsoever but I recognise the bigger issue at hand, I’ve been provided the same info as you have. The hope is that people can care about things that don’t just concern them. I guess it’s fair to say that people don’t have the incentive to care and therefore wont but it’s a stupid argument to make. That’s what the point of these posts is? To try to get people to care? What exactly do you expect them to do?Probably going to be an unpopular take, but I wish somebody that was a part of this strike initiative to be more vocal and provide alot more visual evidence regarding the extent of the perceived damage of the grease trap. It's really hard to believe that this issue, coupled with general disgruntlement, would really justify a strike. Rather simply notifying a local authorities regarding food safety, or OSHA guidelines seems like that would be a good place to start without going nuclear. That said, it's unclear to what lengths they have gone to solve this issue.

Principally, the role of a union is not to wrest power and control from a company for its own sake, but provide an avenue in which employees under its umbrella feel as though they have negotiating agency and a well established line of communication. The problem is if you demonstrate that your union is willing to stop working on a dime and go nuclear for things that might not merit such a response, the company isn't exactly going to be inclined to continue that line of communication. Moreover, we know that this particular Starbucks makes most of its money at two different segments of time in the year, each lasting for 4.5 months. Deciding to impact the most lucrative month (after already having been impacted by covid restrictions) of the first 4.5 months of this year does not bode well in the corporate cost/benefit analysis of maintaining the property. Moreover, we have no idea what the property value/rental costs and operating costs on that Starbucks are... nevermind that a huge competitor (CTB) is closer in proximity to campus and is alot more popular. It's also unclear how the taxing works.

 Bottom line, It's a bit disingenuous, I think, to shout union busting when there are many factors that go into this issue and alot of the details aren't freely available. This isn't in defense of Starbucks per se, but apprehension that a company would simply shut its property down because they don't want to fix a grease trap. There has to be more details.Lol over a grease trap ...🙌🙌🙌This is fucking bullshit!!!! Solidarity ✊Bruh I was planning on joining when I move to Ithaca after summer because I’m already working at Starbucks…well, doesn’t look too good for me now 🫤My local Starbucks always followed local covid ordinances.  Whether one thought they were draconian or not wasn't cause to go full Karen on the baristas.

Believe it or not, I was successfully able to complete my coffee order with a mask on.Unbelievably bad takewait who?“draconian” 🤓how tf did u get into Cornell bro you gotta be stupid as shitbro what are you talking aboutMan you are one crazy dudeRussian troll account.Not right now vectorLmao I love this commentyou don’t even go here lmaoyea but I know it’s supposed to be an ivy and for some reason this post got recommended 2 me so slightly shocked idiots of this level exist in an Ivy tooIt’s called legacy admissionsI’m first-gen and low income…That’s hard to believeNo, it’s not.I went to this Starbucks a few times and the workers always tried to get me to put on a mask. 

Looks like another example of draconian covid policies scaring away customers and being bad for business.Damn bro, so you basically just live your life like “it’s impossible to be treated better by your employer”? That’s pretty pathetic mate“Don’t organize and lose your shitty job!

Edit: I say this as someone who 1. Works hard, 2. Job hunted exactly as you suggested. And guess what? I love the job I have now. It’s exactly what I want, because it serves the exact purpose I aim for it to fulfill. It also took months to secure. Months.

I’m making my reality as I envision it to be. I have goals. When I cut my tongue on my teeth advocating for my needs, ambition bleeds. But none of it has been easy. Nothing has been handed to me, not without me first searching or fighting for it.

Don't lump us in with the Starbucks mobBoycott them, and encourage others to do them. Losing revenue is much more meaningful than a few mean comments on their twitter.Particularly when there are some national award winning local roasters right here in Ithaca that cornell can sell insteadIt closed, now the corp that runs the dining halls has that space and it sucks.Mannible serves (at least last time I was there) coffee from Gimmee!  My regular daily coffee is usually from Copper Horse.  The other one I often have is from Wegmans.I guarauntee you 90% of students could not give the slightest fuck.

Those were details that floated around when the employees were discussing unionizing.the high speed (combi) ovens they use to warm sandwiches are notorious for producing lots of grease.Ah, ok... Previous occupant's grease trap makes sense.

A latte and onion rings would be...odd.Homie your vague remembrance could have been helped by a [quick Reddit search](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/u53p1x/collegetown_starbucks_is_on_strike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or by supporting the Starbucks workers when they spoke on campus, where the store manager described the grease trap in such vivid detail that they cut themself off because they grossed out the crowd ([link to recording](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/events/moment-movement-starbucks-and-slow-drip-starting-union)). 
Bottom line, it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that you, an outsider, assume you have better view of the situation than the workers who are in the store every day. Sbucks union busting is notorious and highly documented, if you watch the workers talk in the above link. Get off your high and mighty stool and actually listen to what the workers are saying, even if you’re not going to support.Oh my gosh that was aggressive.

Nowhere have I assumed to have a better view of the situation, in fact all of my language is built around not knowing various details and being aware of the existence of unknown unknowns. I'm speaking to this specifically BECAUSE I'm an outsider with no feelings one way or the other on the issue of this starbucks. Unfortunately the camp that i fall into is one thay the vast majority of students on campus do as well... and admonishing me(or anybody else like me) for expressing what I think and feel, as well as my various apprehensions is the last thing that is going to get anybody any support.

There is no high horse commentary... just a desire for a more complete approach to the issue beyond just "they don't fix grease trap, we strike, they shut the store down". This is not something that really anybody can form an opinion on in a vacuum, and asking people to rise up based on that narrative alone isn't in good faith.Why are you so vehemently arguing a point you know nothing about then? Or are you just claiming to no nothing about it so you can’t seem like the bad guy, seems like such a disingenuous position. Or you’re just trolling so troll on brohair don’t let me stop yaSerious question: do Starbucks have grease traps?  I thought their menu was mostly already prepped food.my point is surrounding compounding issues. that covid has been impacting the revenue for longer than just this spring semester only goes to evidence the potential instability of income. That store could even be breaking even, but has value in maintaining the Starbucks name at a popular location amongst younger patrons (who will presumably go on to make enough money to sustain regular coffee purchases down the road)... it could even run at a slight deficit. But now with the strike thrown into the mix and potential company perception that the union cant really be worked with at an acceptable level, they bail.

my only point is that their goal is to make money, not to spite random workers in Ithaca. They would only shut down an operation if their cost/benefit analysis indicated that it was an appropriate decision going forward given the environment that particular property rests in.What about the unionized Starbucks popping up around the country? You don’t think that anti-union Starbucks would shut down a location to make an example? Regardless, with the margins that Starbucks makes on those drinks (50 cents for a little bit of oat milk…) and the volume of orders that they get from Cornell students in Ctown, even with a union there is no way that that Starbucks is going under. I think you lack a sense of the bigger picture here. There are definitely reasons that Starbucks would shut down beyond a pure cost benefit analysisI don't know anything about Starbucks unions popping up around the country. I don't know Starbucks's position on unions. 

What I do know is that I (hopefully) am a reasonable person who falls into an educated group of people, who has a particular outlook on things. That outlook is a similar one to many: detached from this problem. Im merely speaking to what i would expect, just like many others would expect as well, as somebody who does not have a lot of impetus to be informed.

I'm a molecular biology major, I don't follow this. This issue does not fit into my sphere of interest of things that I would pursue independently... and I'm not the only one who is like this. Thus if I express that a particular issue doesn't appear intuitive, the goal shouldn't be to talk me down, but perhaps inform me or onlookers. 

Aside from all of that, nothing I've said has actually been refuted. The closest thing to refuting what I've said is your statement regarding margins that Starbucks makes x y and z, vs what they pay.... but we don't know that do we? We done have the numbers... if we do that would be an important thing to share. Everything that I've been told so far revolves around what people think happens, and what somebody said something looks like.  So a reasonable person who is apprehensive about such things is berated by various people on an online forum because they want something more concrete to hold onto? Where that more concrete thing to hold onto would be an avenue for not just me but for other people to use as a reason to support this initiative?

This whole thread is disappointing to me...It seems like you’re using “detached from the problem” as a synonym for uneducated. You don’t know anything about these issues but are speaking in a way as to claim the people who are actually educated about them are wrong. You also have no way to know you represent the majority opinion.detached from the problem, much like many problems, is generally the nature of the masses. Its not simply that i am uneducated about the nature of starbuck's attitude towards unionizing and how that affects the particularities here in ithaca (a pretty esoteric thing to be aware of, certainly if one finds themself in stem). Thats not to say these things are mutually exclusive, i may be uneducated as well... but thats not the point.

What i am doing is speaking to things in a way that a reasonable person might be skeptical of a given assertion. This does not mean that i am saying what IS.... rather that i cant but sure that what another says IS. I am not claiming anybody is wrong btw... i have been asking for something concrete all throughout this thread.

I dont even plan on being pedantic about a very vague figure... all i would want is something specific regarding this starbucks and how it interfaces with what is currently being seen. An employee in the know could probably do a bit of legwork and have gotten some info from the manager well before this blew up regarding revenue and pricing and blah blah blah. My point is that nobody is producing these things, and yet people feel super comfortable about shouting union busting.

Youre right, i have no way to know i represent the majority opinion... just a strong inkling given what we know about public sentiment in general. Never mind that if i didn't represent the majority opinion, the corollary would be that more than half of the Cornell student body is aware of, is educated in the intricacies of, and supportive of this issue regarding the college town Starbucks. Now if you're going to make that claim, then idk what do do after that. 

Regardless, its a relatively intuitive idea, I think, to suppose that supporters who are passionate about a given issue are a lot more vocal than people who are unaware of said issue.

If you want to be rude, be rude... but understand that viewpoints like mine are like those that exist in the majority of people, that one (presumably you) who supports the unionized employees of Starbucks might want to reach.

People who support them are fewer in number, and this movement will only get steam by reaching out and showing a reason to care. If your goal is to disparage those who earnestly respond to an issue in a with no indication of disrespect, you're doing a disservice to those you probably support.mans is dick-riding so hard like howard schultz himself is gonna hand him a job 💀My local Starbucks always followed local covid ordinances.

If you want to be rude, be rude... but understand that viewpoints like mine are like those that exist in the majority of people, that one (presumably you) who supports the unionized employees of Starbucks might want to reach.

People who support them are fewer in number, and this movement will only get steam by reaching out and showing a reason to care. If your goal is to disparage those who earnestly respond to an issue in a with no indication of disrespect, you're doing a disservice to those you probably support.yea but I know it’s supposed to be an ivy and for some reason this post got recommended 2 me so slightly shocked idiots of this level exist in an Ivy tooIt’s called legacy admissionsI’m first-gen and low income…That’s hard to believeNo, it’s not.you don’t even go here lmaoFree market. People are desperate enough to work in shit conditions, workers with higher standards are passed over by companies in favour of those they can more easily take advantage of.


Edit: I say this as someone who 1. Works hard, 2. Job hunted exactly as you suggested. And guess what? I love the job I have now. It’s exactly what I want, because it serves the exact purpose I aim for it to fulfill. It also took months to secure. Months. There was a whole month I had no income, being in between starting this job and ending my previous. Why did I leave my previous jobs? Because they treated me like shit.


I’m making my reality as I envision it to be. I have goals. When I cut my tongue on my teeth advocating for my needs, ambition bleeds. But none of it has been easy. Nothing has been handed to me, not without me first searching or fighting for it.  So when you brush off real peoples real struggles, you only show how insular of a bubble you’ve been afforded to live in, thus far— or how internalized your apathy towards the economic plights of the non elite classes has become.[deleted]People won’t follow through. They have too long been conditioned to take what these corporate entities give them without complaint and besides  how will they ever live without their grande mocha iced lattes??Hey some of us are at home tea drinkers! Don't lump us in with the Starbucks mobAh, ok... Previous occupant's grease trap makes sense.

A latte and onion rings would be...odd.Oh my gosh that was aggressive.

Nowhere have I assumed to have a better view of the situation, in fact all of my language is built around not knowing various details and being aware of the existence of unknown unknowns. I'm speaking to this specifically BECAUSE I'm an outsider with no feelings one way or the other on the issue of this starbucks. Unfortunately the camp that i fall into is one thay the vast majority of students on campus do as well... and admonishing me(or anybody else like me) for expressing what I think and feel, as well as my various apprehensions is the last thing that is going to get anybody any support.

There is no high horse commentary... just a desire for a more complete approach to the issue beyond just "they don't fix grease trap, we strike, they shut the store down". This is not something that really anybody can form an opinion on in a vacuum, and asking people to rise up based on that narrative alone isn't in good faith.Why are you so vehemently arguing a point you know nothing about then? Or are you just claiming to no nothing about it so you can’t seem like the bad guy, seems like such a disingenuous position. Or you’re just trolling so troll on brohair don’t let me stop yaHomie your vague remembrance could have been helped by a [quick Reddit search](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/u53p1x/collegetown_starbucks_is_on_strike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or by supporting the Starbucks workers when they spoke on campus, where the store manager described the grease trap in such vivid detail that they cut themself off because they grossed out the crowd ([link to recording](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/events/moment-movement-starbucks-and-slow-drip-starting-union)). 
Bottom line, it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that you, an outsider, assume you have better view of the situation than the workers who are in the store every day. Sbucks union busting is notorious and highly documented, if you watch the workers talk in the above link. Get off your high and mighty stool and actually listen to what the workers are saying, even if you’re not going to support.I don't know anything about Starbucks unions popping up around the country. I don't know Starbucks's position on unions. 

What I do know is that I (hopefully) am a reasonable person who falls into an educated group of people, who has a particular outlook on things. That outlook is a similar one to many: detached from this problem. Im merely speaking to what i would expect, just like many others would expect as well, as somebody who does not have a lot of impetus to be informed.

I'm a molecular biology major, I don't follow this. This issue does not fit into my sphere of interest of things that I would pursue independently... and I'm not the only one who is like this. Thus if I express that a particular issue doesn't appear intuitive, the goal shouldn't be to talk me down, but perhaps inform me or onlookers. 

Aside from all of that, nothing I've said has actually been refuted. The closest thing to refuting what I've said is your statement regarding margins that Starbucks makes x y and z, vs what they pay.... but we don't know that do we? We done have the numbers... if we do that would be an important thing to share. Everything that I've been told so far revolves around what people think happens, and what somebody said something looks like.  So a reasonable person who is apprehensive about such things is berated by various people on an online forum because they want something more concrete to hold onto? Where that more concrete thing to hold onto would be an avenue for not just me but for other people to use as a reason to support this initiative?

This whole thread is disappointing to me...It seems like you’re using “detached from the problem” as a synonym for uneducated. You don’t know anything about these issues but are speaking in a way as to claim the people who are actually educated about them are wrong. You also have no way to know you represent the majority opinion.detached from the problem, much like many problems, is generally the nature of the masses. Its not simply that i am uneducated about the nature of starbuck's attitude towards unionizing and how that affects the particularities here in ithaca (a pretty esoteric thing to be aware of, certainly if one finds themself in stem). Thats not to say these things are mutually exclusive, i may be uneducated as well... but thats not the point.

What i am doing is speaking to things in a way that a reasonable person might be skeptical of a given assertion. This does not mean that i am saying what IS.... rather that i cant but sure that what another says IS. I am not claiming anybody is wrong btw... i have been asking for something concrete all throughout this thread.

I dont even plan on being pedantic about a very vague figure... all i would want is something specific regarding this starbucks and how it interfaces with what is currently being seen. An employee in the know could probably do a bit of legwork and have gotten some info from the manager well before this blew up regarding revenue and pricing and blah blah blah. My point is that nobody is producing these things, and yet people feel super comfortable about shouting union busting.

Youre right, i have no way to know i represent the majority opinion... just a strong inkling given what we know about public sentiment in general. Never mind that if i didn't represent the majority opinion, the corollary would be that more than half of the Cornell student body is aware of, is educated in the intricacies of, and supportive of this issue regarding the college town Starbucks. Now if you're going to make that claim, then idk what do do after that. 

Regardless, its a relatively intuitive idea, I think, to suppose that supporters who are passionate about a given issue are a lot more vocal than people who are unaware of said issue. Thus, while it may appear to be very popular issue, the majority opinion is unclear. One way to show this would be just looking at the last presidential election, where more people voted than ever before... yet that amounted to 40% of the country. That 40% was very polarized and loud, but certainly the majority of the country wasn't compelled enough to act. 

Again, please look, in good faith, at what I am saying without addressing some construct of what I appear to be because i skeptical or in opposition to a given viewset. I am merely voicing my opinion and looking to BE informed, and being as cordial as possible while being berated by various people for doing so.It is not the job of the employees to educate you. You have the resources to educate yourself. Did you even watch the video that was linked?again, i don't have any impetus to educate myself. This is the nature of people... i don't know how to express this any other way. If you are in such favor of an initiative that you with to promulgate it throughout your community, you don't put the ownership on various individuals who have never taken the time out of their day to look at these things. If one makes an assertion, the burden of proof is on them... and all of the impetus to give that proof is there too. How does regular Cornell student who can get coffee from 8 other places have any reason to look into this issue unless they are shown the issue.

This whole tangent isn't even relevant to the problem at hand, because I'm simply evidencing why the average person wont have it in there purview to take action about this particular thing out of thin air. My whole thing is hoping to find a solid piece of "this is what is happening and here is proof why Starbucks is just trash" and nothing I've been shown says that.

Edit: this will be my last reply on this thread. I wish somebody would take the time to take what I'm saying in good faith and actually look to find a halfway point where we could have reasonable discourse. I wish you all luck, but frankly this issue lost my support simply because everything I'm see is reminiscent of willfully blind ideology.>  i don't have any impetus to educate myself

If you don't want to educate yourself, fine. But quit talking on this issue then. You've commented more than anyone else in this thread, despite claiming over and over that you don't want to educate yourself on this matter.Dude that’s a really shitty argument. This doesn’t affect me so I have no incentive to educate myself on it? I drink coffee about twice a year, I go to Starbucks less than that. This shut down will not affect my life directly whatsoever but I recognise the bigger issue at hand, I’ve been provided the same info as you have. The hope is that people can care about things that don’t just concern them. I guess it’s fair to say that people don’t have the incentive to care and therefore wont but it’s a stupid argument to make. That’s what the point of these posts is? To try to get people to care? What exactly do you expect them to do?What about the unionized Starbucks popping up around the country? You don’t think that anti-union Starbucks would shut down a location to make an example? Regardless, with the margins that Starbucks makes on those drinks (50 cents for a little bit of oat milk…) and the volume of orders that they get from Cornell students in Ctown, even with a union there is no way that that Starbucks is going under. I think you lack a sense of the bigger picture here. There are definitely reasons that Starbucks would shut down beyond a pure cost benefit analysisIt’s called legacy admissionsI’m first-gen and low income…That’s hard to believeNo, it’s not.yea but I know it’s supposed to be an ivy and for some reason this post got recommended 2 me so slightly shocked idiots of this level exist in an Ivy tooFree market.

I guess it’s fair to say that people don’t have the incentive to care and therefore wont but it’s a stupid argument to make. That’s what the point of these posts is? To try to get people to care? What exactly do you expect them to do?again, i don't have any impetus to educate myself. This is the nature of people... i don't know how to express this any other way. If you are in such favor of an initiative that you with to promulgate it throughout your community, you don't put the ownership on various individuals who have never taken the time out of their day to look at these things. If one makes an assertion, the burden of proof is on them... and all of the impetus to give that proof is there too. How does regular Cornell student who can get coffee from 8 other places have any reason to look into this issue unless they are shown the issue.

This whole tangent isn't even relevant to the problem at hand, because I'm simply evidencing why the average person wont have it in there purview to take action about this particular thing out of thin air. My whole thing is hoping to find a solid piece of "this is what is happening and here is proof why Starbucks is just trash" and nothing I've been shown says that.

Edit: this will be my last reply on this thread. I wish somebody would take the time to take what I'm saying in good faith and actually look to find a halfway point where we could have reasonable discourse. I wish you all luck, but frankly this issue lost my support simply because everything I'm see is reminiscent of willfully blind ideology.>  i don't have any impetus to educate myself

If you don't want to educate yourself, fine. But quit talking on this issue then. You've commented more than anyone else in this thread, despite claiming over and over that you don't want to educate yourself on this matter.Dude that’s a really shitty argument. This doesn’t affect me so I have no incentive to educate myself on it? I drink coffee about twice a year, I go to Starbucks less than that.

I couldn’t find a lot of information about it online. Could anyone tell me what the test is like and what kinds of things I should be reviewing? Thanks!College of Engineering PrelawI always thought I wanted to do computer science. But, as I look at it more I realized it was just all for the money. I’m still fine with doing it of course , but I wanted to open the door to law , since debate has always been a passion of mine 

Now, I know the average GPA for this college is disgusting . But , I wanted to know if there were any prelaws in this college that could give me some advice , or people who switched majors to pursue prelaw etc.Are you doing stem , and if so , we’re you table to keep a high gpa ?Im not stem, no. Im prelawOh ok 👍 thanks for the adviceYou actually dont have to change your major to be prelaw. Stem majors can work in IP law and its super lucrative because you have to be a stem major to do so.... how was it like keeping your gpa high enough for law?Gpa is not highI’m in info sci and on jury duty and discrete math is mapping this shit out in my head in real timeThis is interesting , I’ll definitely look at joiningI have no expertise on the engineering school in particular, so I can’t really answer your actual question. But you might be interested in the Speech and Debate society, where a lot of the people who graduate go to law school. Also, if you have an engineering background that might make you a good fit for intellectual property law, and a good story/pitch might help you overcome a lower GPA. Hope someone with more expertise also chimes in.ChemE in college of engineering, I considered law school briefly. from my understanding you could maybe scrape by with a 3.5 gpa because law schools do cut some slack for stem majors because they are aware of how hard stem programs can be.As far as I know, there is no prelaw major at Cornell, and -- frankly -- prelaw "majors" are a waste of time.   The content is indistinguishable from a government/polisci major, and doesn't place you in a position to do much if you choose a different path later on.

Law school skills are about broad-ranging analytical ability first, written argument second, and perhaps general writing skill third.  An undergraduate degree that hones your analytical ability (and not your ability to memorize and repeat) should be your first objective.  Making that degree work for you if you choosing a non-law career should be your second objective.  Fill the gaps with courses heavy on critical writing skills.

At your age, unless you have a parent who is a practicing lawyer, you have no idea what the practice of law is really like.  It's not wise to put all your chips on the square that you know little about.   Have a plan "B".

If anyone is interested in subletting an apartment (1 or 2 rooms) over the summer, let me know!How to stop comparing myself with others?I was doing well in the finals and getting As, but literally at least one of my friend is getting A+ in each of the class I'm taking. The same thing happens in the previous semester.

My goal in the college is to enter a good phd program in my area of interest, but to be honest, I feel like my confidence is being wrecked by people around me. Some of them do good research as well as consistently getting better grades than me (like a 4.1+ gpa), whereas I was rejected to internships, REUs, as well as getting ignored by professors to whom I inquired research opportunities.

I have a wide range of interest and is doing a double major and a minor. The consequence is, in each major I was outcompeted by people who concentrate on that field, and it seems inevitable. But how do I know what I'm really passionate about without devoting time for trials?

I understand I need a healthy mindset where I don't feel bad about myself or feel jealous about other people's success, but this is so much easier said than done. I can't help thinking what I could have done differently (like start looking for research earlier, not making careless mistakes in exams, and avoid those classes where I learned very few things).

Right now I'm overwhelmed by these feelings that I'm having a hard time concentrating on my life and study. I know I should quit self-pity and refocus. Writing on reddit will not likely resolve my problems, but I really need an outlet. Any suggestion/opinion is sincerely appreciated!Compare yourself to me instead, I’m nowhere near that lol.I am also doing the same exact thingI wouldn’t mind having all As tbh 😳

But as J cole said, there’s no such thing as the life that’s better than yours, no such thing as the life that’s better than yours, no such thing as the life that’s better than yours, no such thing, no such thingwise wordsTruly. Thanks for your wordsLol I am comparing myself to you as I read your post 😕Great comment.

Grad student here. The undergrads in our lab mostly emailed graduate students they found on our lab website. We would then chat with them to make sure they understood what we do and had some background knowledge to help a bit on a project, and then we would take them to our advisor to fill out paperwork for course credit. 

Can't guarantee you'll get responses, but it's another avenue that might work out slightly better than trying to get a response out of a busy professor.If you’re getting all As that’s a great place to be. A+s are pretty rare in a lot of classes (though perhaps not in your major, idk). In general, I think of an A+ as being a reward for someone who did something extra, and went above and beyond, and I don’t think many grad schools will care if you don’t have many (or any) A+s. If your goal is to enter a good PhD program, you’re on track.

If you want to get to grad school tho, you will need research experience. If you’re ignored by professors, go knock on their doors, send them email reminders after a week, etc etc. Youre gonna have to fight for a position. 

REUs are notoriously hard to get, and many of them actually give preference to students from universities with weaker research programs. However, there often are a few programs which are particularly good for Cornell students, so I’d talk to grad students and professors about this. (This is based on my experience in my fields at least, which I learned in hindsight unfortunately). 

In regards to your second to last paragraph: Hindsight is a bitch. I’ve been there and sometimes only time and further success can make you forget about your mistakes. That said, it does not seem like you have made any really big mistakes. Your goal is to get to grad school. Not to get the highest GPA or the most internships or the fewest mistakes on your exams. It’s grad schools. You’re thinking small picture; think big picture, and realize you’re in a good position. 

One last thing: It dosent matter that your friends might have slightly higher GPAs; I’ve seen people with 3.8 GPAs get into better places than people with GPAs close to 4.0. Research and connections are what matter most once you have a good GPA. Also, I would talk to as many professors, grad students, and former undergrads from Cornell about grad school before you apply. You may think you know what you’re doing when you go to apply, but they will likely give very important advice. I would esp. talk to grad students; Professors can have a skewed or out of touch view of the process.There will always people who are better, richer, better looking or whatever than you. And you will be superior to others in all of these categories. Better to be your best and not worry about the others. Make yourself happy with whatever you are involved in. Others won’t matterNot sure about suggestions; just wanted to say that I often feel the same way when I compare myself with some of my friendsGrad student here! Just sent you a text, hope my opinion on this helpsTbh I used to compare myself with others a lot when I was in high school but I don’t do that anymore. I think the key (at least for me) is to realize that everyone has different tracks and everyone is unique. Some ppl have crazy gpas, others have amazing research experience/internships, but you certainly don’t have to be the same as them. Think about the poems or songs you write, think about the movies or books you love. You’re made up of things much more than grades, research and internships. Humans are not born to be compared, we’re born to feel and enjoy our own lives.

P.S. I’m not trying to discourage you from grinding hard and looking for opportunities. Just don’t let others, especially your interpretations of “others” disturb you that much.feel yaI wouldn’t mind having all As tbh 😳

I comment this every time... just put the price in the listing. There's no good reason not to. Don't make people message you for it, which will waste their time if it's not within their budget.

Don't assume that what you think is "very affordable" is actually seen that way by everyone else. Give the number and let people decide for themselves. If it's actually a good deal, they'll contact you for more details.

How possible is that for a junior?  Is it worth it?I think Greek life wasn’t that big where he was. Also, knew he wanted to transfer out.I was just giving an example of the type of questions he’d get asked as a junior transfer. No need to justify it to me lmaoLol. Not justifying. That’s the scenario, so wondering if that makes sense. I personally told him it’s late in the game. But maybe not.He will probably face questions about why he didn’t rush at his previous school. A good number of houses won’t bid juniors unless they were an active in the same chapter at a different university.

The number of houses that will bid unaffiliated juniors is limited, but considering the state of Cornell greek life he should get a bid somewhere. Being a transfer also helps, it’s a red flag if someone was at Cornell for 2 years already and didn’t rush.Not super common but i had a junior in my PC, especially if a transfer I don’t think there’s anything weird/out of place with it. Feel like fraternities have a similar view, if they like you they like youNot true, frats do fall and spring rush, fall is just not open to freshman. As a Junior he should be able to. I would second the above comment, just depends who he vibes with, but I’m not in Greek life so not certainReally any social club will take anybody they feel they connect with and feel add somthing to their community. I'm sure some frats only want sophomores and freshmen, but I don't think that's ubiquitous across all groups. Definitly possible and definitly worth it, especially if he finds a group that resonates with him. It really is a good way to branch out and find a social circle... although rush is generally in the spring soooo, that's a small hurdle.Not common but not unusual, especially for smaller houses. Def worth rushing and seeing what happens imoIt’s worth rushing in the fall, some houses will consider him if they like him as a personif your friend plays a sport tell him to look at some of the club teams. i know the club baseball, soccer, hockey, lax, rugby teams are pretty tight knit. there are also a lot of cultural orgs he can look into. there is also the band and you don't need to have any prior experience to join. greek life is great but it isn't the only way to make friendsI was just giving an example of the type of questions he’d get asked as a junior transfer.

It also has some quant, walkable towns, which stands out when compared to traditional American suburbia, chock full of strip malls and highways. 


Westchester is smaller, less diverse, more uniformly upscale (despite pockets that are not), slightly greener within commuting areas (beyond Yonkers, Mt. Vernon, and New Rochelle) but less quaint and more “typical America”-looking, an easier drive to more or less everywhere aside from Long Island, and more impressive in terms of nature towards its northern fringes. Excellent schools and commutes as well.

That's kinda wildVerbal quote when looking for a restaurant storefront for a student businessaight time for some cornell students to make an affordable coffee shop in ctown gogogoOkay I’m less drunk now. Starbucks still hasn’t given a very clear answer to “why are you closing our store”, but it seems to be that they’re implying the store isn’t profitable enough and requires too much money to be remodeling it (most likely in reference to the grease trap in the back of house that causes a lot of issues). I’m not sure if it’s legal for me to directly quote them from their store meetings with us or their emails so imma be rewording everything.Probably an effort for corporate Starbucks to undermine public faith in unionization. Starbucks would have enough money to pay its property rent given that college students are caffeine addicts. So saying that it was not able to make enough money is not a reason to blame its shutdown.Yup, they lost a lot of customers over the past couple years due to imposing draconian covid restrictions like mask mandates. I’m not surprised the store isn’t profitable enough to keep open anymore as a consequence.There's a good chance it is because of this, which is beyond lame. The Starbucks is usually very busy with customers and it will be disappointing to have yet another empty storefront (and limited coffee options).basedWhy is it shutting down?it’s a complicated situation rn, and I’ll post an update when I have more information from corporate Starbucks and I’m less drunk ❤️👍🏼am awake and sober, so my understanding of what Starbucks told us is that they are closing the location due to it not being profitable enough and requiring a high amount of maintenance due to the grease trap in the back. This is questionable for a few reasons, and valid for a few others. The store has a cyclical profitability based off whether Cornell is in session or not, and during the summers it obviously tanks in terms of profitability. Makes sense to close the store then. But they’re closing it permanently, which was made explicitly clear, which is confusing because during the school year it’s Extremely profitable. 🤷‍♂️

The grease trap is also weird because they’ve been discussing doing the remodel this summer, and seemed to have plans for fixing up the store, especially after we struck a few months back over it, but then spontaneously went actually we’re closing the store forever goodbye.It would seem to be so.

Another great look for empty Collegetown storefronts.The other Starbucks aren’t closing so this one was probably just terrible. I’ve been to the others and they were both more crowded and better run. And of course the rent here is astronomical. There should be a high fine for empty storefronts that increases each year.The other Starbucks are actually less busy, at least during the school year. During the summer the other locations become way more busy, the college Ave location is very dependent on the Cornell and Ithaca colleges. In terms of management, they other two locations definitely have more competent managers than ours (in terms of the last few months).wow. people are losing their jobs and this is what you care about? get a lifeDowntown is packed year round. The drive through also has lines and rent is much less. Collegetown has been empty every time I’ve gone. No IC people go there either. They go downtown.People lose their jobs when businesses are bad. Maybe when you finish ILR you’ll understand it. There’s a labor shortage everywhere in Ithaca so it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a better job. Maybe they’ll even get an injunction against the closing.I’ve worked at the downtown location and the collegetown location, the downtown location is busy all year, but during the school year the mobile orders at collegetown outweigh the normal day at downtown. The mobile orders make up probably 80% of orders at ct, which means that if you go in person you don’t see the vast majority of orders being placed and completed.Maybe so, but that doesn't mean it's as profitableIs this related to the recent unionization?

Is it easier for Starbucks corporate to just shut down the store, rather than deal with unionized employees?i believe nothing, it’ll probably just be an empty buildingwhat are they putting thereIt’s ok Enzo pizza openI work there 😃How did you know?Pinkertons win again. ILR in shamblesCopper Horse Coffee in the law schoolnot exactly ctown but gimme in gates is somewhat close… not the best alternative though;;Gimme in gates isn't too too far but I agreeGimme at Gates is awesome, not sure it it's open during the summers though?It will be open over the summer, same hours though so closed after 3pm and on weekends.That actually sucks. CTB is a disgrace of an institution and there's not really anywhere else to get coffee in ctown besides 7/11.Temple of zeus >>>>>>OKnfelloe coffee enthusiasts who wants to start the next best collegetown coffee shopHopefully Sunday is next 🤞ha ha funnyWill you guys hand out discounts or free food or something?When you side with corporations that don’t give a shit about you over your fellow worker 🤡literally the union was because starbucks doesn't care about it's workers which can be seen by the fact they gave the employees a week notice about the fact they will all potentially be unemployedHow’s the corporate boot taste?why's everyone such an ideologue? I'd consider myself generally pro-union, but all these workers are now out of a job. Is that the intended result?when you unionize to try to get more money and now you get no money 🤡CTB has pretty meh coffee. Is there another store that you're referring to?Ctb coffee is disgustingIf only there were a non corporate, locally owned competitor literally right next door....there is one in the commons, but it’s kinda far from campus so the ctown one was the best option. there are a number of different places to get coffee on campus thoughthere are a few Starbucks on campus itself, like the one in Olin library and in noyes, but they aren’t like actual Starbucks, they just serve a few Starbucks recipes in Starbucks cups but yk it’s coffeeincoming caffeine addicted freshman here. are there any other starbucks nearby or was the ctown one, the only one? thank you!!What happened?Thank god I graduated just before thatlmao there hasn’t been a mask mandate in the store in like 4 monthsOnly a Sith deals in absolutes.It has been a few months since I’ve been there. The problem is once a business imposes such draconian policies, they lose customers permanently even after the policy is removed.dude, the amount of people who cared about it the Covid mask policy was around  1-5%, the vast majority of customers not only were okay with it but agreed with it. There hasn’t been a mask mandate in the store in months and at least half of the customers will still wear masks when they come in. The reasoning for the store closing has nothing to do with customer retention.No, it is much higher than 1-5%. You’re basing your conclusions on the customers who come into the store, but the customers who have been scared off aren’t coming into the store!the customers who don’t come into the store aren’t customers and there was no significant dip in profits between pre Covid and post covid, the only dip was during covidFeel free to provide their financial documents to prove thatthat would be ~illegal~ for me to do, but they’ll probably be publicly released while the union bargains about the store closing. but as the guy who works at that store full time, people don’t get tight about masks anywhere near as much as you think they doWell I’m not going to take any stock in the profit claim then until it’s shown. 

Those people used to be customers and are now gone. You don’t see them because the draconian policies have scared them away.I went to this Starbucks a few times and the workers always tried to get me to put on a mask.

Looks like another example of draconian covid policies scaring away customers and being absolutely catastrophic for businesses.There’s no way in hell, I’m sorry. Apple pays a million a year or so for its GRAND CENTRAL Apple Store Location.alright come thru rich international students. also where did you get that information? there's no way most of these spots are making $2m+ a yearThe quote we got may have been high so we would fuck off. They probably want someone reputable for the long term lease (ie. fast food).The empty corner across from Starbucks was quoted at that price for a 10 year leasesheeesh no wonder collegetown is becoming a ghosttownWhere can you see these numbers?  That's kinda wildVerbal quote when looking for a restaurant storefront for a student businessRent ~~is typically~~ can be >$2M/yr for retail space in CtownYup, they lost a lot of customers over the past couple years due to imposing draconian covid restrictions like mask mandates. I’m not surprised the store isn’t profitable enough to keep open anymore as a consequence.Okay I’m less drunk now. Starbucks still hasn’t given a very clear answer to “why are you closing our store”, but it seems to be that they’re implying the store isn’t profitable enough and requires too much money to be remodeling it (most likely in reference to the grease trap in the back of house that causes a lot of issues). I’m not sure if it’s legal for me to directly quote them from their store meetings with us or their emails so imma be rewording everything.There's a good chance it is because of this, which is beyond lame. The Starbucks is usually very busy with customers and it will be disappointing to have yet another empty storefront (and limited coffee options).basedProbably an effort for corporate Starbucks to undermine public faith in unionization. Starbucks would have enough money to pay its property rent given that college students are caffeine addicts. So saying that it was not able to make enough money is not a reason to blame its shutdown.it’s a complicated situation rn, and I’ll post an update when I have more information from corporate Starbucks and I’m less drunk ❤️👍🏼am awake and sober, so my understanding of what Starbucks told us is that they are closing the location due to it not being profitable enough and requiring a high amount of maintenance due to the grease trap in the back. This is questionable for a few reasons, and valid for a few others. The store has a cyclical profitability based off whether Cornell is in session or not, and during the summers it obviously tanks in terms of profitability. Makes sense to close the store then. But they’re closing it permanently, which was made explicitly clear, which is confusing because during the school year it’s Extremely profitable. 🤷‍♂️

I began writing this on April 15th, 2022. I wanted to give insight into my progress and goals/plan for the subsequent weeks. If you have read my Reddit post entitled Terrible Semester, you are aware I have been placed on academic probation and was able to appeal a leave of absence (LOA). 

*Here is the link to my previous post:* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/s3e9z0/terrible\_semester\_freshman/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/s3e9z0/terrible_semester_freshman/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

This semester, I had to fulfill requirements or my position at Cornell would be held under further review. The requirements necessitated I have a minimum of a 2.3 GPA, and no failing grades with at least 12 credits. Even before the semester started, I was highly motivated and driven, primarily by the fear of being deemed a failure again. Before returning to Cornell (after the first semester), I outlined my goals. I wanted all A's except in one class, in which a B was sufficient for me. I obsessively watched videos discussing "how to be an A student" and amassed tips to achieve my goals. 

***A quick note before I share my advice and tips:*** 

Grades do not define you, but school is school. You go to school to get grades. That is the reality of it. Yes, you are there to learn, but let us not pretend they are not significant. Last semester, while I did terribly on paper,  I learned so much. I love Cornell, yet the financial aspect has presented some challenges for me. So, having the best grades possible for scholarships and various opportunities is crucial for me. You may be rolling your eyes as I profess my love for Cornell, but when you risk having everything taken away from you, you begin valuing things once taken for granted. I have realized that school is a game, that you either play correctly or do not. Here are the tips and perspectives I employed in my daily life. Moreover, if you are on academic probation, here are some tips to consider for your next semester. Some tips may be self-explanatory or even basic, yet they were helpful as I began seeing improvements in my work. 

*"Front-Load Your Courses": do well at the beginning of the semester to set a precedent for your work.* The first two weeks of the semester are crucial. During this time, professors (and TAs) observe what kind of student you are and the type of work you contribute. Even if you are in bigger classes, attempt to establish that you are a driven and motivated student dedicated to the advancement of your learning. When teachers have a positive image of you, especially in more intimate classroom settings, you receive better grades for your work. Yes, this is rather idealistic, however, I have observed by communicating with professors, they continually offer guidance on how to better approach their assignments/exams. Furthermore, when you set a precedent for your work you seek to uphold your self-established standard. Lastly, anything can happen throughout the semester. Sometimes the syllabus changes due to various circumstances or family emergencies arise. Having a perfect grade at the midpoint of the semester (or before the last major exam or assignment) in most of your courses will give you a lot of leeway. \[Caution: "front-loading" should not serve as an excuse to procrastinate or submit less than superb work, but act as a safety net\] 

*Sit in the front of your classes and PARTICIPATE*: If you have the issue of skipping classes without guilt, here is a way to prevent that. I believe if you are paying for an education and frequently skipping classes, it's a waste of your or your parent's money. Skipping every once in a while is acceptable, but not advised in my humble opinion. When you participate and sit in the front, your presence is recognized. If you are on academic probation, you are there to prove to yourself that you can be successful. Even if you are not confident in the subject matter of the course, try and contribute your perspective. When the professor asks a question in class, attempt to answer it. I noticed that being an active student aiming to do well receives the attention of other high-achieving students. When you become "academic friends" with them, sometimes their company will hold you accountable. Also, you can learn a thing or two from them. 

*"Manifest Grades"*: *Envision the desired grade and outcome for every assignment, prelim, and exam.* This may be odd, but it makes perfect sense to me. With every upcoming assignment or prelim/exam, I would declare my desired grade and write how well I did on a whiteboard or mirror. For example, I would write "presentation for \[insert class name\] grade A, great public speaking abilities". I did this before starting the assignment or even studying for the exam. While this seems like an easy way to do things, it does not exempt you from doing the work. This helped me, as it mapped out the quality of work I needed to do and inspired me to believe excellent grades were achievable. As stated prior my goal was 3 A's and 1 B. 

*Figure out your learning method:* This is pretty rudimentary, but figure out what type of learner you are. Frankly, I am constantly figuring out what kind of learner I am. The course material/subject usually shapes how I study/do the work. For example, I am by no means a math person. To do math, I found I needed to conduct my notes in a very specific way. But essentially yourself questions like, "am I a visual learner? Do I learn better when I arrange my notes a certain way? Am I someone who can learn concepts fairly quickly? Are active recall and spaced repetition the best methods for me?

*The really simple stuff*: buy a planner, Microsoft One Note is very good for organizing your courses and study with others.

***June 2nd, 2022:*** 

So today is June 2nd, 2022. Looking back, there is still much to learn! While I employed all these tips and have received feedback from my teachers and grades for all my classes, next semester I seek to do my work further ahead of time and spent more time being an active learner during class time. Lol, I sound like a primary schooler, but I am very motivated to have a better cumulative GPA. Below I attached my grades from the fall to spring semester. 

&#x200B;

[I know, these grades are terrible. \* I was taking a couple of higher level courses in the first semester...which is not something I advise, yet, I got my best grade in my 4000 level course... ](https://preview.redd.it/wezka3o97g391.png?width=346&format=png&auto=webp&s=1534478beadd27ed649f423c0bd0edd50bf164d6)

&#x200B;

[Much better! \*It also helped that I was only taking 4 classes compared to five.

I just finished my undergrad in Canada and don’t know anyone at Cornell (or much about the uni) so I’m eager to make some new friends and get involved! Or if anyone wants to chat I’d be happy to message :) If it helps with recommendations, I’m super into animals, neuroscience, sports, parties, LGBTQ+ events, etc. Appreciate it!Enzo's basement jacuzzi is one of my most memorable experiences at Cornell.

It can be lonely and overwhelming when you first move here, but I’m of the state of mind that everything always works out okay in the end.You’re not alone and this is very normal and it will pass. When I first moved to my Ithaca apartment I had the exact same thing and it just took time. You will be ok. ❤️Yeah dude I hate settling it’s very hard for me to be happy unless I’m already settled.I'm moving to the city today! Shoot me a dm if you need someone to talk to :)Why did people steal all the letters from the Cornell sign?I think it’s funnyCause they’re selfish jerks.

I think one person doing it probably caused a bunch of people think “oh that’s a good idea” since as far as I know this has never happened beforeCould be martha who took em down, so new ones can be replacedI think it’s funnyCS 2110 and ENGRD 2110I've already taken CS 2110 from arts&sciences but if I switch to engineering, can I use CS2110 in place of ENGRD 2110 and get credit for it as a distribution? Are they interchangeable like that?CS2110 is ENGRD 2110 (they’re the exact same class). You should be able to get ENGRD credit if you take CS 2110, just make sure you let the registrar know before you graduateYes, both are acceptable. You do not need to take it as the cross listed version just to get ENGRD credit.

https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/rulesandproceduresengineering/engineeringchecklistHow tough is it for junior transfers to make friends on campus?As a recently accepted junior ECE transfer to Cornell, I was wondering if any previous junior transfers could share their social life experience in Cornell. Having half of the college covered already, were you able to have a lively social life on campus? I am worries since often in college by junior year people tend to have solidified friends groups which are hesitant to expand further. I assume dorming in a quad/triple/double could help greatly as an initial boost to meet people.I am sorry to hear that. I hope your senior year went by far better! :)It was really hard for me unfortunately :( I had a really lonely year. But I was unlucky and was not placed near or with other transfers. And I’m also an introvert with social anxiety, so that probably didn’t help either lolDo you know if Cornell itself takes care of placing all transfer close to each other? Thank you tho, that was a reliefI, as a transfer, was placed in a suite with 3 other transfers and another dude who was a transfer. Some of my friends were on floors where the entire floor was transfers. But I also had friends who got placed alone on North. So I'd say Cornell ideally places transfers close to each other most of the time but because of limited housing it doesn't happen all the time.Thank you!!Most transfers are dorming on the same floor or suite or whatever so a lot of friends u make are transfers. From there it’s pretty much what u make of it.Don’t worry! I’m not a transfer but I have a bunch of friends who are junior transfers. It’s easy for transfers to know each other as well based on what I’ve heard.Thank you!!I transferred in fall 2021 as Junior in CAS and so far my experience has been phenomenal! Cornell is really welcoming when it comes to transfers; the friend group I made during Orientation week has stuck together till now even though we are in completely different schools and majors. So definitely take advantage of events during o-week to get to know other people. I also going thru core classes for my major I met a lot of great peeps as well. Wishing you the best, ik it'll turn out great!I am sorry to hear that. I hope your senior year went by far better! :)I, as a transfer, was placed in a suite with 3 other transfers and another dude who was a transfer.

I love the song. We have the same taste. Could you please play love story from the movie love story for me as well?🎶Where do I begin🎶damn I checked the chime concert schedule before it got updated again today. Didn't expect them to have so many concertsRate my ProfessorMake sure y’all get on there are rate your professors to help your fellow Cornellians out. Also a question… can professors get on there and request that their ratings be removed? Before I took a terrible class this semester I thought I remembered seeing terrible ratings for the prof, but when it was actually time to sign up for classes, they were gone. I thought I must just be remembering wrong, but I feel like this prof should have ratings. She’s been at Cornell for a while, it was a big enough class, and she was absolutely terrible.I agree, it is helpful to other students to post honest reviews.Yes, I think ratings can be removed. I rate most of my profs very highly (from a previous school) I had one genuinely incompetent professor who should not have been teaching and wrote an honest review of them (no inflammatory wording or personal attacks, which can get a post removed) and the posting disappeared.The same prof had a few reviews of stuff like "love them! gives out candy during exams!" Which was totally weird since they didn't have exams in any of their classes. Over time I saw a few reviews for other professors with the same comment about profs being "saints who gave out candy during exams" as well as some glowing reviews of some well known terrible profs, so my guess was some newer profs (as this one was) were hiring people to post good reviews. It was a while ago when Rate was newer and more people used it.That said, I have seen negative posts, so perhaps people can request a certain number to be removed?>help your fellow Cornellians out.

It’s a ~4 hr ride and I’m just seeking some company for the roadRavenwood apartmentsI’m studying for a semester in Cornell this fall and looking for somewhere to rent. Ravenwood seems to be the only place that will do a short term lease. Does anyone know what it’s like?I have a couple friends who live there and their place is pretty nice. No glaring issues as far as I knowI lived there for two semesters, I just moved out after graduating. It's really nice and quiet, no major issues.

I personally didn't interact with the landlord that much, but whenever we had issues, we'd submit a maintenance request and it'll get resolved within a few days, depending on the severity. 

Depending on which unit you get, the laundry room might be kinda far or annoying to get to, especially when it snows. When it snows, they do a pretty good job of plowing the stairs and pathways. 

The 4 bedroom units have two floors which is really nice. There's a lot of living room space. The 3 bedroom units may feel kinda cramped, depending on what you're used toI’ve had friends live there and it was nice, clean, and quiet. Definitely a good place. And it’s at the bottom of west below the slope so you’ll have a walking hobbyLooking for comp bio / bioinformatics adviceHi everyone! I'm a rising junior in the bio major with a concentration in computational biology. I'm generally interested in going to grad school for comp bio/bioinformatics, but I'm having trouble with course selection and my advisor also seems unsure of which courses I should take. I was wondering if I could talk to an undergrad or grad student who's familiar with the comp bio course offerings and which ones would best prepare me for grad school. Thanks!!Honestly just take what interests you - most grad programs aren’t even going to look at your course historyGetting a Single as a TransferHow hard/easy is it to get a single dorm as a sophomore transfer in for example West Campus?

You just got out of class. Martha's weather balloon malfunctioned today and Ithaca sees its first beautiful day of spring. Sparse clouds of cotton sail across the blue, and the songbirds' melody blesses your ears with a tune so comforting that your body relaxes for the first time in ages. *"Take that, Martha!"* you say to yourself as you step into the sunshine and shed your body of your gently-worn Canada Goose. The sun kisses your skin, and you can't help but let out a faint toothy smile..

... *"This is it"*

Your phone rings, and it's u/cornellblockpartyman. 

"Hey there, **insert name**, we're having a block party down in CTown and I was wondering if you'd like to join us?"

"I'd absolutely love to, u/cornellblockpartyman, but I'm afraid that I have nothing to wear!" You close your eyes and recall the clothing pile that you always sort through when getting dressed in the mornings.

"Don't worry, **insert name**. Come as you are. It's going to be fun and I'm sure you look great."

.................

You stumble up the steps of the faded yellow house, clutching to the railing with clammy palms. The music is thundering and everyone seems to know everyone here. You nervously scan the crowd trying to find somebody familiar, *anybody* familiar, that you can approach without sparking yet another public panic attack. 

"Hey, **insert name**, get your ass over here!"

Your head jerks towards the right side of the yard and you see your friends excitedly gesturing you towards a shiny red beer bong. u/cornellblockpartyman is perched atop the weathered second story balcony pouring PBR into the beer bong's funnel.

*"Oh fuck yes"*

.......

Yada yada yada, you find true love or something, the engineering students finally get laid, and you wake up with a hangover and a bra that belongs to your busty MILF ex-step mom that you always wished you could score.

Excellent.

Is my life ruined?I always thought I’d apply for grad school and get an MBA but i know that went down the drain.

I’m now considering just going straight into industry. But knowing that employers  also check transcript I don’t even know if thats an option anymore.

Is my life ruined? I feel so s***idal and i’m just so devastated. Idk what to do anymore.FWIW, I have a 3 withdrawals on my transcript and an F in a course that didn’t count towards my GPA and still managed to get into grad school for CS here so don’t lose hope!Yes, 90% of jobs will never ask for transcript.I also wanted to point out that for a lot of jobs, they never actually look at your transcript in the hiring process.This is exactly right.15 years here. Facts.Is your life ruined because you had a bad few months academically? Fuck no lol. In 15 years you’ll look back on this and wonder how you ever thought thatThis. Don’t get me wrong, grades matter but only in certain fields and only for that first job. So with out the grades it is slightly harder to get in but absolutely and by no means is it impossible. 

I was in your shoes a long time ago. It was harder for me to get my foot in the door than my classmates at Cornell, but after that initial cut of resumes for the first job, no one has ever asked me for my GPA or how long it took me to get my degree. 

I will say this, Cornell alumni are simply the best. I haunted the alumni network and spammed tens of people. Most of who made time for me, got me first round interviews. Super grateful to them for helping a schlub with terrible grades, only because they went to the same school. 

To repeat what u/Complete9041 said - do some introspection, figure out what you want to do, find alumni who do similar stuff and give it your best shot. 

Life is too long and you are too young for simple things like bad grades to bring you down. I always thought I did better than my peers at work because I was more comfortable with failure than them, with their 4.0s through school. 

Best wishes to you. You will do well. Have faith in yourself.Life is much more than grades or degrees, but the part about doing what you love, that's baloney.  People fail at what they love all the time.  They also live in poverty and regret it later.  Try to find something you like and are reasonably good at.  And don't try to be the BEST at anything, there's no such thing, and chasing that will make you miserable. 

But....your life is definitely not over nor is your career.  I think you could still get into an MBA program, but you actually might want to work at a job or two first and see what you really are into, business is a WIDE field.  

W's are nothing.  An F isn't great but it won't sink you either.  You will do fine in the long run if you can roll with the punches, and there will be more punches.  Not sure what year you are or your major, business?  But, get some good internships while you're here.  Cornell is sadistic with grading, its almost like hazing here (something they ban for frats, but wear with pride as a school?!)  I do see them crushing peoples souls at this place, which is a shame.  But, they do have lots of career opportunities.  Take advantage of everything they offer.  Have you gotten an internship for the summer yet?  It isn't too late.  Get busy doing real work instead of school work for a few months.  Next summer, if you're not graduating yet try to line something up early that will look really good for your resume and might teach you a lot.

Also, have you thought about government?  You could intern in Washington/congress or the senate possibly on a committee that would interest you.  You might like it and those people F up all the time.   

(Now that I think about it, ...everybody screws up all the time, you just don't always hear about it because it isn't what they tell you about themselves.)

If you want to PM me feel free.  I can send some links for congressional internships.Life is much more than grades and degrees. You see some of the most successful people dropped out of school. Do something you love and you will never fail at it.Nah. This doesn't ruin your life. And you can still get an MBA. Don't let small things get to you like this where you bring out the "S" word. You will be fine!All the successful people achieve things through non traditional means. I wouldn’t worry too much. Just focus on the work you love and that passion will set you apart.What’s your nameFrom all the details he gave you should be able to figure it out - founder of acqucoLol I think I ended with like 4 Ws and an F — the F was just me forgetting to submit the paperwork to drop it.  I really didn’t get my act together until after college.

I didn’t get a T1 consulting gig (or T2 or T3, did get fairly far interviewing for a T3 one in NYC though) but jumped a round for two years as a independent SQL consultant learning a shit ton — never really found an MBA useful, although I guess if you want two more years of traveling and partying — I had enough for a lifetime :) .  Ended up in startups and shit until the pandemic, then joined a company as a cofounder 

FWIW I hate PR BS, (I had my PR person spend 30 minutes on it) but I was in that Forbes 30 under 30 list if that gives you any motivation.I'm getting my MEM from Cornell (didn't want an MBA, not relevant for my goals) and I 100% agree with this comment. Work experience has made all the difference for me throughout my classes. The concepts click way better than they would have fresh out of undergrad.        

GPA matters for the first job, maybe, and there are thousands of companies that don't care about it at all. Personally, when I'm looking at resumes for candidates, I don't look at GPA. I look at projects/extracurriculars/etc. I also look at schools and Cornell's name holds a lot of weight on its own. I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you if a candidate put a GPA on their resume, let alone what it was.     

OP, I understand how stressed you must be at the moment. It sucks feeling that way and I've been there. But you can and will get through this. Take some deep breaths and a mental health day or two. You can get back on track for your goalsJust got my MBA here at Cornell. First of all, you should get your MBA after working a few years. Really advise against going straight into an MBA program. More importantly two Ws are not gonna impact your chances that much as long as your overall GPA is alright, even so your undergrad gpa does not matter all that much.

Your gpa won’t matter with the majority of employers also. You are graduating from Cornell. That’s enough for most people. 

Your really stressing over nothing my friend.

TLDR: when you enter the working world you will realize no one cares about your gpa. The best it will do is help you land your first job. After that it’s not important. It’s less important for business school then your work experience.Suck it up and hit them backThe Academic Support Program is minimal but it gives students a chance to meet weekly with someone.  Not very robust but better than nothing .  Use all resources and advocate strongly . … unless of course the reason for your grades was sex drugs and rock and roll.  Even so, you have learned something …not sure what , but something.  Try to spend some energy this summer in reflection —- not suicidal rumination please!  Try to talk with people in addition to your parents, who may be a bit ….. heated emotionally  about this.  Get sone perspective and come back strong and focused.  Force the college to work with you if you are ready and willing to work yourself .  Good luck !!!BRUHHH.  I used to work with faculty at Cornell, some of whom would lose their jobs after being denied tenure, and you know what we'd talk about?  Cornell is like the NY Yankees of academia... so what if things didn't work out as planned during your time here, there's a bunch of other \[teams\] that'd love to have you!  Maybe you didn't have what it takes to keep the pinstripe uniform -- not everyone does, in fact, most don't -- but that doesn't mean there aren't a ton of other paths and opportunities to \[play baseball\].  


(also.  by the by, i have never once in my life heard of an employer checking transcripts.  for many, a credential check is part of a thorough background check, but that's only to the extent of confirming that you have the degree(s) you claim you have.)I had 2 Ws in undergrad and was still accepted to Cornell grad schoolI’m going to be blunt here, because when I’m in bad mental spaces like that I woulda appreciated someone to kick me in the butt too. That being said:

If stupid shit like grades makes you feel suicidal, then you’re in for a rude awakening when you have to face actual problems in real life. 

Mope around for a day - fine. But tomorrow put it past you, think, and write out a plan to prevent it from happening again. Whether that be changing your long-term goals (academic or not), switching majors, or just making sure to study harder / get academic help in the future, just come up with a plan and stick to it.

Don’t be fucking dramatic. Your life isn’t ruined. Employers don’t give a shit. Keep working on high income skills you’re passionate about.

Fuck classes. Fuck grades - it’s really not that deep.Dude, nobody cares about your GPA. You are at Cornell. Just get out alive, and have fun.I have never had an employer ask for a transcript. This only happens with companies that require it for a security clearance investigation or for the Feds. I don't even put GPA on my resume, nor do I actually remember it. No one cares what your grades were in University.Everyone here gave great comments and I agreed with them all (except that troll) so I have nothing to add. Just want to say hang in there, you’ll be fine. Your life is not ruined! That’s a very tiny part of your life, don’t use a magnifying glass on it. 💪🏻Hey, I hope you are feeling a little better today.

GPA matters for the first job, maybe, and there are thousands of companies that don't care about it at all. Personally, when I'm looking at resumes for candidates, I don't look at GPA. I look at projects/extracurriculars/etc. I also look at schools and Cornell's name holds a lot of weight on its own. I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you if a candidate put a GPA on their resume, let alone what it was.

I’d start there.Smaller, lesser known club that I was in for 3/4 of my years so I have to pitch it: Cornell current. It’s a current events think tank - Basically you research current events and present them to the rest of the club and discuss, etc. they have weekly workshops for members to build public speaking skills, networking skills, research skills, etc. This is where I got like 98% of my public speaking abilities and it’s a very low-stakes, friendly environment. Also applications are way more lenient than other clubs (source: I was on e-board and we accepted almost everyone who applied and showed genuine interest)Felt that in my soul 😅 I rarely get shy talking to people one-on-one, but yeesh..Totally relatable. I need something or someone to bring me out of my comfort zone. Any form of public speaking will literally make me shit my pants. 😂There is a standup comedy club called Pun Intended. That’s pure public speaking right there. And it certainly helped me be more confident addressing audiences.Just show up to meetings!

Also, will it be safe to practice in the parking lot? I have seen some videos taken with the parking garage background but not sure if it is safe to do so.

Thank you!Gates Hall outdoor area was made for sk8rsThe little plaza outside Milstien is a really popular spot for skaters. Also the human ecology parking garage is super fun to just roll down on. Obviously be careful of the cars but it’s normally never full/busy.looking for guidanceIs a B-minus a "good" grade in Math 1920, Multivariable Calculus for Engineers? Please forgive my asking. My son says that many students fail that class. His intended major is Physics and I am concerned.The average for 1920 my freshman year was a B, so it is likely just below average. That is fine. It is a hard class and often hits people when they are just adjusting to college life.

Also, let your son be with his grades. At this point you should probably just rely on his own drive and let him make his own choices.Lady your son is in college, please stop micromanaging his grades and trust he’ll figure out his own pathDammit, Mom! You're embarrassing me on the subreddit!I think you should focus on supporting your son doing his best. Checking up on him in this way shows an attitude that might be counterproductive.i’d say it’s a tier below good, so “okay”. a b- isn’t anything to worry about…if he showed you the content covered at the end of the semester, i’m sure you’d understand why the course can be challenging for a lot of students. there aren’t many people who actually fail it tho.Tiger mom gangBoston?Is there a Cornell Boston GroupMe?More Than a FeelingIf there isn’t already you should make one - and include me :)I'm in Boston for the summer, pls include me as wellInclude me as well!Anyone in Ithaca?

Looking for some quiet & calm reading spots outside :-)Botanical gardens has various paths with benches. Beautiful and quiet. Just take bug spray!There's a little knoll behind Warren Hall, just east of Martha Van, that has a bench, lawn area, and shade trees.  Wander a little further in that area along the paths.  Comstock Knoll behind the Nevin Welcome Center is also a nice spot with some benches.  Down the trail behind Risley Hall into Fall Creek Gorge takes you to a nice area. If you don't mind the setting, City Cemetery off Stewart Ave can be secluded and tranquil.Personally I go to the arboretum more than the botanic gardens because there’s less people and parking is always freeIf you’re looking for close to campus, there’s a small Japanese garden behind the Johnson Art Museum that’s always pretty peaceful, if you don’t mind some slight noise from carsMinn's garden on Tower Rd in front of the Plant Science Bldg is a beautiful, peaceful little garden.  It has benches as well as a table with chairs at one end.  They plan on doing construction on the Plant sci building this summer so it could be less peaceful then normal.  There are a couple of nice resting spots at the top of BeeBe lake by the foot bridge.

During the summer most of the campus is quiet and nice. 

For a change of pace, if you're not carrying heavy books a bus ride to Robert Treman or Buttermilk Falls State Parks would be a nice (though probably not so quiet on the weekends)Depending on whether you’re superstitious, there’s a nice seating area on the steps behind llenrocSapsucker woodsGo to Beebee lake, there's a abandoned stair next to the bridge where you can walk down to sit by the lakeIs spectrum down in Ithaca or is it just me?Rebooted my router and it came backSeems to be downRebooted my router and it came backOrgo II and BiochemIs it possible to take both these classes in one semester?To be able to get enough time to prep for and take the MCATWell if it has to be done, it has to be done. More power to you, amigo!But whyAre you asking about autotutorial biochem? If so idk, but i don’t remember biochem I really using much aside from basic ochemOnly a Sith deals in absolutes.it's possible, but highly not recommended. I'm assuming youre premed, please be aware that there is absolutely no need to rush through and take the MCAT. you can take as many gap years as you need (the average accepted med student takes 2 gap years), so i really encourage you to slow down and take ur time to ensure you do well in both classes.

that said, if you really insist on doing this and are certain you will do well in both, pls do not take any other classes that are even remotely difficult next sem lol. best of luck friend!I did this while taking 21 credits (one liberal arts, rest were STEM). The thing is - I liked orgo, so honestly it didn't feel that bad (and the classes are very different content-wise). The one piece of advice that I will leave here is - DO NOT TAKE THE AUTOTUTORIAL IF YOU ARE ALREADY OVERLOADING ON CLASSES. I know it's tempting since it fits into a packed schedule, but you will by the middle of the course want to go back in time and punch the idiot responsible for enrolling in a class that takes far too much time when you don't have any.I took both (not in the same semester tho) and I think it's doable. Biochem is memorization-heavy and orgo 2 is more application based. Both are def tough classes, just doesn't really overlap in terms of skills needed. You can spend as much or as little time on Orgo as you need really.i didn’t do it but i know someone who did (3580 + auto biochem)! it was difficult and time consuming but doable if you can manage your time well. definitely wouldn’t add anything else that’s too difficult to that workload thoughYou can definitely do it. Just gotta manage your time well. Lmk if u need anyt like resources or stuff :Dabsolutely possible  
but for your sanity and well being, i really hope you aren't taking many more (hard) classes that same semester.I took both those courses (auto biochem btw), biostats, orgo lab, and an English class in the same semester. So it’s def possible but you will have to spend a lot of time studying which will affect your ability to participate in extracurriculars, sleep, or your social life (pick your poison).I just took 3580 and auto together. Was not bad a majority of the time, but I like orgo. Near the end of semester during metabolism units it was a lil rough, but do-able. I definitely wouldn’t say 3580 is a prereq since your understanding of mechanisms from 3570 and beginning of 3580 is more than enough to help you with the concepts covered in biochem.Well if it has to be done, it has to be done.

Sci-fi, horror, and historic drama used to be my fav. I tried Bertolucci a bit during the spring break, and he was my rare exception. But as I ran out of all the movies on available recommendation lists, I turned to this New York spectacle last night. 

I thought his works would be great for a supper not because they're enthralling, but boring to the extent that you may have some background noise when you eat. I was wrong. His often-ridiculed babbling sounds so fun. And the plot is full of humorous twists and turns. I'm not going to mention the name of the one I watched since it'd stir up an unnecessary quarrel about which one is his best work. But yeah, unexpectedly, I converted from David Lynch, James Wan, and Martin Scorsese to Allen.Annie Hall is such a modern film..
