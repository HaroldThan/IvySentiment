Has anyone taken machine learning taught by Verma?Culpa review got me really interested in the course, but it seems that it's one of the most difficult in compsci department.

Is it a terrible idea to take it without knowing Artificial intelligence? I have math/stats background, but not so much on compsci aspect.Thanks! Is it possible to do well in it without knowing ai though?Yes, it is.

The AI course is more of an overview of AI and covers many topics. There‚Äôs a module or two on ML, though, but that‚Äôs not the focus of the class.Machine learning at Columbia is very much an applied statistics course. So it won‚Äôt be simply running through tutorials of Python libraries.

The Artificial Intelligence course could be a good precursor course to give insight into how ML may be. But ML is definitely more in depth wrt math.Oh thanks! I have a concern that the prof is not so approachable. Is it true??I agree that the class is very difficult and in my opinion excessively so. However I found Verma to be very approachable in office hours and a great person overall.Very true. He just has a very blunt style where it's basically his way or the highway. Only take the class if you have 20 hours a week to spend on this to do medium well. In the spring course, something like an 18% was a B- on the midterm and a 28% was a B- on the final. Yes there is a curve but you can imagine just how hard the actual class is - if you want to have a social life and do anything else but stress out about this class, pick something else. Very statistics and math heavy, very little computer science.Thanks. I think that's what it matters, but some review seems to indicate that he's not so approachableOops do you mean 18 out of 100?Yes, I meant to add percentages, fixed.Ohh do you mean 18 people out of 100 get lower than B-?? Or, 18 points out of 100?18%. As in 18/100 points üòÇNo need to take AI. Expect the class to be hard thoughYes, it is.

Is it easier to just stick with a laptop? Is having a tablet worth it? Also does anyone have any laptop/tech recommendations.There is room but it‚Äôs not worth it unless you are a hardcore gamer, laptops are way more convenient especially since you‚Äôll want to go to the libraries and stuff. 

I got an iPad Air junior year and it‚Äôs a game changer. Taking notes on that beats physical notebooks by a mile. Get Goodnotes or Notability and the Apple Pencil. 

MacBooks have superior battery life and the cross connections with iPads/phones is really useful so if you can go for that it seems best. I work in finance though so I have a Windows laptop which is fine too. This depends on your price range, no need to get super fancy.A laptop is best, you want to be able to take notes and augment the slides from lectures etc.Getting a laptop means you can carry it around with you to classes or the library, so that's probably the better option. You can still bring a monitor for the dorm, but that's a matter of personal preference -- know that the convenience of having a monitor right there might bind you to your room (esp. if you already spend a lot of time on your PC at home), which may or may not be what you want. As someone who just finished freshman year, I personally loved going to the library to do work at night because I could bring a friend or still see people I knew if I went alone, which definitely helped me strengthen friendships.is columbia near lots of things to do as a young post-grad?*disclaimer that i know this is a relatively dumb question but i'm trying to get an idea if living around Columbia is a good/bad idea*
i'm a recent grad from a big and very walkable city that's currently planning on moving to morningside heights soon (planning on grad school). ive been to ny many many times but never actually lived there and the people i know who have lived there went to nyu/lived downtown. do columbia students generally stick to the morningside heights  area or do people take the up to 45 minute train ride to downtown to do things regularly? i went to undergrad in an area with good public transit and that long of a ride would generally not be reasonableto do regularly. i have no specific attachment to downtown at all, it's just more of what i know, so im just curious if how far uptown columbia is isolates the student body from parts of the city that have lots to do for young people. please tell me if i'm totally off base, i don't have any sources to ask for this type of info so i undersrand i may be totally off. thanks for any advice!It‚Äôs not a terrible place to be post-grad, since the rents are cheaper and overall Morningside Heights is a nice place to live. There are a few bars and great restaurants in the area, but most young people will take the train downtown for more of the action. 45 minutes to get downtown is a bit overblown: you can easily get to Times Square/Midtown in 20, NYU area in 30ish. That‚Äôs a very reasonable train commute for ‚Äúfun‚Äù for most young post-grads. I‚Äôd definitely characterize it for post-grads who want to be a little separated from the action and live somewhere quieter (and possibly cheaper) compared to living somewhere like East Village.Studio Housing Guest PolicyHi All! I need to make a decision by 12 am tonight about choosing a studio off-campus at Columbia. I need to know if there is any guest policy for residents living in studios before I can put a deposit down. If anyone has this information it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!Looking for Tenant for studio right across Morningside parkHi, i am currently looking for a new tenant to take over my lease. Its really spacious studio that you have to share bathroom(has separated shower booth and toilet) with other male. Furnished with desk, bed and closet as well as fridge and a small kitchen. Its located right across morningside park on Manhattan Ave for only $1325. If anyone is interested please hit me a message. Thanks!What interesting things should I look for on Campus?I‚Äôll be touring campus very soon, what things should I be on the look out for?Not the worst recommendationWeed dealersIm looking for things to write about in my supps. Something I cant find by just browsing the internet.Don‚Äôt rely on others to find you supp content, advisors can see through that like glass. 

Not to be a grouch and useless, here are some ideas that may give you some direction. Think about what would actually make you want to come here. Do you like the bubble in Manhattan idea? Or do you want something more integrated in the city? Is there a particular club you like in HS that Columbia has? If so, try going to one of the meetings (I doubt any club would really mind, unless you act weird about it). Into film photography? Try checking out the darkroom. ie figure out what‚Äôs important to you (besides it being Columbia) and go see that.This world has become so boring. Peace and respect to your app process though, OP.You should write about how much research you want to do, that's what Columbia seems to be most oriented toward in my experience. I think being specific would be best here too (type of research, specific labs, specific professors)The second paragraph is what I was looking for. Thank you.

Im not looking for others to help me write my supps, im asking if someone has a favorite spot on campus or building or cafe or somethingThank you..?Ill be writing about research some how regardless as it is one of my ECs, but I want to reference specific things like, say, what aspect of a building or a lab I liked. Something that shows attention to detailIt‚Äôs not about the individual things to see, touring a campus is about getting the feel for a place. There are all types of colleges, Columbia is rare in that it is an urban school but still very much has a bubble in which it exists. Other urban campuses feel much more integrated into the city. Like you can look at some of the other College buildings in Manhattan and you wouldn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre a school except for the signage.Thank youBe on the lookout for which library is best for you to study/relax and conveniently located near the buildings your classes located at etc.I like the terrace outside the law school.Alright thanks![Postcrypt Coffeehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcrypt_Coffeehouse), the student-run music venue/art gallery hidden in the basement of St. Paul's Chapel. 

Although, if you are visiting in the summer, you may find it difficult to visit Postcrypt or see much outside the standard tour. Student life is active mostly during the fall/spring season. Summer campus is mostly alumni reunion week, undergrads doing lab research, or pre-college immersion program kids.Are you sure you're not conflating that with the [cyclotron](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/nyregion/20atom.html#:~:text=The%20machine%2C%20known%20as%20a,subatomic%20particles%20and%20split%20atoms.) in the basement of Pupin, used to split the atom intentionally for the second time in human history just days after Denmark, much of which was removed a little over a decade ago?New plans for this SeptemberThere we goIsn't it just a tokamak?

Is this the case for Columbia as well?Imagine paying $10,000 to take a class taught by a 20-year-old.Fuck that so hardDefinitely no courses taught by *undergrad students* lol.Other than uni writing, are there courses that are taught entirely by graduate students or undergrads?My 3000 level history course in the spring was taught by a phd student. It is likely that phd students also teach other courses but it is not common.

No classes are taught by undergradsI think discrete math was taught by a phd student at one point (not anymore though). I haven‚Äôt heard of undergrads teaching a course though.ArtHum, likely MusicHum as well.I think University Writing is taught by a lot of grad students, but I dont know if this is the case for all the sections.A lot of core classes are taught by grad students completely. Not so much CS, Math, and sciences. But in those classes, most of the grading will be grad students.I've had some classes in which TA graded everything but lectures were done by professors.How about CS,stat and math?Probably there are some in CS for upper level classes (I'm not sure)

But for stat and math, all courses are taught by professors/lecturersNo, some of the calc classes are taught by phd students. And I would be shocked if the *upper* level courses in any department were taught by anything but professors. It's extremely rare if it happens at all. If there are grad students teaching, it's almost certainly in the more introductory classes. To answer the OP's question, you might have graduate instructors in core classes, beginner and intermediate language classes, calc classes, and maybe labs for intro science classes (if you need to take them). I haven't heard of phd students being the primary lecturers in stat or CS classes (discussion sections at most).Yeah, i forgot about calculus. For cs, I know one course that has phd student involved as a dual instructor, but it's a survey type of course i assumeUpper level PhD students have taught cs theory and discrete math regularly before.Yes some courses in humanity are taught by grad students Negative, at least not to my knowledge. All my professors were graduates (not students) and held Ph.Ds, albeit I do know of some TAs who were undergraduates.Yeah I don't think there are classes exactly like what you describe. There are some classes based on the presentations of your classmates though, for example, like undergrad seminars in math, which you can kinda say are taught by classmates (probably fellow seniors), but there's still a professor involved in the class.

Edit: There are also likely recitation and discussion sections for many of the CS and math classes held by TAs where they teach/review content for the main class, so I guess that also might count.Depends on the department. Philosophy has some that are taught only by graduate students.There are some taught by PhD students but in my experience they have all been fantastic, and often better than profs because they were more approachable and personable since they weren‚Äôt a famous tenured big dick Professor (in my experience at least). I‚Äôve also had TAs who were complete clowns so I guess the experience varies a lotESP. Taught entirely by undergrads. Technically speaking not a class. It's Pass Fail only but it does show on your transcript as one credit.I had several courses, including stem courses, taught by Grad students. To name a few: 
Calculus 1, Computer Science Theory, Contemporary Civilization, Art Hum, Music Hum, Lit Hum, The Social World, Elementary Spanish, Sociology of Education. These were courses taught entirely by grad students, with no other professors teaching. 
Many of these professors were close to finishing their dissertation though.Fuck that so hardImagine paying $10,000 to take a class taught by a 20-year-old.My 3000 level history course in the spring was taught by a phd student.

Talk to the FA office.This will be hard to get an answer to since none of us have access to financial aid info outside of the same internet resources you have access to. So, I'll just tell you what happened to me with financial aid and loans.

I started with an 18k a year scholarship and got a 6k boost (24k) for year 2 and then a 5k boost (29k) for year 3, my last. They also gave out some covid bucks (about 3k a year for my last 2 years, I think) but I'm not sure if they will keep doing that. I also got a full pell grant each year (about 5k each year, I believe). I worked a job to pay my non-tuition expenses and took out loans to cover the rest of my tuition (roughly). I also had some savings that I dipped into and I worked an internship that paid relatively well for one summer.

I ended with 33k in loans.

\--edit--

The amount of boosts in scholarship happened because I kept a high GPA (>3.9)GS has very little aid and students foot most of the bill.  Expect maybe 15k a year in scholarship, it's merit-based, not need-based.  GS aid is improving, but most students either come from wealthy families or use veteran benefits.Very much depends on your situation. If you have a spouse paying for the majority of your rent and living expenses, it's not too bad. If you have to pay for your living expenses and your planning on going full time, it's going to be a lothttps://cc-seas.financialaid.columbia.edu/estimate-cost
    
also interesting, at an average total cost of 83k, and average award of 61k, the average net cost is 22k out of pocket:

but you‚Äôre not here to be average‚Ä¶.     
Edit: sorry, read that as transferring from GS to the college, so may not exactly apply.Graduate Housing Selection (Law School)I just got admitted Columbia's Law School and just had my graduate housing selection yesterday. The only options available are rooms for Lenfest Hall with an average rent of $2500 a month, which exceeds the average rent on their promotional material, website, and grant aid information (Room and Board cost of $21,600 per school year). I haven't selected a room yet for this reason.

Is there anything I can do, such as request general graduate housing or ask if there is any availability  in other law school housing building? I applied about two weeks before the housing deadline, perhaps everything is taken?

&#x200B;

Thank you for any advise.That‚Äôs amazing! When time of day do the housing units typically get updated? Congrats on getting into Columbia! ü•≥All throughout business hours, I think! So I checked often from 8am-5pm from Monday through Thursday. Congrats to you too!Oh wow thats awesome!

I'm super grateful for this post because I was worried that waiting until Monday morning would be too risky lolHold out hope. The same thing happened to me a few weeks ago when my housing appointment opened up on a Friday‚Äîthere were only $2500 studios left. Check back throughout the next week because the housing office adds more units everyday. I started off with only 13 available units when my appointment started and 55 units when my appointment ended the following Thursday.All throughout business hours, I think!

Not sure if they are being held up by some courses which haven't published all grades yet - saw some bad things about Fundies grades. Also, is the threshold still 3.6, or is it increased?Ah got it, thanks!The deans list won‚Äôt be published until the end of the PDF uncover deadline, which is a few weeks into the Fall semester.Ah got it, thanks!Student ContributionOk so the 2,400 student contribution that every student has‚Ä¶I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone? Is it an actual bill that we have to pay or just an estimation of out of pocket expenses a student will pay throughout their year. I‚Äôve heard both cases and would love to know which one it is! 
Thanks!Where does it go then?I feel like skieurope‚Äôs answer might be a bit confusing in how it‚Äôs worded but basically you do owe Columbia that $2400 one way or another. It is NOT for general living expenses or travel or whatever (I think that‚Äôs another line on ur fin aid statement, something like ‚Äúoutside expenses‚Äù? Idk the exact wording)

But that $ doesn‚Äôt have to explicitly come from your bank account. It could be from your parents, outside scholarships, whatever. But that money goes to Columbia explicitlyIt's simply a line item on your FA package. Your bill will simply show how much Columbia wants from you this semester. They do not care how you juggle funds to pay the amount owed.

Specific questions on your situation should be directed to the FA office.Ahh I see. Any ideas on why Columbia still hasn‚Äôt waived this fee yet? Other peer institutions (stanford, duke, penn, etc.) have removed their mandatory fee to make it more accessible to student that are highly-aidedYou are not billed specifically for the student contributionNot everyone, but most have 2400 contribution. However some, including me, got into specific scholars programs (about 10 SEAS and 10 CC students per year) and have an increased scholarship which doesn't include any student contribution or on-campus job.I feel like skieurope‚Äôs answer might be a bit confusing in how it‚Äôs worded but basically you do owe Columbia that $2400 one way or another.

Flights to Libson are really cheap right now ($391 Delta) roundtrip from NYC to Libson. The airbnbs are really cheap, 31 dollars a night, and I would be wanting to share it. The dates would be after Christmas (1/9-1/16). I would love to have something to look forward to after Fall semester ends!

Let me knowWait deadass like only 391 dollars round trip???Lol, why the hell on earth would someone pay a stranger for a trip?Sure thing buddy! Especially if you are paying. Seriously though a group trip to Europe would be fantastic.Sounds fun!Apparently people do lol.

https://www.hostelworld.com/blog/travelling-with-strangers/I went to Portugal for winter break a few years ago (pre-covid!) Absolutely wonderful. I can't go with you this time, but I definitely recommend going to the beaches in the south as well as Sintra (right outside of Lisbon.) Also, if you drink alcohol try the green wine for sure and they have pastries there that are really good. Obvs the Port wine is what they're known for, but green wine is SO good. Lisbon is one of the least expensive cities I've visited in Europe and it was sunny and not too cold in January (definitely not too touristy, which was so nice compared to the packed streets of Paris and Rome.) Also, the language barrier was barely present--DO NOT attempt to speak Spanish in place of Portuguese. They HATE that. Spain is their long-time rival. Speak English instead if you can't communicate in Portuguese. Most people interacted with in Lisbon spoke English pretty well.
Not to question your plans to find a travel buddy, but you could also travel by yourself. I've done that a bunch and I meet people more easily that way--usually in bars or clubs.

NYC really blew me away when I first came to ColumbiaA fool and his money are soon partedI honestly dont think any sub 2200 option exists after COVID. My rent is 4500 for a 1b. My landlord made an absurd rent raise this year and I had been trying to find a new apartment for two months. Anywhere near Columbia, all vacant spots are gone instantly right at moment they become available. So I ended up renewing my current lease  and paying the absurd rent. 

To go for 2000-ish rent near Columbia you must find yourself a roommate. Also brokers can help a lot as they can secure a vacant room before it‚Äôs open to the public (but only trust someone you personally know, because a bad broke can easily cost you hundreds of dollars).That‚Äôs going to be tough to find right now, in your budget you should probably be looking to the north of the neighborhood or to the east of morningside park, or searching for roommates. Personally I pay 2900 for a 1 bedroom (which I split with a roommate, so my share is 1,450).Look around 103rd and West End.  It's a 10-15 min walk to campus and there's a subway stop right there.

I was wondering if anyone has any insights into how to get research assistant positions specifically in the social sciences (econ/poli-sci etc.) My approach so far has been to cold email a bunch of profs, but that hasn't been particularly succesfull thus far.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any ideas on how to go about finding such opportunities, that'd be super appreciated!Attend every class, go to office hours, develop a relationship with the professor. Ask them questions about their research. Do this for a couple semesters to show interest. 

Research for a professor is a business built on publications. Like any other business, they‚Äôre going to need new hires to be familiar with their line of work and not completely green. Best of luck!I'm speaking about the Econ department. The first time is a bit hard, then it becomes easier as you work with more people. For the first time, you've two conventional options:

1. Contact a professor who knows you‚Äì‚Äìyou've taken a class with them, or whatever.
2. Every semester, the department posts a list of all available RA positions in the department's website‚Äì‚Äìthese postings are either made by grad students or by faculty members. 

When you send an email, try to briefly show your familiarity and interest in the topic‚Äì‚ÄìI do not recommend sending the same email to everyone.

Best of luck!Literally just email a bunch of professors and ask if they're taking students and say you're interested in working with them. Cold emailing is very underrated. It will yield results. Not everyone will respond, but if you email like 10 people, someone will probably respond.It you‚Äôre in Econ the best way is to take a class with a prof you want to do research for an show that you‚Äôre 1) smart 2) actually interested in their stuff / Econ broadly. You should also have coding skills assuming you want to do empirical stuff.

Cold emailing could actually work if you‚Äôre able to signal in the email that it‚Äôs actually worthwhile to work with you. The econ dept also posts a bunch of RA jobs at the start of each semester.Cold emails work if you email a lot. Otherwise, you just have to get to know professors by attending their classes and office hours.Running near Columbia UniversityHi! I was wondering if any of you would recommend running routes near Columbia University? I am not super familiar with the neighborhood, and so I am looking for routes that are safe for early morning runs. Would the northern part of Central Park/Morningside Park/ Riverside Park (\~110th St.) be good and safe choices? Thanks!Riverside Park is pretty good. Especially with the greenery and the river view.   


I have been going there for early morning runs for a while now. As for safety, it feels pretty safe based on my experience.Central Park is safe and probably the most interesting place to go. You have some wooded paths, the main loop, and paths around the reservoir and Harlem Meer. If it's actually dark out, stay out of the woods (mostly because it's extremely dark once you get off the path). There will be runners there even after dark or before dawn in the summer. Riverside Park is also safe, but is flat and kind of boring. You can't really do much beyond a simple out and back straight along the river. It's nice enough to do once or twice per week, but it gets old very quick. Both places will have lots of runners/bikers/dog walkers early in the morning. Morningside park doesn't really have anywhere to run and it's close enough to northwest Central Park that there's no reason to pick it. It's technically safe once the sun comes out, but it's basically on the side of cliff. It's not really a place to run.Riverside Park is the best, I really love it.  Tons of runners.  I've spent a lot of time there and have never felt unsafe.

Northern Central Park is okay.  Morningside Park is terrible for anything other than running stairs.  You don't want to be in either after dark.Like many others said, Riverside is better and safer in my experience than both the north part of Central Park, and Morningside. Avoid Morningside unless it‚Äôs the middle of a well-lot day and I would stay off of the upper trails because much of it is out of view. Lots of violence and crime happens there.

I would also recommend only running south in Riverside unless it is the middle of the day, the sections to the north of 125th get a little sketchy.100% Riverside park should be your go to. Safe and you can run as much as you like. Central Park is also nice but a Lil far from Columbia.Riverside Park is good. Central Park if I have more time on my hands.Riverside --> 96th st entrance onto hudson greenway --> uptown, there's an exit around 125th st, can go further up or loop back. 

&#x200B;

Central park, so many routes, Google will help you here but getting around the reservoir is always fun because it just feels so much more open than any other part of the area.-Riverside Park

-You could run down to Central Park

-Broadway

-Morningside Park if it's not dark out, but it's kinda small

-Dodge fitness center has treadmills and an indoor track if it's too hot/coldRiverside is a cool place to runDon't forget going north along riverside, that can mix it up if you're used to going south. While going north, if you track about a block east of the river path, there will be a trail entrance under a bridge; that trail goes far and it's really pretty. You pop out next to the water. I also like riverbank state Park for running on a soft surface (track and turf field, not too crowded). Riverside all up/down as well as the trail I mentioned have a nice soft surface for most of the way that runs along the side of the path.Startups - searching for CTO/technical cofounderSearching for CTO/Technical co-founder:

DM/email @ ak6962@nyu.edu if you are interested and want to know more!Coffee Tips for my Broke Columbia Folks :)Hello everyone!

&#x200B;

Wanted to let you know that PRET, (coffee place across the st from main entrance to CU,) offers a subscription service for coffee that's $30/month for 5 coffees per day. Including lattes, cold brew, etc. You can even add syrup. Coffee in NYC is so expensive. Joe Coffee is like 7 dollars for a latte on campus and that's kinda ridiculous. I have an espresso machine at home, and I can tell you that this is almost as economical as making your own coffee if you drink around 2 cups p/day. Wanted to give a heads up for my caffeine deprived friends ;)

&#x200B;

\*edit fellow broke columbia folksI‚Äôd add a disclaimer to this post:

When you start drinking this crap every day for about 4 months, it literally tastes abominable. I forgot what real good coffee tasted like until I went off this pass. Also be prepared for insane lines that take up 10-15 minutes of your morning. They also always ran out of stuff after 12:00 somehow. No alternative milks, no cups, no ICE?? Horrid. I would recommend this pass only if you lived near a different Pret.

I get not wanting to pay also ridiculous prices for coffee elsewhere, but I‚Äôve started buying large gallons of cold brew (I love Stok!) which is usually $3 lasting me like 3 days (I drink an abnormal amount of coffee) or go to any Blue Java (comes to around $2-4 dining dollars).

Last but not least, I‚Äôd try out the Pret pass for a while, but not forever. Despite, my complaints and negative reviews of it, because it def doesn‚Äôt break the bank it‚Äôs worth a shot. Plus the pass includes a free month of the benefits so you can cancel before it charges you. Best of luck my fellow caffeine addicts!Great point!!I would add that they also have some promotions such as first two (or maybe just one, not sure) months for free when signing up for the service. This was the promotion in September at least. Moreover, the cheapest plan is $20/month.Good to know in a pinch. Thank you! Horrible coffee is still coffee ha.It's borderline awful, but for 25 cents you can get coffee in the german department office.I do make my own.

Was it worth it?specifically engineering but this can be answered by any studentI don't know that you will find a lot of transfer from Cornell to Columbia, I did my undergrad at Cornell and now am in grad school here. Not really sure why you'd transfer? I think the caliber of classes and research is very similar. In my experience in a small engineering department, Cornell was better organized and had more support available, I think partially due to larger size. I would generally say that transferring is not a great idea unless there is something specific you know you would get at another university that you don't get at your current institution, for example if there is a major you want that doesn't exist at your school. Columbia does have a bit more of a "liberal arts" thing than Cornell, but you have access to any classes you want in the Art's school, so if you wanted to craft a very rounded course load you could. I personally liked that I could just take mostly STEM classes. I knew a couple transfer students who really struggled to make friends because a lot of people form super close friendships in their first year, so would warn that it can be hard socially. Why are you considering transferring?I did u never responded[deleted]I did u never respondedRubenstein fundies curve?Anyone knows how the grading happened?

(Non-major)I‚Äôm a senior poli sci student interested in studying the global economy. Technically, Econ 101 is a requirement for the global economy in the spring, but I‚Äôve learned about the intro Econ stuff at this point through my other classes. I still want to take Global Economy but Econ 101 is a pre-reqFrom the department webpage: "Course prerequisites are strictly enforced. Prerequisites must be taken before the course, not after or concurrently." Also, I have trouble believing that non-econ classes teach a sufficient amount of the principles material. *Maybe* you got the basic intuition, but the technical jargon and models (for example, aggregate supply and demand models) are almost certainly not covered elsewhere. Even if you could slip through the cracks during enrollment, you'd be far behind the curve. The class will be more technical than you expect, you're not just doing a bunch of readings. You'll be mostly covering mathematical/economic models that explain phenomena in the real worldBy any chance, did you take AP Micro and Macro? If so, you do have the pre-reqs.Anyone at Columbia going to MCR's Reunion concert in NYC.Specifically, any Columbia class of 2026 students going to this concert?

Will PM you.CP grade fundiesHas anyone gotten a cp grade for fundies? I‚Äôm freaking out and don‚Äôt know what it means. Does anyone have a clue?Weird...I got a real grade. This class smhhttps://www.college.columbia.edu/facultyadmin/grading

For the Fall of 2021, the mark of CP (Credit Pending) signifies that instruction and/or grading in a course have not been completed. The grade of CP is a temporary transcript notation and will be replaced by an evaluative letter grade once  instruction and grading are completed.  Satisfactory progress by the student is implied.Email alias helpSo I set up my Cu email and changed it to an alias. However, whenever I try the alias out and send an email to it, it says it doesn't exist. I changed everything in my [uni@columbia.edu](mailto:uni@columbia.edu) acc so that when I send an email, it sends from the alias and it works fine. But replying or emailing the alias sends a google prompted email stating that the email I'm trying to reach doesn't exist. Any tips?yes hello this is tech support have you tried turning it off and back on againI've set up the alias too but can't log in using that.Intro to Applied Math/ Physics 1403Does anyone know which textbook Prof. Yuan He uses for Intro to Applied Math (E2101)? Also, does anyone have the syllabus for that class? Trying to get a jump on some of the material before the semester starts. 

For physics 1403 with Charles Hailey, does anyone know if he uses a textbook, or if any textbooks are helpful? Is it the Halliday Resnick Walker textbook that 1401 and 1402 use or no? I have to re-up my WileyPLUS subscription fairly soon, and it would be nice to know if I didn't actually have to spend another hundred dollars to access a textbook I won't use. Thanks!Textbook for apma 2101 is Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 10th edition, William E. Boyce and Richard DiPrima
John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Pm me if you want the full syllabusTransfer credits from community college/summer courses?I'm trying to figure out if I take community college courses over the summer, if I'd be able to transfer/use those as credits at Columbia. 

Edit: Found this page, which says we can possibly get up to 6 credits for classes taken after high school but before starting at Columba: [https://bulletin.columbia.edu/columbia-college/regulations/#placementadvancedstandingtext](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/columbia-college/regulations/#placementadvancedstandingtext)

Still wondering about the process... If anyone's done this before, can you speak to how easy or strict they were? The page says it's up to the advising dean to make a determination. Also, wasn't sure if they'd accept an online class.cool, yeah that's the case! Do you happen to know if a course taken online would count too? I've heard some conflicting things.ask your advisorOnline classes will not be accepted, since Columbia itself is not online this summer.yeah unfortunately we don't get assigned an advisor until way latergood to know, thanks.as long as you havent started at columbia yet then yesask your advisorOnline classes will not be accepted, since Columbia itself is not online this summer.yeah unfortunately we don't get assigned an advisor until way latergood to know, thanks.cool, yeah that's the case!

Are there future veterininiars studying here? I know Columbia has no vet school, but I read they offered vet students an externship to gain experience. Is that still a thing? Would Columbia even accept a community college student who wants to major in biology there and then go to another university for vet school?Thank you!I know someone who went on to vet school at UC Davis after attending CU. The transfer process is definitely competitive, but CC students do come to Columbia and Columbia students can go on to vet school. Not sure about the internship experience through Columbia specifically, but NYC is a great place to get experience in so many fieldsThank you!How do I login using my CU email alias?I recently changed my email alias and I'm trying to show that alias when I login to my email but it keeps using my uni ID whenever I login.  Any tips on how?You can send and receive email from your alias but the account is still your uni@columbia.eduI don't know about alias, but I used [this method](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en) to setup sending email from my alias as default.

  
You also might need to setup your signature too for the alias in the settings. Should be easy to find.Are prerequisites strictly enforced during enrollment period at Columbia?Hello, I am an incoming sophomore transfer to Columbia GS and I am going to declare cs as soon as possible. I want to take the CS4775 Causal Inference and CS 4731 Computer Vision class. Would it be possible for me to take these this fall?Thank you so much for your help! Excuse me but do I have to wait until senior year to take CV?yeahhhhhh welcome to cs at columbia. the vision and graphics track isn't even an actual possibility since they haven't offered necessary classes for the track (like computer animation) for multiple semesters now. it's pretty sadI‚Äôm upper level CS classes, you can‚Äôt just enroll in the class. Even the first person to register is put on a waitlist, which instead of being a numbered queue is ‚Äúinstructor controlled‚Äù. Sometimes there is a HW zero that everyone does and the highest scorers are admitted up to the class max. Sometimes they just admit people according to seniority and other factors. 

Because of this system, it will be really hard to slip through the cracks and enroll in an upper level CS class for which you don‚Äôt have the prerequisites. You could *potentially* make your case as a transfer, if you have comparative prereqs already on your transcript, but you‚Äôd really have to sell yourself to both your academic advising dean *and* the professor of the class. 

Why don‚Äôt you just want to take the prereqs first?Thank you for your reply! So I might have to wait until senior year and even then it's not guaranteed?Thank you for your detailed reply! Excuse me but may I ask you some more questions? According to the syllabus computer vision and causal inference don't state the prerequisites clearly.. According to computer vision ii prereqs,

  
Computer vision is a diverse field, intersecting with math, physics, psychology, neuroscience, art, computer science, engineering, and philosophy. We have minimal prerequisites and the course staff will do its best to introduce concepts as we go along. The course will assume you know Python, basic linear algebra, and single variable calculus. You should be comfortable manipulating vectors and matrices, and be comfortable calculating derivatives and basic integrals. Knowledge in machine learning and statistics will be helpful, but not required.

  
In this case would my transcript showing that I got As in Cal1,2, linear algebra, intro to programming (not from Columbia though...) be enough? When instructor decides who to take in, does he or she consider the prerequisites the students have taken?Not suggesting you should do this but‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt get into a class which is a requirement for my major. So I bombed that professor and my department advisor with a endlessly lemmings train of emails. And eventually they were annoyed so much and added me into the class.I really don't know how people here are supposed to do that track if they simply don't offer the necessary classes? It's weirdThis is a question only the professor can answer. At Columbia, instructors have the freedom to conduct their classes as they see fit. You should feel free to email the professor, briefly explain your situation, and ask if you would be a good match for the class.So the good news is that prerequisites don't *really* matter for signing up for courses (unless you don't know prereq content at all and it's used heavily in the class). But the bad news is getting into popular upper level CS classes is hell, especially for underclassmen, so it's pretty likely you won't actually get a spot in them anyways. 

I'm not too sure how it'll work as a GS transfer, but I'm assuming you'll be grouped with other sophomores at registration so I wouldn't get your hopes up for getting into the classes (especially since registration has already happened for most students and I believe CV is popular enough that it is usually is filled with seniors, though someone can correct me on this cause I might be confusing it with another class).

Definitely go in with a bunch of backups, and don't get disheartened if you can't take them this year cause you have time!I did it all the time in the 1970s, but you need the professor or some authority to concuryeahhhhhh welcome to cs at columbia. the vision and graphics track isn't even an actual possibility since they haven't offered necessary classes for the track (like computer animation) for multiple semesters now. it's pretty sadI‚Äôm upper level CS classes, you can‚Äôt just enroll in the class.

Don‚Äôt need it anymore for my major so looking to get rid of it for a reasonable orice.I live in a very small rural town, and am looking to apply to Columbia next year. For people who came from similar places (or not) what are some of the biggest differences in city life?This is from safety to cost of living to social atmosphere, etc. What are your thoughts?One big thing for me has been the 24/7ness! Coming home from NYC I'm always shocked to remember that, oh yeah, if I'm hungry past 9pm I better get to the kitchen cause there sure isn't anything open. In NYC there's always a nearby grocery open, always a nearby diner open. We have 24 hour libraries in Columbia and we used to have a 24 cafeteria (hopefully again soon...?). The ability to make your own schedule is so nice, but very different.From rural KY, here for grad school. In such a big place, it still feels horribly lonely.I was walking with a friend on Broadway, heading for Riverside, just before the stabbing happened. I feel like I've never been able to process how lucky our timing was because it just got chalked up to "one of those New York things."someone said the 24/7ness, which honestly is the biggest difference, but i‚Äôll go a step further and say the constantness. like there‚Äôs always things happening around you and time doesn‚Äôt stop for anything or anyone. take for example, the recent subway shooting or the very unfortunate senseless stabbing in December; if either of these events happened in your small rural town or where i‚Äôm from, time would essentially come to a standstill and it‚Äôd be all we talk about for at least some while but here everyone just keeps moving at that brisk NYC pace like nothings happened. everything and everyone is constantly moving and you quickly have to learn to move in unison or you get left far behindBefore you apply, come visit, sit in on classes, stay with students.     Nothing we tell you will feel as real as finding out on your own.    
Also, I just missed my train, the fan belt on my car just broke, it‚Äôs a few blocks away but too far for me to show you, and I need five bucks to get home. If you give me your address, I promise I‚Äôll mail the money back.Born and raised in San Jose, did my undergrad in rural Oregon. 

I'd say the biggest difference between rural and city life is the pace. While I could walk outside my home in Oregon and get lost in conversation with friendly neighbors for an hour, that simply doesn't happen in NYC. People here have things to do and not enough time to do it, so everyone is in a hurry. There's the famous joke of a "New York minute", being the time it takes between a light turning green and the person behind you honking (probably 1-2 seconds). 

It's also noisy. If you are not used to sirens, you better adapt quickly, or you won't sleep. New York City has a population greater than some states in a fraction of the space, and because of that, there's a lot more noise. 

It's probably a bit more dirty. Going back to population density, that's just a natural byproduct. More people + smaller space = dirtier. 

The social atmosphere is definitely less inviting. I wouldn't say people are any less friendly in NYC than in Oregon, it's just that they're usually busy as mentioned earlier. If you find yourself being busy with them (like in class), they're perfectly pleasant (until you get to those legacy students or those born into extreme wealth). Most people at Columbia are friendly and well put together. When I was touring campus on my own time, I must've heard at least 5 different languages being spoken, it really is cool. 

I have a degree in criminology, so am happy to delve into the safety aspect too. The crime rate in NYC has had an uptick as of late, but is still a very safe city. There are certain boroughs and areas that have higher rates of incidents than others, but the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers have never been and will never be the victim of a crime. The general attitude of most students is that there is a "bubble" of a few blocks around campus where people feel very safe. Past that, and depending on which cardinal direction you're traveling, the chance that something happens rises, but is not "high" per se. 

If you have any questions, feel free to pm me.The bigger the place the more anonymous you are. That can make it lonelier if you‚Äôre not outgoing. 

Also, maybe it‚Äôs because of the pandemic but it‚Äôs not as crowded as many rural people think it is. Shit tons of people but friends back home think it‚Äôs as crowded as Times Square on every block. It‚Äôs not. Especially the farther from Midtown you get.There are people everywhere. It is busy pretty much everywhere, lines are long, *someone* will find out about *that quiet spot* and ruin it by posting it on insta if that hasn't already happened. It's also loud AF. Get some good ear plugs and noise canceling headphones. You will need them.

Also, *always* be aware of your surroundings. ALWAYS!!! Do not get into that subway car that only has one or two people in it (or that nobody is in) and absolutely try your hardest not walk around by yourself at night. Do not walk around with your wallet in hand or staring at your phone. The campus is generally safe, but that's probably because the students have street smarts. Keep your wits about you. This is not some small town where there is no crime. Also, do not smile at strangers and do not stare at the crazy-seeming, probably very mentally ill people (yes, sadly, there are many of those people.) You can smile at other Columbia students (duh), but random people on the street, NO! You will be asking for trouble. The best advice I can give you is put on your best "do not fuck with me" face. I do it. It seems to work. While I'm not trying to diminish peoples' stories of being assaulted on the subway because I'm sure it happens, I've never had that happen to me and I go on it pretty regularly. My general rule is that I *do not* take the subway late at night unless it's a pretty populated part of the line with other people around.

Pro tip: for quiet time in the city that also isn't scary (aka nighttime), I recommend getting up early on the weekends (or on Fridays too.) I found 2-3 early bird friends (a rarity, I know, but I'm *such* an early bird and so I found other early birds) and we'd go for nice quiet walks around the Upper West Side or to Central Park on the weekend mornings around 7-ish and then get coffee at 8/8:30 and then begin studying around 10am. So quiet. So nice. So not typical NYC. I love the quiet on the weekend mornings. Blissful.

On the surface, people in NYC are not friendly and do not really care about saying hi to you or how you're doing. Despite that,  people *are* friendly below that stony surface, but you need to put the effort in to get to know people because we're all super guarded. It comes with the territory. This is true on and off the Columbia campus. People are not warm and fuzzy. You will need to put in the work to make friends.

Some things that are great are *endless* good food and drink options of you're into that kind of thing. The art museums are among the best in the world and many are free. There is this GIGANTIC park called Central Park that makes you feel like you're not in a city when you're in it. Events are always happening / there is always something to do --this is a pro and con (I personally felt overwhelmed and did very little to venture far away from campus because I was very busy studying, but other people go all over.)I grew up in rural TX before moving to Houston, and then moving to NYC. Houston and NYC are quite different as cities go, though all big metroplexes have certain things in common. People mentioned the noise and that‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs helpful to have headphones or a book on the subway. Taxis are way more expensive than TV and movies would have you believe where everyone‚Äôs just constantly traveling around in a taxi. Public transportation is a double edged sword.

Many parts of the city smell like pee. Even the fancy parts of NYC. This is because there is urine everywhere, mostly from people and also animals, but using the bathroom in public is like playing Where‚Äôs Waldo with your bladder and an opportunity. Go before you head out anywhere.

NYC is more diverse than wherever you‚Äôre from, so don‚Äôt make assumptions about anyone. For example, you‚Äôll see someone who looks like they could be from your town, or the next one over‚Ä¶.but then you ask them a question and they respond in a language you‚Äôve never heard before. That‚Äôs general ‚Äúbeing human‚Äù advice, but especially in a city you‚Äôll encounter people from everywhere, and being all sorts of ways of human. Those people also have restaurants that serve the food of their people, and its usually delicious. Find them, eat and enjoy (the food‚Ä¶don‚Äôt go to New York and eat people). 

I made the mistake early on of holding the door for the person behind me at the Natural History Museum‚Ä¶.I ended up holding the door for so many people I eventually had to just look at a random dude coming through and say ‚Äúsorry partner‚Äù as I let the door go and walked away. But it‚Äôs always polite to give your subway seat up to a pregnant lady or someone who obviously needs it (not everyone does this, but many do).

There‚Äôs a lot of cool free stuff to do, especially when you‚Äôre young and don‚Äôt have kids of your own. Cultural festivals, Summer concerts, art shows, etc‚Ä¶ Go with groups of people and explore together. Join clubs/organizations and hangout with people.

Don‚Äôt cut through parks at night for safety reasons. I was always getting notices about people being mugged and stuff in Morningside Park, Riverside Park, etc. When you walk down a park staircase, those little tiny ziploc bags on the ground held drugs and not teeny sandwiches.That's interesting. Do you just like stare at the ground the whole time?? Also there's not many people to make eye contact with where I live, like the only viable means of transportation is by car.Lol what dude? How much you staring?This guy is exaggerating. As long as you don‚Äôt obviously stare like a creep, 99.99% of people aren‚Äôt going to do anything weird. In fact, it‚Äôs almost like you can look however you want‚Ä¶ because no one is making eye contact with you. 

The only strangers to talk to me are panhandlers, I just politely say ‚Äúsorry, can‚Äôt help you today‚Äù and keep walking. Unless I‚Äôm drunk, and then I‚Äôm generous lolYou just look past people. If you're walking towards someone on the street, whichever side you look to will be the side they expect you to pass on. If you're on the subway, look at your phone or a book. You can glance at folks, but don't look them in the eye**Do Not Make Eye Contact** 

Seriously. Don't make eye contact when you're traveling from place to place with anyone. In other parts of the US, it's just polite.

In NYC it's an invitation for strangers to tell you what you're doing wrong with your life/sexually harass you/scream about the Illuminati/etcThe anonymity. Nobody knows who you are. IMO that is a good thing as someone who is reserved and would rather people not do the "Hi! How are you?" routine and try to strike up a random conversation about nothing important.A lot of people will automatically assume you're a hick if you aren't from a coast or a city. Sometimes this is fine but can get tiring when it feels like everyone thinks you're a dumbass because you're from a rural town.I moved from a mountainous rural area on the coast with a population under 1,000 to NYC. In my home town, I had to drive an hour to get to a small city. Here's what I experienced:

* Apartments are 3-5x more expensive
* Safety is actually fine here, but you will get robbed if you don't pay attention or leave your stuff in the open like you would in the country
* People are not as friendly unless you get to know them. Then they're very friendly because they're all lonely from being on the move so much. 

&#x200B;

Overall, I love you opportunities of going to CU. I love the school. I like NYC. That said, I miss the mountains. I miss my parents.people around you everywhere all the time. that was a hard adjustment for me, and tbh i'm still not completely used to it. im from a rural area where everyone is pretty spread out, whereas here there is always, always someone there. even if you think you found some secluded spot at 3 in the morning to just chill, someone inevitably show up to the exact same spot. in my experience, having a single/a space you can be alone without someone around (i.e. your room) is very important.There's some great advice here on how to avoid standing out as "not from here"; another one is, don't walk around looking up at the tall buildings! 

One thing I love about New York is being able to get just about anywhere I want to go without getting in a car.I was walking with a friend on Broadway, heading for Riverside, just before the stabbing happened. I feel like I've never been able to process how lucky our timing was because it just got chalked up to "one of those New York things."This guy is exaggerating.

Good luck.I have a split leetcode account with some friends from back home and have found using different sessions for each user to be super helpful for keeping track of each of our progress.

Im at SEAS btw, so the core requirements are slightly different.

If there arent any specific ones for Columbia, I would love any personal recommendations on books to read.

Thanks!Figure out if you want to take CC, LitHum or global core. Global core I wouldnt really worry about yet, but if you pick CC or LitHum, you can do the reading for those ahead of the curve. CC is a sophomore class but you will probably still remember the booksLit Hum uses the Richmond Lattimore translation--that doesn't mean you shouldn't check out the Lombardo if you're interested.Personally I prefer the Lombardo translation because I think it‚Äôs more readable. I find it easier to get caught up in the plot and characters. So, I figure if you read that over the summer, you get a good base understanding of the Iliad, which will make understanding the Lattimore translation easier.Sounds sensible.Read the Stanley Lombardo translation of the Iliad. Its one of my all time favorites and I think it‚Äôs on the lit hum syllabusI‚Äôd check out Dostoevsky or Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. Both are pretty dense, but by the nature of this post I think you expected this already. I‚Äôd start with Crime and Punishment and One Hundred Years of Solitude, respectively. The latter happens to be my favorite book of all time (only perhaps challenged by The Kite Runner, which is also phenomenal but not part of the curriculum).

One last thing: they‚Äôre both best read in their original languages, those being Russian and Spanish. If you‚Äôre reading a translation, I‚Äôd recommend Pevear and Volokhonsky for Dostoevsky‚Äôs novels. Unfortunately I only read M√°rquez in Spanish, so I can‚Äôt recommend translators for him. Happy reading!Personally I prefer the Lombardo translation because I think it‚Äôs more readable. I find it easier to get caught up in the plot and characters.

I am trying to optimize my cost so doing a master's in one semester would be much better than in one/two years.

I would love to get your opinions on this so thanks a lot in advance!1 semester only? Hmm, doubt it, there are many core courses needed and they are tough. I don‚Äôt think they overlap much with CS either, they are very math oriented.I would say barely feasible. MSFE is a 36 point requirement, which is extremely tough to do in a year as masters courses tend to me more intensive than undergraduate. To even have a year, you would need to finish your CS degree a semester early which is doable with enough AP credits and no minor/fun classes etc. - ideally earlier even earlier so you can spread apart the MSFE classes.Access to libraries at CUIMC?Wondering if undergrads can use the spaces on 168th!You can.Help with Grad HousingHey there, My wife and I just got approved for Columbia couples housing and the whole housing without any real knowledge of a place seems crazy but I get it we are all in the same boat.

That said, I was hoping someone that currently lives in Columbia Housing or was previously in a Columbia Apartment would be willing to share some info on their building / apartment and maybe a couple photos of their  place?  

We are in California and can't really feel out the area or the buildings or anything so looking for anything that could help us with this decision.See if you can get a spot on Riverside.

Look at the blocks from around 114th St to 120th, pretty sure Columbia owns most of those buildings. It‚Äôs a chill location with virtually no crime.You‚Äôre post is amazing and extremely insightful. 

Coming in clutch because our window opens in 20 mins. 

Thanks again for your insights and we will definitely be looking for area & some amenities like an elevator. I might have some questions in the future but for now this has been A+++Hey! Thanks for all this information! My wife and I will be moving to 549 Riverside Drive, so it sounds like we'll be right near you. It has been hard to find much information about this area.It's rough! I've been in grad housing for a year and picked my place exclusively based on proximity to a friend's apartment who already lived here. Signed the lease without even seeing a floor plan. On the bright side, a lot of the buildings are really nice. My place is great, it's huge for manhattan and has beautiful wood floors.  Most people I know who are in grad housing are fairly happy, and I think those that aren't usually have the shitty bedroom in the 3 bed, which I don't think would be an issue in couples housing. 

What I wish I knew when looking at housing options: 

\-check the proximity to a subway station (125, 116, 110 and broadway). IMO, the closer the better. 

\-sound: I live on Riverside and I love it, it's quiet and I look out into a park. Broadway or Amsterdam will be louder, if its on a numbered street it's probably in the middle in terms of sound. I think there are a bunch of frats around 113/114, I would avoid but some people don't mind. 

\-Harlem is just uptown from campus, it starts at 125th, and the vibe definitely changes when you cross that street. I live \~124 and Riverside (although this doesn't actually exist, it's called tiemann) and I like the area, I'm happy to go into Harlem but it is a little different than the Columbia/morningside heights bubble. There are a few groceries stores around but proximity to those is also important.

Basically, you have to make your decision based on location and hope you get a nice place, and chances are pretty good that you will. If you can, get a building with an elevator. Happy to answer more questions!You‚Äôre post is amazing and extremely insightful.

Does anyone have experience getting out of University Writing as a transfer? I just took a writing course this spring at my current school that seems to be laid out very similarly to Columbia‚Äôs version and I‚Äôd really rather not take it again. I‚Äôve heard that a lot of people get out of it, but what‚Äôs the process like? Just submit some of my work and hope for the best? 

I appreciate anyone who can help with this, thanks.That‚Äôs great to hear, thank you. I‚Äôll look out for that email and see what other Core requirements I‚Äôm able to get out of, really just hoping for at least part of the language.Later in the summer, you will submit 3 papers you wrote at your previous institution, hopefully ones that show you can use evidence to support a thesis. (You'll get detailed instructions on how and where to submit your work.) Most transfers end up being exempt from UWriting.The process is more or less like what you said. You just submit your essay and wait for it to get reviewed. If I remember correctly, they also asked for the syllabus of the course for which you wrote the essays. Ideally, you wanna submit essays that involve both single and multiple sources (I only wrote essays with a single source and didnt get the exemption).That‚Äôs great to hear, thank you. I‚Äôll look out for that email and see what other Core requirements I‚Äôm able to get out of, really just hoping for at least part of the language.Premed experience at ColumbiaHey! Incoming freshman here, planning to major in biomedical engineering. I just have a few questions about being a premed at columbia <33

1. How accessible are premed-related opportunities as an undergrad? Is it easy getting clinical experience (shadowing, volunteering, scribing) through Columbia‚Äôs medschool? 

2. How is the premed outcome for SEAS students? Is it common for columbia grads to matriculate into top medschools? 

3. I received work-study as a part of my financial aid and im wondering if doing clinical research in a lab could be considered as work-study?   

4. Would it be easier to do premed in the college compared in seas? 

5. What are things that you wish you would‚Äôve done as a premed student before? Any tips on surviving columbia with a good gpa?**How accessible are premed-related opportunities as an undergrad? Is it easy getting clinical experience (shadowing, volunteering, scribing) through Columbia‚Äôs medschool?**  


It's as easy as you make it. The support is there, but you still have to try. You may not get experience directly at irving, but there are other places too. It's all in what's available. 

  
**How is the premed outcome for SEAS students? Is it common for columbia grads to matriculate into top medschools?**

&#x200B;

No data to back this up, but I would imagine it's harder for SEAS students because their GPAs are, on average, lower than the other schools. Of course this is due to their coursework, but medschools don't care. 

  
**I received work-study as a part of my financial aid and im wondering if doing clinical research in a lab could be considered as work-study?**  


No idea. You'd have to ask an advisor. 

  
**Would it be easier to do premed in the college compared in seas?**

&#x200B;

Yes. 

  
**What are things that you wish you would‚Äôve done as a premed student before? Any tips on surviving columbia with a good gpa?**

&#x200B;

Don't look at it like surviving. Fall in love with academics and you'll do great. Or at least act as though you are. Good GPAs for med school here are around 3.5 at least. It's not terribly hard to do that well here. probably around 60+ hours per week of studying. For gen chem 1 and 2, pre study those classes, as they move quick, and they're not taught well. It gets better as you take harder classes. They're typically taught better than survey courses.1. Pretty accessible, as there are many different opportunities around (Vagelos, CUIMC, Mt Sinai, MSK, NYPresbyterian, etc). Just depends on how far you‚Äôre willing to travel

2. It depends on what you do more so than ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù‚Äîsome people have gone to Harvard and some haven‚Äôt. I would say the only benefit Columbia has are networking opportunities (e.g. work w/ a prof at your target school and get a good rec letter). The premed advisory committee is very focused on seniors (in my experience), and thus not rly useful before then

3. Yes, there are work study jobs working in labs. If you DM me I can send descriptions for a few, but I believe they involved typical wet lab stuff (pipetting, cleaning, etc)

4. Yes

5. Same thing others have said, you really have to dedicate a lot of time towards your classes to do well. I would say join as many premed clubs as possible and have as many study groups as possible, more ppl in the same boat make it so much more bearable. Also I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aiming for a 4.0, but keep your mental health in mind, as it‚Äôs very possible to put in 100% effort into a class but still get less than an A. So don‚Äôt go too crazy, meet good ppl and you‚Äôll be fine, good luck!For the laboratory work-study, does that entail doing *actual* scientific research?

Is it easy getting clinical experience (shadowing, volunteering, scribing) through Columbia‚Äôs medschool?**

They're very accessible. But you have to be proactive and do the work finding the opportunities yourself.  
  
**How is the premed outcome for SEAS students? Is it common for columbia grads to matriculate into top medschools?**

I'd say it's no different. Most med schools take in difficulty of majors when looking at GPA (beyond hard cutoffs). I would say it's very common.

Hi everyone. I‚Äôll be starting my studies at Columbia this Fall 2022. I really want to see my assigned apartment share. It is called Shelburne hall on 110 morningside Dr. I Couldn‚Äôt find pictures or reviews online (including the shaft and culpa). I was able to see only a picture of the main entrance from google maps. 
I‚Äôm an international student and I‚Äôve never been to the U.S before and just wondering what kind of accessories, essentials and decorations I might want to bring from home. 

Columbia housing have viewing appointments but only in person! (too sad about that). Also my assigned roommates are keeping their info private on the housing portal, so I couldn‚Äôt reach out to them. 

If anyone has pictures/reviews/have lived/is living there would you please share either here or message me? 
I really want to see the building/ apartments from inside. 

Enjoy your Summer 
ThanksThank you so much for sharing. These are really helpful points. I would be depressed without natural light so definitely will look on the south side of the building. Also, AC would have never crossed my mind as we have them installed in every household in my hometown. I saw the park on street view on Google maps and that‚Äôs definitely a plus. I‚Äôll keep in mind the grocery store you mentioned. Thanks for the pictures really helpful.I used to live there. It‚Äôs pretty decent for university housing. The layout can be a little awkward because it‚Äôs usually a long hallway with two bedrooms and the kitchen along one wall, with the living room at one end of the hall and a third bedroom at the other end of the hall. I personally think the living room is too small for a get together unless you‚Äôre only inviting a handful of people. A big problem is that there is another building a couple of yards from the north side of it so you‚Äôre not guaranteed to have natural light. I didn‚Äôt mind before Covid but it was mentally draining on me after classes moved online. Make sure you‚Äôre living on the south side of the building which has natural light if you care about that. Another problem is that the laundry/garbage/recycling is in the basement. As far as I‚Äôm aware the only way to get to that basement is an elevator and that elevator broke down a handful of times while I was living there. Also if you get the middle room (which I had) it is by far the smallest. I think it‚Äôs half the size of the largest bedroom. Attached is a picture from my bedroom when I first moved in. 

https://i.imgur.com/kVihXmq.jpg

Edit: I will say that the location is incredible though. Right off the park + a very quick walk to the university. Appletree is close by too which is a good grocery store (albeit pricey for some things) + has a nice deli. 

Also you‚Äôll definitely want a fan or an AC unit if you plan to be there over a summer.

Edit 2: here‚Äôs a better picture of what you can expect the room size to be.

uhhhhh so wtf is going on with this class? someone on ed with admin privileges deleted this whole thread so they're aware that people are asking but would rather delete the thread than just communicate with us.

It's one thing to miss grading deadlines but to not communicate with us at all seems deeply unprofessional. I totally get it that life happens I just feel that professors should at least make an attempt to communicate with their class as opposed to disappearing. Fundies has been such a shit show lmaooocontact your dean and get others in the class to do the samealso for context, this person didn't come out of nowhere salty. someone 2 weeks ago asked for a status update on grades and no one from the teaching staff responded. strange timesNiceActually, ed was pretty responsive for this class the whole semester, it‚Äôs just now that it‚Äôs strange that it became so quietAgreed! The TAs and Prof always communicated different things. My TA said that our lowest hw would be dropped and the Prof said no at the end of the semester .This whole semester it feels like Profs and TAs just ignored everyone‚Äôs questions on Ed. No consequences, of course.It‚Äôs a legitimate complaint.

Columbia is a business, first and foremost. We pay to attend, we have timelines we as paying customers have to meet, so professors should adhere to timelines as well.LMAOHunter Holland is a bootlicking bitch!That's crazy.  I received grades more quickly while TA's were on strike mid-pandemic.Actually, ed was pretty responsive for this class the whole semester, it‚Äôs just now that it‚Äôs strange that it became so quietAgreed! The TAs and Prof always communicated different things. My TA said that our lowest hw would be dropped and the Prof said no at the end of the semester .LMAOHas anyone lived on the UES while at Columbia? What‚Äôs the commute like?How long does it take to get to Columbia in the mornings? Also what‚Äôs the safety like for women travelling after maybe 8 pm on these modes of transport?

I‚Äôd be grateful for any locality recommendations in the area as well, thank you!I don't think there is a more annoying commute than UES to UWS/Morningside. 

&#x200B;

It's pretty safe on the UES, and any subway stops in between, so safety shouldn't be a concern. But just know that your commute will be 45 minutes or more to travel between the two sides if you're only using subways. Buses can cut that down to like 30 minutes depending on whether or not you want to use the buses and whether or not there's a bus stop near your place that goes to Morningside.

&#x200B;

Safety also depends on where you end up in the UES, so definitely check out the [NYC Crime Map](https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/) to figure out which precinct you'd be in.

&#x200B;

For me personally, I'd recommend trying to find a place on the UWS, or if you love the UES then think about getting a moped or something that can cut down your commute time.If the weather is nice, a bike will be faster than the subway and more pleasant. The UES is a big place, so this depends on where.Timing will depend on where on the UES. There's a good deal of area (East/West and North/South) and where you are located and proximity to the subway or bus will make a big difference. You can hop a crosstown bus to the West Side and take the 1 train up to Columbia. You can also get to the M4 bus which goes up Madison, crosses West at 110th and then right up to Columbia. None of these are particularly dangerous routes but everyone has their own assessment of risk. 

It's totally doable if you're committed to the UES or have some affinity for it or some great opportunity. But my $0.02 is that if you're going to to commute 30-45 minutes, there are more interesting neighborhoods.Wouldn't recommend it. It's much easier to travel north/south than east/west in NYC, especially through central park. Unless you have a partner living over there or some amazing deal on rent, I'd highly recommend something on the west sidenot the same as living but had a good friend live on 3rd Ave and 116th that I visited often. 

commute was the m116 bus which only has a stop at 106th in broadway or get off the bus earlier and cross morningside park which I dont recommend for safety reasons and for the amount of stairs

the subway alternative was taking the 1 to 96 and switching to the 2/3 and leaving the stop at 116th and walking 10 minutes or so to 3rd Ave.

I would always uber when it was late at night because of how far the bus stop was. what's nice is that uber was never more than 15$ and could be as cheap as 8$

it really depends where on the east side you're going, check the bus routes if you really want to do east side. people saying it's 40 mins are right if you're doing public transport

tldr; it's annoying commutePlenty of decent neighborhoods in Harlem too. South of 125th around 8th Ave and west from there. Close walk to campus up through the park...Transferring from Cornell to SEASis this feasible if so how

I get yk shocked by the like 6% transfer rate 
but I got in RD and decided to go to Cornell because I chickened out over the core.

Even though yk SEAS doesn‚Äôt need to do the core.

How can I get in via transfer. 

And what GPA should I aim for since Cornell Engineering is notorious for its grade deflationI transferred from UMD to CC. 

It is possible. Just get good grades, be real with ur profs on why u want to transfer and send it. 

Good luckTransferred from Cornell. Feel free to dmCan I finish computer science major requirements in 2 years?Hi all,

I was recently admitted to Columbia as a junior transfer! I'm bringing 60 points with me from my previous institution, where I studied finance. Given that Columbia does not have an undergraduate business program, I won't be able to continue my study of finance. I am considering economics (44 points), computer science (40-47 points), and history (30 points) as alternatives. 

Regardless of the major I choose, I need to be able to graduate in two years and will be unable to take courses nexts summer. I was fortunate enough to effectively secure a dream full-time position which would begin in June of 2024. Because of the fact that I **really** want this job I would be hard-pressed to push graduation beyond this date, and therefore need to graduate within two years.

For those who have experience within these areas of study, is it at all possible to graduate within two years? For additional color, to complete the core, I'll need to take three semesters of language, one global core class, Literature, Art, Music, and UW (27 credits total).

Also, any additional suggestions are welcome.if you've already got your "dream" job, i would look towards a major that will be easier to fulfill. even if technically possible (not sure it is, you'd have to plot out the four semesters), 2-3 CS classes *minimum*/semester is no joke.

once you start working your dream job, your undergrad major won't matter as much. if you care about enjoying some of the social aspects of your last two years of college, it may be worth it to look into getting a concentration. afaik, a concentration awards the exact same degree while taking some of the pressure off of completing every part of a major.How many credits did you transfer in with?If you're GS, you have to pick a major, you can't pick a concentration unfortunately.Probably not.  I was a junior transfer and it turned my 4 year degree into a 5 year.

Check out a concentration instead.  You don't actually have to have a major here, just an area of study.Damn, this is different from what I‚Äôve heard. Is this per a specific college or general info? Online for GS I see it quoted at 40-47, dependent upon track selection and optional courses.GS may have different requirements but this is what CC and SEAS students have to abide byI just checked, my 60 credit total includes gen tech electives which GS may not needThe CS requirements for CC and GS are the same: [https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/c/d.php?d=271](https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/c/d.php?d=271)

They were also updated recently on the link. The CS core is 24 ish credits + 15 ish credits for your track, and you need to also fulfil the Calc requirement.As it currently stands the CS core is as follows:

1. Intro to CS 3 credits
2. Intro to Computing 3 (I don't know if this is seas only) 3 credits
3. Data Structures 3 credits 
4. Discrete Math 4 credits 
5. Advanced Programming 4 credits
6. Computational Linear Algebra  4 credits
7. Fundamentals of Computer Systems 3 credits
8. CS Theory 3 credits 
For a total of 24-27 credits. 

Then you ~21 credits of track courses from the approved tracks. So about 7 classes there. Then you need 15 credits of gen technical requirements so about 5 classes there

So we are looking at 60 credit hours worth for the major plus what other requirements you have to meet. 

Unless those 60 transfer credits can help cover some of these requirements then I do not believe it is feasible to computer the major in 2 yearsDo you know what you‚Äôd like to do post-graduation?Product/ux designYou can look into the information science major, I also had to finish my major in 2 years and I am very happy with infosci!You may want to consider only doing a concentration, rather than a major. It‚Äôll be less classes so a more manageable scheduleI'm not quite sure what the issue is here. You can absolutely finish ~ 40 Credit hours in 4 semesters if that's what you're doing.

Most 3-2 students spend only 2 years at Columbia and are expected to complete their Engineering degree in that time. This typically requires ~ 60 credits, 15 credits a semester. Some students even take on more responsibility, pushing for a masters, or minor.

That being said, Columbia is very difficult - especially to blaze through. I understand you're ambitious, believe me lol, but don't commit to something that may make your life hell for 2 years in a hasty decision. CS is very interesting, but chill out cause you already have a job my guy. I say target an easy schedule at Columbia and fill up the remaining time with a few of the most important CS classes like Data Structures, AP, Algorithms, maybe OS etc.I think you can do it if you take summer classes. Coming in with 60 credits it will take me 2.5 years, with 1 summer class and no overloaded semesters. If you're the type that can handle 18 credit semesters that's an option too but it will be painful.If you're GS, you have to pick a major, you can't pick a concentration unfortunately.How many credits did you transfer in with?GS may have different requirements but this is what CC and SEAS students have to abide byI just checked, my 60 credit total includes gen tech electives which GS may not needThe CS requirements for CC and GS are the same: [https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/c/d.php?d=271](https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/c/d.php?d=271)

The basic gist is that preparation is better than anything you can do. It may sound awful, and often times it is, but it is so much more time efficient to be prepared for a class prior to lecture than it is to learn the material for the first time in lecture. This isn't always possible but it's possible like 90% of the time, and if you're disciplined about being prepared for every lecture you'll probably find you have so much more free time than you'd expect.Are Professors understanding and friendly?All of mine have been so far, they‚Äôve even gone out of their way on several occasions to make me feel comfortable when I asked a question I thought was silly or too basic. One other thing you can do is go to the TA‚Äôs office hours, which are also super helpful and there‚Äôs maybe a bit less pressure because it‚Äôs a slightly more casual environment.Go to office hours if you have trouble understanding something or are nervous about a paper or test. There‚Äôs no such thing as a stupid question and the office hours exist specifically to give students extra help.By asking stupid questionsAll good answers above! Wanted to also mention that starting early is very important so that you don‚Äôt fall behind all of your classes at the same time. Mark all your assignment deadlines and also the dates that you will start working on them. I set reminders to start studying for exams two weeks before the date, and for essays I would try to start brainstorming a month in advance. Point is you have anticipate where you might have problems and troubleshoot things early by getting help before it‚Äôs too late.Super important: ***don't be afraid to ask for help!***Grades are fake and don't matter. Just do your best.Honestly hard work and smart work don't always bring good grades, my question is more focused on the exclusive strategies as a Columbia student. Managing internships and coursework is one hell of a Herculean task, any say on the approach ?Get good gradesWhat specific culture do you have in mind Mr. Hovercraft ?Cheating cultureThat includes the hedge fund kids who have people do all their essays for them, or maybe the athletes who struggle to draw a supply curve in my econ class. Americans are famous for cultural appropriation, I don't think they will leave out the cheating culture either :((You should take a break from social media for a while. 

Trust me you‚Äôll feel better.I am already feeling good. This is because I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now...It takes a lot of work and other people have answered your core question.

However, you should know that many MANY students cheat. Cheat on homework, cheat on exams (eg TAs leaking exams), etc. Especially international students from a culture that almost encourages cheating.If you show up prepared to every class and engage, the teacher will know you and will probably know your name.

What if I didn‚Äôt have a fin aid package until now but due to shift in family income and the new policy I qualify for it? Would I have to apply separately for fin aid?I got my financial aid package for this coming year recently and based on household income/assets, I would qualify. Should I be reaching about this policy being applied or will it be done retroactively when I am billed?Yeah, you need to reach out to Fin Aid quickly, the document filing was due at the beginning of May. If you're a US citizen/resident, you should still be fine, but if you're international you might be in a tough spot if you weren't admitted with aid. Also note that it's still going to take into consideration overall financial assets, so if you didn't qualify before and your asset situation hasn't changed much, it might not be the full tuition discountAre you a current CC/SEAS student? The new financial aid update is being applied to all packages going forward, it's not a separate thing that you specifically apply for. If you're a prospective student, just apply for fin aid when you apply for admissionWhere did you see this info?Yeah, you need to reach out to Fin Aid quickly, the document filing was due at the beginning of May.

Especially the corner of the 133rd W street and Adam Clayton Powell Blvd ?merci de ta r√©ponse. Je vois ce que tu veux dire, les gens ont tellement des avis diff√©rents mais j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression que c‚Äôest pas l√©tal d‚Äôhabiter la bas mais √ßa reste plus dangereux qu‚ÄôailleursWest African Francophone here. Studied in France and knows the suburbs of Paris. Harlem is nicer than most of those places in the Banlieue. I live in Morningside Heights but would definitely live in Harlem if I found a good housing offer there. I actually spend a lot of my free time in Harlem. And again, as said by @Brandywine5, violent crimes against Columbia students as of late happened right next to campus.It does not FEEL safe, but it is generally as safe as anywhere else in NY.


You‚Äôd somewhat stand out there.
I‚Äôm a girl and lived in harlem for a few months, I definitely did not like the area and living there, but it was generally safe. I walked at night home so many times and it was okay.Data is your friend here.   
https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/I grew up in the hood in LA so I feel you. What feels ‚Äúsafe‚Äù may not have the same definition for othersThanks for the feedback ü´∂To add to this - avoid parks after dark and as a general rule, be mindful of your surroundings. Both Columbia students who were stabbed/murdered where either in a park or close to an entrance at the time of their assault.Cannot upvote this enough. I'm originally from upstate NY (hour and a half north of the city) and what I consider "safe" differs from what someone who I grew up on the UWS considers to be safe. Manhattan is generally safe compared to other parts of the city, and it is generally safer than other cities in the state.I grew up in the hood. I feel fine walking through Harlem, as long as you mind your business you‚Äôre fine. Don‚Äôt be stupid, don‚Äôt be out super late in the city at all. The Columbia students that got murdered and stabbed were in Morningside heights. 

The other commenters in here saying otherwise just feel like pearl-clutching to me if I‚Äôm honest.Thanks for the feedback and the little tips, I‚Äôll try my best to get near these areas üëåüèºIt won‚Äôt feel as safe as living further south, but it‚Äôs obv doable otherwise all these kids wouldn‚Äôt defend it so much.

If you have non-Harlem options though, maybe look into those. It‚Äôs definitely more ‚Äúhood‚Äù than people are willing to admit.

If you can, you should look into housing on Riverside or south of 116th. Much better imo and close to campus.I  agree and Harlem is much safer than what it was in the 70s, 80s. Racism and racial stereotypes definitely factor into how the public perceives "safety". Perhaps though some of the women in your building might have different perceptions of safety because of their gender, lived-experience? It can be scary to be alone in NYC, but especially as a young, single woman. I've experienced harassment solely because I'm a small woman; shitty people (regardless of race) perceive me as someone they can potentially exploit or take advantage of. And as a result, I'm hyper-vigilant with my surroundings because I've had to deal with aggressive panhandlers, aggressive cat-callers, being groped at a particular location in the past. Absolute worst circumstance, I had a guy follow me for a few blocks on 125th Street while trying to make my way to Metro North after dark. 

Overall though, Harlem is a nice neighborhood. The locals are friendly, there's a lot of good food and the growing West African enclaves are always fun to check out. And too, all neighborhoods have problems, even if they are not immediately apparent.Fair enough, I cannot speak to a woman's lived experience about which NYC neighborhoods are safer than others. To clarify, the women I lived with in Harlem thought it was fine, but there were others when I was living near Columbia who would never venture east of Morningside Heights. Race and size played a part in that as well, so makes sense that different women had different threat perceptions.

Sorry you have to deal with all that though. My ex said that she experienced a lot more catcalling and harassment in NYC when walking by herself since the pandemic started. Way too much asshole behavior these days.Agreed! And thank you for being so understanding! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI am an Asian-American dude who lived on 131st and Lenox for a month or two back in the day when I had to stay in an Airbnb before getting Columbia housing, my neighbors in the two rooms next to me were a couple from Burkina Faso and some white girl. I thought it was pretty safe as a mid 20's dude, to be frank I always thought the Asian and White people I talked to who were scared of it were just uncomfortable with having so many black people around. But if I could I would live closer to 125th street which is super crowded and busy so it's a little safer as opposed to a little further up where it gets real quiet if you walk home late at night. But I'm sure further south is more expensive.

My understanding talking to the dude from Burkina Faso is that there is a pretty vibrant West African community there by the way. So that could help with feeling safe if you are able to make friends around there.Shrine is an excellent bar with live music and shows right there.Maybe some people are talking about race, but if you view the maps.nyc.gov/crime/ that Deimateos posted, you'll see that crime is significantly higher in harlem. Especially of the sexual assault/rape kind. If you go to CU, you should understand raw data enough to not politicize factual information. There‚Äôs nothing inherently racist about fearing for your safety, especially as NYC has had some relatively high murder rates during and since COVID. 

I used to live in some of the most heroin/crime filled parts of the coast, and I agree that what you said is good advice. That being said, it doesn‚Äôt negate factual information.I‚Äôve heard that before. Unfortunately the room is far in the north of the Adam Powell Blvd. I feel like it is not safe. I know racism and fear are a big issue in every country (I‚Äôm an Arab Muslim living in France ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è), I just want to be safe from drugs and gunfire.Crime is significantly higher in Harlem compared to what? If you look at a crime map, you‚Äôll see Central Harlem is safer or equivalent to almost the entirety of downtown and midtown Manhattan/the majority of the Bronx/parts of Brooklyn. While it is less ‚Äúsafe‚Äù than Morningside heights, Hamilton heights, and UWS/UES ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt any more significantly unsafe than most of Manhattan. 

And when you compare Columbia‚Äôs Morningside Heights (26th precinct) to (28th precinct) Central Harlem (1.2 crimes per 1000, and 1.5 crimes per 1000, respectively) it is a negligible difference ‚Äî the real big difference is how demographic makeup (aka race) alters people‚Äôs perception of how safe an area is. 

Seems like you‚Äôre the one who needs to understand and learn how to accurately assess what a map is trying to convey (and also realize a NYPD crime map will reflect the racism, profiling, and bias of their policing).I might get downvoted for this, but I think since you are brown, you will blend in and not have any problems. I‚Äôve spent time around there and have not had any trouble. 

Behave the same way you would in Paris. Don‚Äôt talk to strangers when walking at night. Don‚Äôt walk with your phone out. Etc‚Ä¶And also, the location you mentioned is nice! Close to Harlem Grows, Harlem hops, good park nearby, good subway access, lots of schools, and good food.Guns and drugs can be anywhere in NYC, doesn‚Äôt matter what neighborhood. That area of Harlem is safe ‚Äî there is a decline in total crime and increased patrol. The worst gun and drug problems in Harlem cluster around NYCHA/East Harlem, sadly. Downtown/midtown/Bronx/parts of Brooklyn are comparatively more crime-ridden and dangerous than CH, statistically.You need to watch fewer racist movies and read more.Notice I specifically mentioned sexual assault and murder. The OP was asking about safety, so I specified to crimes that had to do with that. Grand larceny almost never involves violence. Same with property crimes etc. apples and oranges my friend! 

I‚Äôm not sure what could be biased by observing sexual assault and murder, but if you‚Äôre implying that cops are more likely to report sexual assault in central Harlem, that would go against the idea that sexual assault is underreported even though that‚Äôs well understood. Rape is a self reported crime, and murder is‚Ä¶ murder. So it‚Äôs hard to mess with that data. It is what it is. 

When you look at the data with the correct metrics in mind, (the ones I specified that you ignored) you‚Äôll realize why people are cautious about living in Harlem. Personally, I would live in Harlem. It‚Äôs a lot more like where I came from. My roommates wouldn‚Äôt do it though.I get what you mean by that don‚Äôt worry, same logic apply about ¬´¬†blending¬†¬ª in some surburbs in Paris. Thanks for the feedbackThank you for the alternative feedback that kind of reassuring me.You said ‚Äúcrime‚Äù is significantly higher in Harlem overall ‚Äî even though you gave nothing to compare it to lol. Higher than what? (I ask, again). 

Every major category of crime besides murder has ticked up sharply in NYC ‚Äî rape is up 27% city-wide year-over-year. Separating by category and cherry-picking data isn‚Äôt helpful ‚Äî it‚Äôs the overall crime rate in one neighborhood vs another that is the only actual useful metric for comparison.Fear and racism makes some Columbia students apprehensive about Harlem. Statistically Central Harlem is safe ‚Äî and Harlem is a great place to live, just mind your business and you‚Äôre good. Safety varies block by block, with streets closest to Central Park being generally safest (110-116).thank you for your answer, that‚Äôs what I thought in the first place.not safe at allthank you for your answerDon'tThat‚Äôs the problem, I find a trustworthy agency (they already rent a room to a girl which gave me a good feedback) and it‚Äôll need me to engage to keep it for me üôÉNot great.

Thanks for the feedbackThank you for the alternative feedback that kind of reassuring me.I‚Äôve heard that before.

I'm originally from upstate NY (hour and a half north of the city) and what I consider "safe" differs from what someone who I grew up on the UWS considers to be safe. Manhattan is generally safe compared to other parts of the city, and it is generally safer than other cities in the state.Agreed! And thank you for being so understanding! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èFair enough, I cannot speak to a woman's lived experience about which NYC neighborhoods are safer than others. To clarify, the women I lived with in Harlem thought it was fine, but there were others when I was living near Columbia who would never venture east of Morningside Heights. Race and size played a part in that as well, so makes sense that different women had different threat perceptions.

Sorry you have to deal with all that though. My ex said that she experienced a lot more catcalling and harassment in NYC when walking by herself since the pandemic started. Way too much asshole behavior these days.Notice I specifically mentioned sexual assault and murder. The OP was asking about safety, so I specified to crimes that had to do with that. Grand larceny almost never involves violence. Same with property crimes etc. apples and oranges my friend! 

I‚Äôm not sure what could be biased by observing sexual assault and murder, but if you‚Äôre implying that cops are more likely to report sexual assault in central Harlem, that would go against the idea that sexual assault is underreported even though that‚Äôs well understood. Rape is a self reported crime, and murder is‚Ä¶ murder. So it‚Äôs hard to mess with that data. It is what it is. 

When you look at the data with the correct metrics in mind, (the ones I specified that you ignored) you‚Äôll realize why people are cautious about living in Harlem. Personally, I would live in Harlem. It‚Äôs a lot more like where I came from. My roommates wouldn‚Äôt do it though.You said ‚Äúcrime‚Äù is significantly higher in Harlem overall ‚Äî even though you gave nothing to compare it to lol. Higher than what? (I ask, again). 

Every major category of crime besides murder has ticked up sharply in NYC ‚Äî rape is up 27% city-wide year-over-year. Separating by category and cherry-picking data isn‚Äôt helpful ‚Äî it‚Äôs the overall crime rate in one neighborhood vs another that is the only actual useful metric for comparison.Crime is significantly higher in Harlem compared to what? If you look at a crime map, you‚Äôll see Central Harlem is safer or equivalent to almost the entirety of downtown and midtown Manhattan/the majority of the Bronx/parts of Brooklyn. While it is less ‚Äúsafe‚Äù than Morningside heights, Hamilton heights, and UWS/UES ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt any more significantly unsafe than most of Manhattan. 

And when you compare Columbia‚Äôs Morningside Heights (26th precinct) to (28th precinct) Central Harlem (1.2 crimes per 1000, and 1.5 crimes per 1000, respectively) it is a negligible difference ‚Äî the real big difference is how demographic makeup (aka race) alters people‚Äôs perception of how safe an area is. 

Seems like you‚Äôre the one who needs to understand and learn how to accurately assess what a map is trying to convey (and also realize a NYPD crime map will reflect the racism, profiling, and bias of their policing).I get what you mean by that don‚Äôt worry, same logic apply about ¬´¬†blending¬†¬ª in some surburbs in Paris.

Does this mean we get student discounts forever???Email isn‚Äôt always enough to get a student discount but you can try I supposeI think it depends. Things like Microsoft subscriptions terminate quickly.Because it‚Äôs a gmail it‚Äôs a permanent email even after graduation but tragically most things that offer student discounts only do so for a limited time :(Sometimes yes, sometimes no. More sophisticated companies & more expensive subs are wise to permanent emails & make you go through a verification process.Can i survive computer scienceSo im an incoming freshman and i was wondering since I didn‚Äôt have maths in 11th & 12th grade im an international student so will I be able to cope up with uni CS major? Like I had stem subjects like physics chem and CS in hs so definitely not far off like a humanities bg but is it manageable? Like im definitely determined to work hard if I don‚Äôt understand some math electives but want your inputs on thisüôèüèªYou should definitely take Calc 2 as well imo.

Not sure why people think integration is an ‚Äúoptional‚Äù subject in Calc lol.Only 1 and 3 are grad requirements ü´§Yeah, I know. And that‚Äôs a mistake imo.

It‚Äôs part of the problem with CompSci as a major and software engineering as a job field. People want to increase numbers so they water down requirements (ie quantity over quality).It‚Äôs doable. Columbia offers pre-calc if you‚Äôre really worried, but chances are you could just do a little bit of self-study and be fine for calc 1 and then 3. 

Really important is to choose the right professor though; some professors are a LOT better at teaching math than others.Only 1 and 3 are grad requirements ü´§Yeah, I know. And that‚Äôs a mistake imo.

CVN student here doing my masters. In my first year, I've felt that one major experience that I've lacked is the experience of being able to connect and network with other students, given the distance learning, as that experience has been minimal within my courses as well.

Recently in one of my courses we had get-to-know-each-other sessions where three students are put in one Zoom room for a period of time each week and I think it would be cool to bring into the bigger Columbia community for us CVN students to connect with each other. I think it was also great since it personalizes the experiences as well (with having a few people to meet each week in a random grouping compared to the whole network in a Zoom room chatting at once).

If you're currently studying on campus, would really love to get to know you as well, so feel free to join too! Would be great to get some people to know and hang out with when coming over to New York for either taking courses or for graduation (both are in my plans at the moment at least)!

If you're interested in this, I've made a discord at [https://discord.gg/eKbNWERy](https://discord.gg/eKbNWERy), but feel free to also DM me/comment below as well; happy to connect! Do suggest other ways of connecting or doing things if you have any as well!anyone from the masters in financial engineering program?Available room in very large very reasonable apartment in Harlem.Hey everybody! I‚Äôm looking for someone to sublet my room in an apartment on W 127th in Harlem. 

It would be available from mid-June to September with the option of renewal. 

Rent and utilities run about $1450 and the apartment itself is seriously spacious and modern. 

If you or anyone you know is looking for a room this summer and into the fall school semester please feel free to message me. I‚Äôd love to get this great spot into a Columbia students hands! 

Cheers!Whittier HallI have the chance to live in Whittier Hall this upcoming school year. Should I take it? Has anyone ever lived in Whittier or known anyone who has?

May I ask you some questions about Columbia CS and GS?

1. Is there any undergraduate student who works with professor Elias Bareinboim? I am really interested in causality in Machine Learning and I really want to work with professor Bareinboim. Or is there any undergraduate student who works with professor Carl Vondrick? His researches are very intriguing as well. Is it very hard to work with these professors as undergraduate?
2. How is the computer science class size at Columbia? I have heard that the class size can be quite large even though Columbia is a private school. Do you have a hard time getting to know with professors due to the size of classes and long waiting for office hours?
3. Can you take graduate classes in CS, Math and Statistics as undergrad? Also, there's no declaration requirements or restrictions like Berkeley when declaring cs/math/statistics, right?
4. Finally, is there a lot of disadvantage for being a GS student? I was wondering why so many people describe themselves as CC/SEAS/Bernard/GS student instead of Columbia Uni student. It seems there are clear divide within the school... Is the atmosphere hostile to one another?

I am an international student and I am planning to apply for ML phd programs in America. Money is not an issue for me. Thank you!Thank you for your reply! Are there classes that require interviews to get in??2: Never had an issue with the size of CS classes, I've gotten into every CS course I've wanted to take including those that required an application/interview to get in (mainly the 4995 classes). Also have gotten to know CS profs and was a TA for one for a while.

3: I only know for CS, but yes, you can take graduate level CS courses as an undergrad.

4: Like the other commenter said the only disadvantage is less aid compared to the other undergraduate schools. There is no hostility.. the university is just organized in a decentralized way. Another example is that each department pays TA's a different amount, there's like four different offices for student housing, three different public safety offices, etc. It's just the way the university is organized. The stigma you may have read online regarding GS, IMO, is more related to your age than the school you go to.Thank you for your reply! Would I have to get A/A+ in multiple courses and related projects to join Professor Vondrick's lab? I've heard in Berkeley, one has to get A+ in certain courses and have related projects to join a ML lab and I am wondering this is the case in Columbia as wellI was more so referring to doing well in COMS 4731 or COMS 4732, the two Computer Vision courses that Carl teaches. If you do reasonably well (A- or above) and are active in his office hours that would put you in the best position to work with him (or TA for his courses if interested)

In your other courses they really only care about your grades in related courses. Every ML professor here that I‚Äôve been interviewed by has asked about ML, AI, etc. while none have asked for my University Writing grade. I‚Äôm sure like an F in a humanities class would alarm them but anything in the passing range is fine. Alternatively, if you haven‚Äôt taken a class but have projects you‚Äôre equally fine. My first yr I asked to do research w/ a prof and obviously I hadn‚Äôt taken any classes yet, so they asked for my github repo to see related ML projects

I‚Äôm only guessing, but it‚Äôs probably that way at UCB because it‚Äôs a huge school, so a lot of students are vying for those positions. CS at Columbia is small enough to where you can do research with any professor, it‚Äôs just a matter of time and experience (some are open to first yrs while others prefer third/fourth yrs)Thank you for your detailed reply! I am sorry to bother you but may I ask you some more questions? Do ML professors at Columbia allocate enough time to   
 undergraduate researchers for advising? I have heard in Berkeley (I've heard a lot about Berkeley cause my friends went there. I am from California), undergraduate research assistants rarely get to work with professors and instead they mostly work under graduate students and thus, when they need to ask for LORs, most of them just get generic LORs unless he or she is really exceptional. Is this the case in Columbia as well?

Also do professors like David Blei work with undergrads?

Thank you again for your help!Yea np. That‚Äôs less of a Columbia/Berkeley thing and more just any lab in general. If it‚Äôs a larger, well known lab then you‚Äôll probably work with a PhD instead of the PI. If it‚Äôs smaller/more niche/newer then you‚Äôll probably work directly with the PI. 

Carl has a bunch of PhD students and post-grads so probably working with them. Not sure how big prof Blei‚Äôs lab is but he‚Äôs super busy (always giving talks) so I would assume he‚Äôs also pretty unavailable lol.Thank you so much for your help! I am interested in vision as well and I was surprised by the placement of professor Vondrick's undergrad researchers(according to his website one went to MIT and the other went to Berkeley) It seems he advised his students well. Are there a lot of students from his lab who went to good phd programs?I know Carl works with undergrads, he has ~2-4 in his lab right now. Pretty sure it‚Äôs as easy as having a background in computer vision (e.g. taking his class) then emailing him.

Not sure about Bareinboim>Only stigma is that GS students annoyingly set high curves in STEM classes.

Thank you for your reply! Do you mean that GS students are pushing the average grade higher? Are all the classes curved so that if you're below the average you will get a bad grade even though the average is like 93?They have the highest avr GPA. Mostly because of the extra competitive nontraditional premedical program. No one's butthurt about it, it's just slightly daunting if you're in a class with a lot of GS students. Lol.Never felt any stigma. Only stigma is that GS students annoyingly set high curves in STEM classes. That's about it.2. CS classes can be pretty large since there are a lot of CS majors. I‚Äôm sure if you visit the office hour often, you should be able to get closer with the professors.

3. Pretty sure you can take grad classes but you probably need to take the prereq obviously. For major declaration, i think u just declare what you wanna major (at least thats what i did)

4. The only disadvantage i can think of is GS students get less aid (which may not even apply to you since you are international anyways). Other than that, everyone takes the same classes, and I havent noticed any hostility among students from different schools, so I wouldnt worry too much about that.Thank you so much for your detailed reply! It's amazing that undergrads can work with professors so highly regarded in their respective fields. I am sorry to bother you but may I ask you some more questions? Is getting into lab(professor Bareinboim's and Vondrick's labs) as simple as getting good grades (A/A+) at the classes that the professors teach or would I have to prepare some kinds of projects to demonstrate my capabilities? I've heard in some universities(Berkeley), some professors require multiple A+ in relevant courses and projects in order to join their labs... I am wondering this is the case in Columbia as well.1. I have a friend who worked with professor Bareinboim as a biomedical engineering major. Both professors have taken undergrad students, but in my (arbitrary) view professor Bareinboim might be slightly more willing to take new students only because professor Vondrick already has a lot of students who want to work with him.  
(I've seen in a previous comment about Professor Blei; I don't think he usually takes undergrads because most undergrads don't have the necessary background knowledge in ML theory and math to be able to work with him.   
A good criterion to look at is if the professor teaches a class. It should be relatively possible to work with any professor that teaches classes that undergrads can attend.)
2. The class sizes are pretty big compared to other majors. The classes that are core requirements (and thus are taken the most) range from 350\~400 students with 2 sections, meaning there are sometimes at most 700\~800 students taking the class in one semester.   
The waitlists are pretty big (especially for classes related to machine learning) and some classes require you to take a test and be in the top x%, some classes require you to fill out a survey, etc.   
I don't think getting to know a professor is hard (even for the biggest classes) simply because not many students reach out personally to the professors to begin with. Showing up during office hours and sending some emails expressing your genuine interest should be sufficient.
3. Absolutely, a lot of my friends (including myself) have taken graduate-level classes since our freshman/sophomore years. Columbia's pretty lenient on that part, thankfully.  
Although there are prerequisites the professors don't check if you've taken the classes (most classes don't, but some restricted classes might) so it's your own responsibility that you know the prereqs (some classes also have an aptitude test as mentioned earlier to make sure you're ready for the class).   
There are no strict restrictions, but there are classes that are restricted to certain majors or grades. In these cases, you can shoot an email to the professor and ask if you can take the class.
4. No, not at all! Well, I'm in SEAS so I might not be in the right position to talk about this, but in terms of getting research positions and class registration, you won't be disadvantaged in any way (at least not that I know of) because you're in GS (well, it wouldn't make any sense to be at a disadvantage just because you're not in CC or SEAS).Great comments from the other contributors. I‚Äôll just say congrats on being accepted, both are outstanding institutions.Thank you for your reply!

This Fall, I'm planning to take Intro to Java with Blaer while taking Data Structures--is this a feasible or wise choice? I'm planning to practice some Java coding during the summer just to get a bit ahead. But anyone have any advice for me to self-study Java and/or data structures? What were the most challenging parts of Data Structures for you? What was the course load and assignments like? Any online resources that were helpful for you in those classes?Thank you for your response! If you'd be able to pm me the full list of topics for both courses, or even screenshots of the syllabi, that would be greatly appreciated! I'm just really anxious about the fall semester because the past two semesters I have only been taking at most 17 credits a semester and didn't get super good grades in some courses :(, so I want to make sure I get ahead credit-wise and also prepare myself to get better grades. I took intro to Python with Bauer but dropped it half way in the fall semester, so I didn't get to complete it which kinda puts me a little behind on the CS path. I've heard from some people that Data Structures is very difficult, so I guess that makes me even more anxious. I'm still deciding if I should just do Java and DS at the same time in the fall, or just do Java and an extra fun class in the fall and complete DS in the spring since you said that Blaer is redesigning the DS outline. Also since there's going to be a new professor for DS in the fall, idk if they will be very good or lenient compared to Blaer and I want to make sure the class structure is good and not too harsh.PmedTypically Professor Blaer is the one who teaches Data Structures (3134) but not this fall as there is a new hire from the department who is instructing it this upcoming semester. 

That being said all the information I am giving you is based off knowledge of Blaer's 1004 and 3134 (as I just finished that sequence this past year) 

For someone who has rather limited experience in Java while I do not recommend taking them concurrently in the event you have a light schedule and want to devote the time there is no reason you shouldn't be able to succeed. 

1004 covers introductory Java concepts 
-how to write a Java program 
-iterations and conditionals 
-basic algorithms 
-interfaces 
-recursion 

That is quite a simplified version of it, I have the full list if you would like of topics for both courses. 

Interfaces and Recursion are the main ones there as they are used extensively in Data Structures. 

Especially since the department labels 3134 as a 2nd year course in the bulletin you aren't "getting ahead" by doing them concurrently. 

Also I believe they are also redesigning the courses a tad bit to get rid of the theory intensive stuff in 1004 and putting some introductory data structures knowledge in there and then changing data structures to reflect that although 1004 changes I believe will be effective in the fall DS will start it's new curriculum in the Spring (since it's a sequence after all) 

That way Blaer can fully test out the new curriculum, since he will be the first to teach both the new 1004 and the new 3134 according to this plan which is subject to changes of course, I only know this as a TA of the other 1004 professor. 

Professor Blaer also likes to comment on CS related things in the reddit so I'm sure he's bound to show up here sooner or later, if he does indeed show up, hello professor :DYes, this is ambitious. Programming, like math, is one of those things you just can't fake competency in. Either your code compiles, or it doesn't.

There's a couple things to note about programming in school:

1. Programming necessitates a different way of thinking; a structured thought process with a lot of patience. Like art, you may have a knack for this, it may come easy for you, it may not.

2. A college class is still *just* a college class. What I mean by that is: you are fed content by the instructor, you complete an assignment based on that content, you take some test, you get a grade based on how you do. What I noticed in school is that, regardless of the subject, the A students are probably still gonna be A students, the B students are still prob gonna be B students etc. 

Typically, the disciplined kids who pay very close attention to project details, and who constantly go to office hours will still do well, even if they don't totally understand programming. So if you're one of these kids, you can do well in class by just doing school as you've been doing. Learn, read, ask questions, pay close attention to project details.You don‚Äôt need to lolThe only thing I can add is:

a.) Discrete Math (on par with the Rosen textbook) will really help you on DS algo theory and fundamental mathematical basis on why recursion actually works (not just some educated @sshole telling you to take a blind ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù when in reality trial and error in this respect would cause Karel the Robot to go kaput into an infinite loop!).

b.) I highly recommend Fahim from educative.io‚Äôs 1004-style crash course https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-object-oriented-programming-in-java and his 3134 coding interview review (https://www.educative.io/courses/data-structures-coding-interviews-java AND https://www.educative.io/courses/algorithms-coding-interviews-java).  

For more detailed concept-by-concept review, try Geeks4Geeks site at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/?ref=shm AND https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm.  It‚Äôs not everything you‚Äôll need to get above the mean in 1004 & 3134, but it‚Äôs a damn good start.  

Beats the f*ck outta memorizing the textbook, eh?  Something Jian Yang from HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù would definitely do‚Ä¶ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJhA8jjcSM.It's certainly doable. I know someone who previously didn't know any Java when he took Data Structures, and ended up getting an A+. I wouldn't worry, Data Structures is a fairly easy class in my experience.PmedThank you for your response!

I heard he doesn‚Äôt use a textbook and I would like to get started during the summer to not fall behind. Thanks!He makes his own textbook 

However, I‚Äôm ngl, it‚Äôs legit hard to understand his textbook unless you go to lecture. There‚Äôs so much fluff and useless stuffDM me your uni or email, and I'll send both his "lecture notes" (which replace the textbook) and the syllabus (and maybe some other nuggets I can find too)!Calc-based Intro to Stats and Intermediate MicroeconomicsI have heard a lot of horror stories about these classes. Any tips/advice/heads up for these classes?
P.S I do not know the my professors names yet.The 4000 level intro to stats, the professor spent most of the sesh discouraging people from taking it. Said you‚Äôd be lucky to finish the midterm in half a day, a lot of people have to pull all-nighters. 

So I took 1201 instead and it wasn‚Äôt bad.in stat, we used the devore textbook and i found it to be a lot more useful than lecture. It‚Äôll be made a lot easier the more calculus knowledge you have. We did double integrals which is a topic in calc iv.Micro, take Nyman if u can 

1201, they're all going to suckTake STAT 1201 with Robbins.

 Intermediate Micro is not difficult as long as you stay on top of everything‚Äì‚Äìto be honest, I think it is the easiest class in the Econ department. Some professors are more mathematically rigorous than others, but I think overall it should not be hard.Transfer RegistrationIf you come across this post I hope that you are having a good Monday afternoon!

I'm a recent transfer admit to Columbia and wanted to ask if there were any transfers on this sub who could answer a few questions regarding registration.

Generally, when would new transfer students register and would it be before or during freshman registration. Also, I've seen a lot of posts on this sub that mentioned the difficulty of getting into certain classes, but usually how difficult is it to get the classes you need (particularly Pre-Health)?

Thanks so much for anyone's help, it truly means a lot!That's really reassuring to hear. Thanks so much for your help!You'll have no prob getting into pre-health courses.  It's the computer science department that's over-enrolled like a state school.

During registration, focus on getting a seat in your core classes.  Desired global cores and language classes fill up quickly.Thank you for your advice and for explaining the registration system!Typically in terms of the Core classes you need to take (i.e. the ones the everyone takes)

You should always except to get into those at some capacity, maybe not at your preferred time slot or what have you but they usually expand the class size and let you in if it's a hard requirement like they did for the physics requirement for first year seas students 

In terms of classes for your major, while you're undeclared you aren't given any preference but once you declare in the event you are placed on a waitlist that is instructor managed (which most tend to be) then you'll be of a higher priority than nonmajors on the waitlist. 

This may vary by department and the specific class so I would just email your advisor after memorial day weekend is over to try and get that sorted out. In terms of registration you can check to see when you can register on SSOL and click on reg aptsThank you so much! I really appreciate your time in writing such a detailed response. Also, I am a rising sophomore and it's so great that you mention Barnard because I really wanted to take my Intro Bio courses there (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's the 1500 sequence). If you don't mind me asking, are the Biology courses in a similar waitlist situation or are there any other restrictions I need to know about?You are not allowed to use Barnard bio to fulfill Columbia College major requirements, so if you're majoring in bio or neuroscience and behavior, you will need to take Intro Bio at Columbia (likewise if you are a SEAS BME major). If you are doing a major that doesn't require biology, then you can take Barnard bio. I don't think it's common for either Columbia or Barnard bio to have waitlists.

Barnard science courses do not fulfill the Columbia science requirement, but I'm assuming as a pre-health student that you'll take enough science in the natural course of things that you will fulfill it without particularly trying to.Your first registration appointment will be before the first-years register. If you are a Columbia College student, you will need to sign yourself up for Lit Hum; there will be some space in every section when registration opens to transfer students, so hopefully you can find a time slot that works. Instructors will not yet be listed--just choose days/time that work.

Are you a sophomore? Have you taken a year of General Chemistry? If so, you need to take Intro Bio; most pre-health sophomores double it up with physics and the 1-point physics lab both semesters. PHYS 1201 and, in the spring, 1202, the most basic level, is sufficient for College students and I don't believe there is any advantage to taking a higher level. There should be plenty of space in the class.

It's nice if you can get into a global core; you can put yourself on some wait lists and see what happens. You can try for a spot in The Science of Psychology (PSYC UN1001) or the equivalent Barnard class Intro to Psych (PSYC BC1001). This may also be a waitlist situation, and you may not end up getting in, but you can give it a shot.That's really helpful! I hope there's at least a few spots in any core class.I looked at the LitHum classes and they seemed to have filled up already. I do know you can get an override but it has to be done during class shopping periodCore classes fill up fast so try to get in those even if the time slot isn't so greatThat's really reassuring to hear.

I go to Dodge everyday.I'm gonna completely \*dodge\* your question, and just say this: Dodge Fitness Center reopened with Summer operating hours on Monday, May 23; see the [Hours of Operation page](https://perec.columbia.edu/hours-operation) for more information.Much less than the school year.STEM Student WorkloadIm an incoming CC freshman, and I was just wondering what an average weekly workload for a STEM major is. How many problem sets, exams, labs, etc. do you guys get per week?

Edit: Im used to getting a LOT of work in high school (e.g. two lab reports of 12 pages, two exams, plus stuff for my other non science classes per week)Don't worry about the workload. Learn how to study and seek help immediately when needed(and not waste time). Then you should be fineIm planning on majoring in biochem. I took IB in high school, so I'm hoping that will prepare me at least somewhat for the workload. Thank you for the help!biochem is possibly the heaviest majorthis year only a handful of ppl actually chose to do the biochem major‚Äîi think around 12. physical chemistry is usually the be all end allIs it more problem sets and exams though? i‚Äôm very good at managing stuff like that i just dislike managing heavy amounts of written work.Depends on which major.

I was CS and you can generally count on one homework assignment each week for each CS course. Some courses may have a project as well due at the end of the semester, but with ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù sprinkled in. And almost every class has at least one midterm exam (some have two) and a final.

Math courses usually adhere to the above as well, with problem sets due each week, although I never went beyond linear algebra and ODE, so later courses may be different.

I usually encountered a similar coursework outline for core courses and ‚Äúelectives‚Äù.

And btw, some courses will refer to regular hw as ‚Äúlabs‚Äù (eg Advanced Programming).

It‚Äôs all pretty manageable tbh, just be sure to read the syllabus and don‚Äôt overload yourself.

**Edit:** Random aside, but you should totally take the Shakespeare course if they still offer it. You‚Äôll get a chance to go to the ‚ÄúRare Books‚Äù library and read Shakespeare from an original copy of the first folio and other priceless books.

**Edit 2:** Since you‚Äôre an incoming freshman I‚Äôll add the following advice: assume you‚Äôll spend 10-20 hrs a week on each weekly assignment for each STEM course. You absolutely have to put effort into STEM assignments not only to complete them correctly, but to be prepared for the exams. Exams at Columbia were no joke for me, and all my STEM courses were graded on a curve. It does not feel good to go into an exam unprepared, and you‚Äôll likely fucking bomb if you do.what did you get your MS in?EE, I‚Äôm two credits away from it. But Columbia won‚Äôt let you go without paying tuition. So say, you are getting your MS at Columbia and finish all credits during undergrad, you have to stay for another semester even if you have no class to take.I tried but Columbia out-smarted me. My advisor told me someone a decade ago got away with grinding all the credits early, and the school wasn‚Äôt happy about it. So they added a hard rule to never give two degrees at once.It depends on your goal. I did 21 credits every semester except freshmen year, because I wanted to finish the integrated MS during the four years so that I don‚Äôt need to pay extra tuition. It got really bad because staying in A range took so much effort that I almost had no personal life. It might be easier if your okay with getting A-s or lower but don‚Äôt expect much. If you are spending 9 hours per week per course and you have 7 of them, that means 63 hours of your free time is gone. And if you‚Äôre having lab work on top of that. You‚Äôll end up living my life, which is boring as fk.may i ask what major?Neuroscience, but the premedical coursework takes up as much time as my actual major. Lol.Also, the beginning of the neurosci major is psychology, so it's pretty easy. The end of it is known to be extremely difficult as it gets pretty deep into the neurobio side of things. Bit of a rollercoaster of a major. Love it though.Nice! I was planning to double major with biochem and neuroscience since from what i‚Äôve seen the courses overlap and i‚Äôm interested in both. I‚Äôm not gonna go premed though :)I don't think courses can overlap for two majors, but I could be wrong. Definitely check with your advisor. :) Those are both awesome majorsas a premed stem student, I can say the workload is pretty real. I definitely spent almost all of my time on schoolwork.The number of stuff you have to do doesn't really matter. What matters is how difficult it is. It's easy to have one problem set that takes more time than problem sets for three other classes combined.I‚Äôm going to assume that you took rigorous courses in the IB and have gotten good predicted grades in these courses (enough to get into Columbia) and will get similarly good grades on your actual exams. 

You‚Äôll be fine.

Edit: I would say that HL Chem is harder than gen chem just from what I‚Äôve seen lol.The workload at Fu, and other rigorous academic institutions is no longer just 'busy work'. Most STEM students organize their schedules carefully to balance the known intense courses with lighter ones. This also let's them compete for better marks in their classes.

At Columbia, some of the student body are literal geniuses, and the professors want to challenge those students along with all the rest of you. So, unfortunately, a lot of the homework is just plain hard. Also unfortunately, once you're an upperclassmen, you'll find a lot of this content is so high level, and possibly obscure, that it's difficult to find free* resources to help you complete the work. This is why many students rock a Chegg, probably a good investment.

So, if you're stuck on a problem, and the resources to help you literally don't exist online in an easily digestible format, then you have 3 options: use a teacher, use a friend, use the text. Each of which may or may not be helpful. Unfortunately, you may spend 6-7 hours on a single problem that you have no hope of solving. Doubly unfortunate, now you wasted time that you should have dedicated to other classes. So this will add up quickly.

In summary: balance known hard classes with lighter ones, know your professors, make some friends, get a Chegg. If necessary, learn when to cut your losses. Try and have fun! Lots of the course content is extremely interesting when it's not trying to kill you!biochem is possibly the heaviest majorthis year only a handful of ppl actually chose to do the biochem major‚Äîi think around 12. physical chemistry is usually the be all end allIs it more problem sets and exams though? i‚Äôm very good at managing stuff like that i just dislike managing heavy amounts of written work.Im planning on majoring in biochem.

I'm an incoming freshman and orientation starts August 28th to Sept 5th. How rigid is the orientation schedule? For example, one of my friends (abroad) is visiting NYC coincidentally during orientation week (and will leave before orientation ends) and I was wondering if there would be a possibility to hang out with them during an orientation day in the city since we never get to see each other lol. From peoples' prior past experiences, would that be possible or is orientation jam packed full of activities and required programming that I wouldn't be able to escape for a day? I was looking at the schedule (more info will come out in July) but it seems like Columbia is planning to do immersion experience the Monday and Tuesday of Orientation week and most ideally, I would need to meet my friend on Tuesday... how flexible is the schedules of the immersion experiences? 

I know this is dumb since I should use orientation time to its fullest extent in meeting people and socializing; however, I never see this friend since we live like 5,000 miles away lol. Any advice would be appreciated!

ThanksI even missed some of the mandatory ones for medical reasons. If it‚Äôs that important of an event there will be makeup sessionsThere are a couple of mandatory events like the talks about the school and safety and whatnot. Typically the more social events in the evening are optional.You can skip the events, go have fun!Some events are mandatory, but the vast majority are optional, I wouldn't miss the baseball game though (assuming they do it again)

Some people meet good friends during orientation

Personally I didn't speak to anyone during my orientation

I met my friends just causally one day in the floor lounge and now we are inseparable 

Just be sure to cherish the time you have and to have fun!!I really encourage you to fill up every day and go to every orientation event. But if this really means a lot to you, my recommendation is this: invite your friend to campus, then they can go with your orientation group on one of the NYC outdoor experiences. No one can stop you, so just hang out while on orientation trips! If you‚Äôd really prefer being alone, then just dodge the event and go hang out. The schedule allows for plenty of time to do that.Lifelong friends are made at orientation. Met one of my best friends that first week. Consider going to all the events.regardless of what's the "right" choice, you can even skip the mandatory events and just say you weren't feeling great and there will be no consequences. they'll have makeup sessionsI didn't go to the mandatory events, and literally nothing happened, lol. I think it might preclude you from being an RA or an NSOP leader, but there are always make-up dates if that matters for you. Honestly, I wouldn't stress about it. See your friend! Missing one tiny part of orientation isn't a big deal, and it won't make-or-break your Columbia experience. I personally never even talked to anyone I met at NSOP ever again.go to events- making them up becomes a pain once registration, classes start- CU classes don't start slowly.I even missed some of the mandatory ones for medical reasons. If it‚Äôs that important of an event there will be makeup sessionsCommuting to the medical campus from the main campusHi! I'll be working on the medical campus this summer but living right next to the main undergraduate campus. How do people normally commute to the medical campus? And how long does it usually take? Thank you in advance :))Thank you!I use the intercampus shuttle. It runs on a schedule they‚Äôve posted on their website (plus you can download a wonky app that tracks the shuttles). It‚Äôs free and I prefer it to the subway. Shuttle takes about 20-25 mins, subway takes about 15 mins!Thank you!Also the 4 busAwesome thank you!I‚Äôm in the exact same situation. I live at 113th st but my lab is at the medical campus. I consulted with my CSA advisor and he suggested that I should take the Green line shuttle from 116th st to medical school.Thank you!If you don‚Äôt mind the extra money, the subway is no joke 10 minutes or less. 125th to med campus is 7 minutes for me.Thank you!Thank you!Awesome thank you!Thank you!Cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude GPA for GS?Does anyone know what GPA one should aim for if they wanted to earn cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude for a BA from the School of General Studies, respectively? I'll be graduating in 2025, but information from this year's class or prior classes would be much appreciated. Thank you!Thank you for your response! And I agree, but for me, personally, I would like to do the best I can do considering how much money I'm spending on my education, so graduating with honors is a goal of mine. Equally, though, my health is more important, and I don't want to burn myself out too much.Yes! You have your priorities straight. I don't think you will regret doing your best--what you might regret is, say, planning your schedule around easy As rather than classes that are actually meaningful to you, or burning yourself out (hardly guaranteed to result in fantastic grades, anyway--sometimes quite the opposite). I hope you have a rewarding time at Columbia!That's good advice! Thank you!Latin honors cutoffs vary--a certain percentage of the class receives these honors each year, and the higher the average GPA, the higher the cutoff.

Latin honors are also meaningless. They will make you feel a little warm glow for one day, but to build your life around earning them is simply not worth doing.I'm not certain if I want to go to grad school, but I know that if I go I would want to work for at least 1-2 years after I graduate undergrad. I'm considering law school. My major is history.Just get straight A‚Äôs. 

Maybe sprinkle in a few A+. 

Are you planning on going to a highly selective grad school or PhD after? If not, the effort for A‚Äôs probably isn‚Äôt worth it and you‚Äôd be better off getting practical experience and networking in the time it would take to ace all your classes.Summa was around 4.05 over the pandemic, I heard.

Dumb question but when/how do incoming freshman sign up for classes?Awesome thank you!Incoming first-years sign up during orientation. Columbia College students are pre-registered for Lit Hum and either UWriting or FroSci. (You will have a chance to switch your section if the time ends up not working well for you); SEAS students are pre-registered for either Art of Engineering or UWriting. (I don't know about GS, but I suspect they are not pre-registered for anything.) If you're in CC or SEAS, you will have opportunities to talk to your advisor about what to register for. If you are in SEAS or plan to major in a STEM subject in the College, you may be taking a chemistry placement exam to determine whether you should try one of the accelerated chem tracks; language placement exams are also offered during orientation.Awesome thank you!How do you commute from downtown to Columbia?Hi,

I‚Äôm starting B-school at Columbia this fall and will be living in downtown (around the 34th street). 

What would be the best and quickest way to commute to Columbia from downtown?Yes saw that but isn‚Äôt 1 quite slow? Commute time could be 45 mins each way?it can be. can also take the express up to 96 and then swap to 1. that should be quicker for that distanceTaking the 2/3 up to 96 will maybe save you 5 minutes max. I‚Äôd rather sit on the 1 and read a book.it can be slow, but definitely not 45 mins each way. more like 20 on a regular dayAs others have said, taking the 2/3 up to 96th St and switching to the 1 can save you a bit of time (though probably not more than 5m).what‚Äôs your nearest subway line? assuming it‚Äôs penn station, get on the express and transfer to the 1 at 96This is the fastest way to get up or down town. There would have to be major delays or it would have to be the middle of the night with no traffic for any above ground transportation to be as fast as the train. I too would suggest getting an express train through 96th but the others suggesting reasons for riding the local the whole way aren‚Äôt wrong either.Yup. Plan accordingly.I've taken the 1 from Penn many times and it's usually around 30 minsDowntown where?More like 20 mins plus walking, could be more like 30 depending on delays or if it's just crowded. The 1 is local but it's otherwise quite fast. e-Bike could also be an option when the subway is having issues, would be about 35 minutes.You can take the 2 or 3 express trains up to 96th and swap to the 1, that‚Äôs what I do when I go farther downtown. They usually arrive at the same time or almost the same time to where you can just walk across to switch trains.You will not find anything faster than the 1 unless you have a good mile time. If you don‚Äôt like a 45 minute commute, consider moving north and living closer to campus.Maybe 5 minutes max. I‚Äôd rather stay on the 1 and read a bookThat said, 34th St Penn station should be more like 30m, not 45m.Yes nearest subway station is PennI'd rather take express, it's a lot more peaceful when there aren't stops every two minutes.Fellow 34th street commuter here. You have to time the 2 and 3 trains  just right when you connect to the 1 train at 96th. Nothing worse than missing the subway and just having to take the one local.Take the A dude. Any mapping application would have told you that.I take the 1 all the way up. Just use Google Maps.I used to commute from 42nd and usually the 1 took around 15 minutes, so it shouldn‚Äôt be too bad.

(For context, I just graduated from CC and I'm going to work in tech.) I don't really want to ask the post-docs how much they make, but could someone give me an idea of the general salary in a STEM group at Columbia? Is the amount set by the university, department, or is it up to the professor?

I'm curious because I am considering getting a PhD in the future and I'll probably do a post-doc, but it's hard to have an idea of income levels as a post-doc because having that convo can be uncomfortable (i.e. people are weird about money.) Also, are post-docs at Columbia allowed to take classes for credit? I know some institutions allow this, but others don't.Check glass door for references of salaries. For government funded projects (eg NIH), often salaries for post docs are based in federal guidelines. You can Google these too - just note that these recommended salary brackets are scaled nation wide, so it‚Äôs not great money for NYC. A post doc might be able to negotiate for more $$ if the prof/lab has it, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed and based on how competitive you are as a candidate. Overall, in my field (psych) you don‚Äôt go into a post doc (or academia in general) for the moneyIn my group in physics, postdocs get 65-75k, depending on the grant they are on. There's not really room for negotiation, as the PIs have no control over this.

I'm sure you can join in on classes, but why would you need credit? You're a scientist, not a student.Laptop reccs for CS majorHey guys, was looking for a laptop to pick up before starting school this sept, and did some research for laptops good for CS and development. So far narrowed it down to framework laptop and MBA, what do u guys think? I heard MBA has compatability issues with Excel, but being Unix based would be rly good for learning. Would u guys still go with Mac? Also, do u think I should wait till the m2 MBA in June or something.

Thanks!I don't think I've heard CS majors with Macs ever complain, but hopefully one of them comments. I use Excel on Mac and it works perfectly, no compatibility issues there. And yes, Apple may announce a new MBA next week at their conference, so I would wait for that at least. Make sure to use education pricing as well!Mac as an excel app from the app store so I don't believe compatibility is an issueYou can't really go wrong with either. If you plan to use an iPad for readings and notes, iCloud makes it a lot easier to keep things in sync between devices.I have an M1 MBA and it's been fine for the most part. There are a little bit of issues as you mentioned with Excel - main thing being Power Query, some of it just doesn't work as well as it does on Windows. But apart from that, MBA M1 is a fine machine. I've also been thinking of getting a Thinkpad and making a full time Ubuntu machine as well.M1 Air is perfect laptop.

Certain industries (finance, consulting) are notorious for early application timelines, as well as more intensive and specialized processes that you should have some familiarity with. Most other places you're going to be applying much closer to your actual graduation date and with more typical requirements.So what about December graduates?A few companies have programs that start in January.

But besides work study, I was wondering if there is actually on/off campus job that is available for fall... I heard of library and gym, and i think we can apply when they open up in fall, but what can be the other options? For my undergrad in other college I would work in dining hall, but seems like TC doesn't have that option available for student. (or maybe I'm just bad at searching...) 

If there is, when should I start applying for it?

Let‚Äôs goInterestedSocial Life at Barnard?Hi, potential Barnard transfer here. What is the social life really like for Barnard students, and how hard is it to talk to other kids off campus? I went to a uni in a big college city and could see kids all across different colleges in my area pretty often, and I oftentimes had friend groups from different universities. I would love to have a group of friends at Barnard but I also like being friends with male-identifying individuals (particularly LGBT ones) and want to know what it's like talking to kids that don't go to your school. TIA!I don't think you will have any issue making friends with men, because the rest of Columbia is coed and for the most part, campus life is mixed across all schools. 

As for people in other universities, you should meet them more (as well as other non-student adults) if you go into the city. Because you have the entire city open to you, the social life at this school is in large part what you make of it (the flip side is a lack of cohesive campus culture). Personally speaking, some student clubs might also welcome people not from Columbia, which is how I met a lot of non-Columbia people, but I feel like this is the exception rather than the norm.The cool thing about Barnard is that not only do you have full access to Columbia, but to all of NYC. I think a college experience in NYC is amazing and so unique because the city itself is amazing and unique. You have a looot of options for where to go out (clubs, etc.), or get dinner, or go to a museum, etc. Your relationship with the other colleges at Columbia is really up to you: how involved you get with the general university environment or stay within the Barnard community is up to you, and both are great options depending on what your "scene" is. If you're wondering about kids off campus that aren't Columbia affiliated, then I don't know as much about that. But interacting with NYU, Fordham, FIT, Parsons, CUNY, Juilliard kids, etc. happens particularly when you go out, and I'm sure it's not too difficult to make friends across universities.

Wishing you the best with your decision! :)When is the deadline to apply to the Graduate Housing (waitlist) for Fall 2022?^Housing for Barnard?So I am thinking of transferring to Barnard but as a transfer I'm not guaranteed housing. What is off-campus housing like, in comparison to other big cities in dense areas on the coast like LA, Boston, SF, etc.? Being in NYC I expect it to be expensive, and maybe particularly bc it's Morningside Heights, and I don't really know what FB groups to join or what to do lol. Also I heard about an incident where a low-income student started a fire and got her guaranteed housing taken away. I'm curious how one would find off-campus housing last-minute like in situations like that.You're not guaranteed housing, but typically all that means for transfers is that you'll have to wait to see what housing you get. Sometimes you might even end up with really good housing for your class year because someone else doesn't need it anymore.

There are Columbia off campus housing groups on Facebook. That said, my friends just found their apartments off of StreetEasy/Zillow. More short-term subletting off of other students might be an option too of course.

As for the fire, the person who started the fire was placed on probation and is banned from housing starting this fall, so it's not a last-minute situation for her. After public outcry, she was also able to appeal and get the ban down to a single academic year, but as an FGLI student she still can't afford that - I believe people did a GoFundMe to help her afford housing.

Please feel free to dm me if you prefer.Yeah,I emailed them and I‚Äôm waiting on their response.

Individual circumstances can vary, and being international complicates things. They're the best source of truth available and have been very helpful/nice in my experience.Got it,Thank you!If you‚Äôre aid is more than tuition and fees, room and board, you will get a refund. Incoming students on full aid normally have a 2400 summer work expectation. You normally won‚Äôt have to pay that to the school, it might just be to cover books and things like that. But if your aid still exceeds the cost of attendance (tuition, fees( like service fees) , room and board) then you‚Äôd get a refund.
