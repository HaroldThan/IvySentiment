Next week, the Class of 2026 will receive their RD Decisions for Penn (Thursday, March 31, 2022, 7PM EDT). This thread will be used as a centralized Decision Reaction and Q&A Thread. Posts with specific questions about Penn will still be allowed. Other posts, including but not limited to Internal Transfer and Penn vs. XXXX posts, generic housing questions, questions that can be easily googled, and general reactions to admissions, will be deleted and the OPs will be sent here.

Welcome to r/upenn!

Please read the subreddit rules on the sidebar if you are new to the subreddit.

Good luck to all those waiting for their decisions!

Current students and alumni: Please check this thread to answer any questions.Rejected ‚Äò26 ü•≥Hey y'all. International student from Lebanon here!! Got into CAS as a prospective neuroscience major! So excited to meet you guysDo they say that, ‚Äú We have enjoyed getting to know you through this process‚Äù to all student or it‚Äôs saying, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll receive our rejection letter on March 31, so make ur decisions in another college‚ÄùAdmitted waitlist ‚Äò24 here. I wrote a strong letter of continued interest (basically saying I would attend if accepted and updating penn with any new ECs). I also got another strong letter of rec tho it can be difficult to find someone willing to do this at this point.I'm an admitted waitlist'23. write a strong LOCi that highlight how you have continued to spend time in activities you wrote about in your application or even new ones. Also highlight new things about penn that you like from additional research. Essentially, it should be a continuation of your original application.Omg I don't think I'll have a problem getting 1 - or even 2 new LORs - bc I've recently had major EC achievements (representing my country in a student research competition for my intended major). I'll also be attending an information session on the 4th - hope I'm able to get in!hi! im currently waitlisted and sent in my loci to the portal. I was wondering if you also emailed it to the admissions office.On what date did you get the letter that you were an admitted waitlist?How long after did you wait before sending the LOCi?? In other words essentially when should you send it by before it's too late???hi! im currently waitlisted and sent in my loci to the portal. I was wondering if you also emailed it to the admissions office.May 7this is a while ago and i honestly don't fully remember. I think I sent it around early may? Could be wrong tho. Basically admission officers prob look at waitlists after the admits make their decision, which is during MayI don't believe I did. Not necessarythanks!Students at Penn who got in off the waitlist - what do you think worked for you? Currently waitlisted at CASit‚Äôs a bit more backed up rn, but should be well before decision day!! i submitted mine late too and they took abt 2-3 weeks :)Okay, I submitted mine a day before decision day, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôll take a week or twoI submitted my financial aid documents on 3/30, a day before decisions were released. Now that I am admitted, how long will it take for my financial aid offer to be ready?hi, i‚Äôm not trans myself but am v involved in the minority board at penn who represents non-cis students+women, if u wanna dm i can answer some questions and ask my trans friends some others :)For living situation, there's the option to select "gender inclusive" housing, which will get you placed with other(s) who selected that option, regardless of gender/AGAB. There are also plenty of singles available.

You can find a pretty comprehensive list of trans resources [here](https://lgbtc.vpul.upenn.edu/transresources/). I'd recommend checking out what Student Health Services can do for you re: medical transition, and reading through the coverage for trans health if you're planning on using the Penn health insurance.That would be amazing, thank you sm!!Are you trans yourself? If so, how easy was it to access hormones and any gender affirming surgeries once you were on UPenn‚Äôs campus? Is Penn itself a pretty good with changing names and using preferred names? Sorry for all the questions, I‚Äôm just really nervous about this whole process and don‚Äôt know if Penn will be the safest optionHow is the trans community at UPenn? I‚Äôm a transman who‚Äôs recently began medically transitioning. I haven‚Äôt had top surgery yet, but plan to once I‚Äôm 18 (after first semester). What is the living situation like on campus? How‚Äôs the overall environment around trans folx? Any advice would really help, thank you so much.At Penn, you can major in CS from within CAS! The condition is that you have to have another major within CAS to be able to do this (as in, you can‚Äôt only major in CS unless you are in SEAS). But considering you want another humanities major anyway, I don‚Äôt think this would be an issue! I have a few friends doing this and it seems to work out well!Congrats on all the acceptances! I made a late transfer from CAS to SEAS. As long as your classes first year are compatible with an engineering curriculum and you get B or up in your core classes for your new program, you'll transfer just fine. I literally filled out what was Penn's equivalent of a Google form and got an email back that I made it a month later, so not a super involved process.

On a separate note, people talk a lot about different lvls of prestige within the ivies, but I wouldn't make it a factor in your choice between Cornell/Penn/Brown. I can't think of any opportunity (jobs, internships, conferences, etc) outside the school itself and the city it's in that youd have at Penn but not Cornell, so I say (as a very happy CS major at Penn) consider choosing more closely based on which school personally interests you more than prestige. Dm if you have any questions!Also going to add that from what I've seen, so long as you take the required intro math/science courses that engineering freshmen take and maintain a decent GPA, it seems pretty straightforward to transfer to SEAS.Update: Committed to Penn! Planning to do economics/cs from CAS. Going to try it out freshman year and then decide if I want to switch to SEAS.Can I be rejected from being able to do this?  Is there a GPA requirement?I am accepted to the class of 2026 at CAS, I am thinking about switching major to CS or CE at engineering school. can you kindly point me to the link where it shows the required classes that I need to take to be able to eligible for the transfer? thank you!!I looked it up and seems like you need a B in CIS 120 (intro CS class) and 3.0 GPA. But I think as long as you meet the requirements you can add it. Adding this major is not like transferring between schools (for transferring there‚Äôs an official application and its not guaranteed you get it).All the info you need is here: https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/undergraduate-policies/transfer-in-to-penn-engineering/Is CIS 120 a difficult class? I have prior programming experience and I took AP Comp Sci.Thank you so much! This is very helpful! Have a great day!No, not necessarily. But that being said, similar to other majors, most classes and their difficulty matter more about workload than content, since usually there are enough resources (TA office hours, prof office hours, looking stuff up online) that can help people get through the course content, but the sheer workload can definitely be a challenge. This is something that can be seen in CIS160 and CIS121, where the content itself isn't necessarily that difficult (well, for first timers, it can be difficult, but for people who have been introduced to the concepts before, it isn't too bad), but the workload is high enough where people can end up having a very bad time with the class.

In general though, the difficulty of a major *mostly* depends on your aptitude to be studious, especially if you're in SEAS. That being said, the requirements for majoring in CS in CAS is generally easier, which is quite nice, but as u/musicTux said above, you do need to major in something else in CAS, which could be difficult.

Also on a different note about CS, from my experience, CS at penn is quite theory focused, and I personally haven't had very much coding in classes that I actually enjoyed, but YMMV. I'm sure other people have different opinions here, but I feel confident in saying that majoring in CS will take a pretty significant amount of studying for the average student (and the higher you want your gpa to be, the more you would have to study).just an FYI, if u do go the penn CS route in the college, try to have a solid idea of what ur non-CS major is gonna be or at least a solid ‚Äògroup‚Äô of potentially interesting majors- college requirements can make it so that you have to plan ur majors pretty well but u def have wiggle room!! SEAS w/ a college minor in humanities or just a lot of humanities courses might be a bit easier imo but if u truly want a double major it‚Äôs doable!I have a major dilemma. 

I was very fortunate to get into UPenn, Brown, and Cornell. For context, I have interests in both CS and humanities. I will probaly major in CS. One of my main priorities in college is to be heavily involved in research (both with professors and classmates). But here is the dilemma.  
  
UPenn:  
  
At Penn, CS is in the engineering school. I was denied from a Penn dual degree program where you could combine a CS major with a major from arts and sciences. However, I got into Penn arts and sciences (my second choice since I thought this would give me more options). Now, to major in CS, I would have to either do an uncoordinated double major which requires a petition/good GPA or transfer to the engineering school. This seems very difficult to do. Would it be a risky move to attend UPenn?  
  
Cornell:  
  
Cornell permits students to major in CS from arts and sciences or engineering, which is exactly what I want. But should I give up UPenn for Cornell? People are telling me to 100% go to UPenn as they see it as more prestigious. Maybe this is biased information since I come from a NY school where lots of people go to Cornell.  
  
Brown:  
  
Permits students to major in CS from arts and sciences or engineering. Super flexible cirriculum if I change my mind. Did not expect to get in here at all, so I am not familiar with the quality of the CS department compared to UPenn/Cornell. Also, the CS major here seems more collaborative/low stress than UPenn/Cornell.  
  
Should I give up UPenn for Cornell/Brown because internal transfer or double majoring across schools is difficult?View in your timezone:

[0]: https://timee.io/20220331T2300?tl=Class%20of%202026%20RD%20Admissions%20ThreadAnyone get civic scholars? Does everyone get to apply to BFS in the college?Penn M&T vs Duke Full Ride vs Stanford vs Princeton vs Berkeley MET for ECE/CS and Econ (Business School for M&T and MET)

Hello! I just wanted to hop in and ask for some advice in choosing a school, as I‚Äôve narrowed my choice down to these 5 schools. My parents are willing to cover the costs of any of the schools, but I‚Äôm thinking Duke is the obvious choice since the full ride makes it ~$100k cheaper than my next most expensive (M&T is actually my most expensive option and would cost me ~$180k more than Duke). My parents also said they‚Äôd be happy to give me some of the difference in cost for personal use, which I‚Äôd probably invest with.

For the intangibles, I really like the vibes of Stanford and Duke best, followed by Berkeley, followed by Princeton and Penn. The good weather and school spirit were definitely draws for me at the non ivies. I also don‚Äôt care too much about urban vs suburban, as it seems that all the schools have enough to do on campus anyways.

For my goals, I hope to enter the startup world after graduating, but I‚Äôve gotten the sense that M&T and Princeton are more finance oriented (please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). Berkeley MET is so new that it‚Äôs hard to tell how well it prepares students, whereas I know Stanford is amazing for startups especially with its location and entrepreneurial culture. Duke also seems to be really strong in entrepreneurship (I read that the founders of unicorn startups like Coinbase, Neuralink, Airtable, Plaid, Cameo, etc. were all in the same years at Duke), so should I just pull the trigger for Duke or am I missing something about Penn? My issue is that I really like the M&T program as it offers exactly what I want to study, but I don‚Äôt like Penn as a school nearly as much as I like Stanford/Duke (or even Berkeley). Thanks!YupyeahAnyone else in the NETS program?Congrats everyone!Congrats!! You can still upload, I literally accepted my spot without having a financial aid package ready lolThank you! Also how generous is Penn‚Äôs financial aid?It‚Äôs very generous IMO! If it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre expecting, you can always appeal and have them look at it again, but I‚Äôve fortunately never been in that position as they‚Äôve put my package together very well!Ty! after i commented i looked at the penn finaid website and saw their meeting 100% demonstrated need policy ü§ì I guess i‚Äôll just cross my fingers and hope their efc is similar to what my fafsa saysI forgot to upload the financial aid documents that werent my FAFSA and CSS‚Ä¶.

The main penn disc for co 26is there a gc or discordHi! I got waitlisted. Realistically, what are my chances? And does anyone who has gotten of the UPenn waiting list have any advice?Hey everyone! I got accepted to CAS as an International student from India. Delighted to be a part of your beautiful community!CAS as an international student from Canada!! Intending to major Econ and Polisci :-) SO excitedAre UPenn students actually depressed? Penn seems to be ranked as having one of the most depressed student bodies, and I‚Äôm wondering if this is based on the course loads or other factors. Thank you for any help:)Hey Guys! I got waitlisted from UPenn and so I am completing my LOCI. Would be extremely grateful if ya'll can please suggest to me some individuals, firms or companies who might be able to help me out in editing my UPenn LOCI for free?Hey Guys! I wanted your suggestions on this. Can you please suggest specific things that I should add about UPenn such as the environment, the people, my department (CAS) to my LOCI as I was waitlisted for 2026? All comments would be appreciated.  
\#GoQuakersGo to Williams, leave UPenn for us waitlists :)))) >!/jk!<Fresh off the waitlist! Debating between Williams and UPenn CAS rn :)got off the waitlist on friday :)!! so excitedDoes anyone have any advice for getting off the waitlist for Wharton?You were admitted to the entire school of engineering and you can choose any major you would like within that. You can declare a major at any point during your freshman year. It is also easy to change majors within engineering as a freshmanI will add that if you applied as an intended major (and not curriculum deferred) you come in declared as that major unless/until you change it. So yes, you're now in the major you applied for :) Thank you so much!I was admitted to SEAS for engineering, but in my admission letter it never said exactly what department I‚Äôm in. Is it assumed that I got into what I applied for, or is it like some colleges where you specify a type of engineering after freshmen year, or am I missing something?[deleted]>gahahshbdns

Just looking at your past responses you seem to have a biased view **Against** PENN. Literally every comparison you've ever posted has been against UPENN ie: you said that (Brown > Penn, Berkeley > Penn, Yale > Penn, Northwestern > Penn, Cornell > Penn ... and a lot more). Perhaps you just had a bad experience, but stop trying to generalize it to everyone lolol. Like literally all your comment history is just telling people to not go to PENN in any scenario.plz help me decide between yale and upenn:
 
My major factors are social vibe (party scene) and general feel on campus. academically, i‚Äôm going to major in neuroscience on a pre-med track.Anyone else Vagelos MLS?what major in SEAS r u interested in? some majors may be offered in both the college and SEAS[deleted]ah, CS is offered in the college as well! there‚Äôs no general engineering major in SEAS but if u wanna weigh options there‚Äôs a comment thread under this same thread where ppl who r more knowledgeable abt CS @ penn talk abt BA vs SEAS transfer for CS and double majoring, i‚Äôd check it out[deleted][deleted]Berkeley is not the way to go IMO:

1) Huge public school. You'll be going to class with 400+ kids have little time to work on projects with professors, and leave without any connections. It's like a dogfight to get out of there ready for your career

2) Quality of class. Berkeley is definitely less selective (everyone in my school that applied got in this year while we had only 1 UPENN acceptance)

3) Cost: UPENN is much more generous with fin aid if you need it.

UPENN also preps you very well for a career!Penn Physics students: how is the major for an undergrad? Ofc the rankings say one thing and prestige is another but do you feel that you‚Äôre getting your worth?

Literally every comparison you've ever posted has been against UPENN ie: you said that (Brown > Penn, Berkeley > Penn, Yale > Penn, Northwestern > Penn, Cornell > Penn ... and a lot more). Perhaps you just had a bad experience, but stop trying to generalize it to everyone lolol. Like literally all your comment history is just telling people to not go to PENN in any scenario.ah, CS is offered in the college as well! there‚Äôs no general engineering major in SEAS but if u wanna weigh options there‚Äôs a comment thread under this same thread where ppl who r more knowledgeable abt CS @ penn talk abt BA vs SEAS transfer for CS and double majoring, i‚Äôd check it out[deleted]Berkeley is not the way to go IMO:

1) Huge public school. You'll be going to class with 400+ kids have little time to work on projects with professors, and leave without any connections. It's like a dogfight to get out of there ready for your career

2) Quality of class. Berkeley is definitely less selective (everyone in my school that applied got in this year while we had only 1 UPENN acceptance)

3) Cost: UPENN is much more generous with fin aid if you need it.

UPENN also preps you very well for a career!May 7this is a while ago and i honestly don't fully remember. I think I sent it around early may? Could be wrong tho. Basically admission officers prob look at waitlists after the admits make their decision, which is during Maythanks!I don't believe I did. Not necessaryIs CIS 120 a difficult class? I have prior programming experience and I took AP Comp Sci.No, not necessarily. But that being said, similar to other majors, most classes and their difficulty matter more about workload than content, since usually there are enough resources (TA office hours, prof office hours, looking stuff up online) that can help people get through the course content, but the sheer workload can definitely be a challenge. This is something that can be seen in CIS160 and CIS121, where the content itself isn't necessarily that difficult (well, for first timers, it can be difficult, but for people who have been introduced to the concepts before, it isn't too bad), but the workload is high enough where people can end up having a very bad time with the class.

In general though, the difficulty of a major *mostly* depends on your aptitude to be studious, especially if you're in SEAS. That being said, the requirements for majoring in CS in CAS is generally easier, which is quite nice, but as u/musicTux said above, you do need to major in something else in CAS, which could be difficult.

Also on a different note about CS, from my experience, CS at penn is quite theory focused, and I personally haven't had very much coding in classes that I actually enjoyed, but YMMV. I'm sure other people have different opinions here, but I feel confident in saying that majoring in CS will take a pretty significant amount of studying for the average student (and the higher you want your gpa to be, the more you would have to study).just an FYI, if u do go the penn CS route in the college, try to have a solid idea of what ur non-CS major is gonna be or at least a solid ‚Äògroup‚Äô of potentially interesting majors- college requirements can make it so that you have to plan ur majors pretty well but u def have wiggle room!! SEAS w/ a college minor in humanities or just a lot of humanities courses might be a bit easier imo but if u truly want a double major it‚Äôs doable!I looked it up and seems like you need a B in CIS 120 (intro CS class) and 3.0 GPA. But I think as long as you meet the requirements you can add it. Adding this major is not like transferring between schools (for transferring there‚Äôs an official application and its not guaranteed you get it).Thank you so much! This is very helpful!

thanks in advance!oh awesome, thanks for the info!I also submitted that day. I believe we should have it by the end of this month. June 25 was the date last  year I think so should be similar this yearwhat do we need to submit ‚Äî just fafsa, pfas, and CSS right? I haven‚Äôt gotten mine yet either and I was thinking maybe I forgot to submit something?oh awesome, thanks for the info!At Penn over the summerHello!! I got into one of Penn‚Äôs High School Summer Academies. I was wondering, what is the best way to get to Fagin Hall from 30th Street Station? I could walk but it‚Äôs a 25 minute walk and in the case I am running late or something I want to be able to have a faster way.Two options
1.	37th station is closer to Fagin, but it puts you kinda smack dab in the middle of the Quad, so you have to walk around the quad (on either side) to get to Hamilton walk. Then, from there, walk to the Biomed library (Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine - Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion). Walk through the lobby to the other side and Fagin is right there
2.	36th street station puts you further from Fagin, but you can walk straight down to Hamilton Walk (where you‚Äôd turn left and walk a really short bit until the RWJ Pavilion is on your left). Do the same and walk through to get to fagin


Not sure if you‚Äôve been to Fagin yet, but just wanted to let you know about the shortcut through the lobby of the RWJ Pavilion because Google Maps (and other apps) will take you all the way around the block and its so not necessary hahaOmg thank you so much! Yeah, I have never been. I have done dual enrollment at Penn but I was at Hayden which is near so many buses.Trolley 11/13/34/36 to 37th is best. Busses 30/49/42 could work if you see one but septa busses are slowYeah I am taking regional rail but not all trains stop at penn MedIf you're coming via SEPTA Regional Rail your better plan is to get off at Penn Med instead of 30th Street, if you're on a line that stops there. If you're arriving at 30th Street via the El, you could transfer to the 52 bus, but with waiting, you likely won't save any time.No. What is that?The Loop Through University City http://www4.septa.org/schedules/bus/pdf/LUCY.pdfLucy Gold has a stop right in front of the station that brings right you to the area around FaginHave you looked at the Lucy bus?Not all trains go to Penn Med so it makes my life 10x more difficult üò©. I would have to get off then take the airport line to Penn Med.Then just go to 30th and take the 30th street trolley to 36thDo you think I could take the 21 to 36th and then walk?Imo You‚Äôd be better off walking than taking the bus sinc ebusses only run every 30 min‚Äî I‚Äôd say trolley bc they run like every 5 minutes and every trolley except the 10 can drop you off at 36thOkay Perfect!

Thanks!University of Pennsylvania Students Federal Credit UnionDoes anyone have experience with the Students Federal Credit Union? How are services and fees there? Is it worth opening up an account there compared to a bank like Bank of America or PNC? What are the best banks in Penn's proximity?Biggest complaints with SFCU that a big bank may be able to avoid are: 

1. Since the students run it, I've had a couple times I've had a hard time getting service. Ex: I needed a new debit card over the summer living in Mexico and I couldn't get it till I came back to Philly, but a bigger bank may be able to process that.

2. During the summer in Philly, I couldn't go in to get a cashier's check without making an appointment (again students run it) and it seemed they had some trouble getting someone to come in for the appointment (but I did get serviced).

All in all positive experience tho and even if service is harder to get, I conjecture that the service I got was higher quality since the workers are peers who likely care more about your well being and the credit union's image than the average teller does at a bigger bank.Thank you for telling me the pros and cons! I plan to study abroad in the future, so I think the international convenience that a bank offers might be more important. But, I'm glad to hear that the experience is positive!Proud SFCU member here! Haven't had an account at PNC, but I'm mostly satisfied with what I've got from SFCU. The tradeoffs are what you'd expect for a local credit union compared to a national bank, PNC has more structured and wide-spread services while SFCU has more homey, local services. I couldn't give a list but an example of this trade off may be PNC has more branches in many places so you tend to be a lot closer to someone you can talk to face-to-face away from campus, but SFCU is local enough to be able to mail physical checks for you to pay bills as long as you schedule it in advance (my friends who bank with the big banks tell me they don't get this service). I'm not an expert but happy to answer any questions as an average member at SFCUThanks for the warning!I love.SFCU. i had a PNC account which I closed because of awful PNC is. Get anything but PNC, personally SFCU works like a charm.I used BoA and PNC. Liked BoA more. Fees are waived for a student account and their credit card is quite good. Also their online portal is great.

I am worried about getting the nutrition and protein I need through the free meals that come with clubs/events/workshops/program communities/etc.  

Thoughts?how do you make dal? I just use an instantpot since you don't need to watch it cook... sometimes I set it to cook while I'm in class and then it's done when I get back.... and then use the stove to do a quick tarka/chhonk (obviously not possible in all college houses)... but I think one with a kitchenette might be something to consider if you hope to follow a particular diet.Wow that sounds like a great setup!  Thanks for the insight!!once you're on the meal plan, you can get access to a dietician that may be able to help you navigate eating options.

IMO, I'd just try to get off the meal plan altogether citing your concerns. (A doctor's note may help!)   

Vegan options are 'meh' and can feel monotonous after some time, esp depending on your own culinary background.  Depending on your protein target, dining hall options may be insufficient.  I might recommend protein supplements if you're truly worried... suppose you could have a stockpile of store-bought hummus, but I made a habit of just making some daily dal for a breakfast meal... that way I didn't have to worry throughout the day if options were suboptimal.I will hop in to say that even if you regret your dining plan choice, you can switch within the first week. 
That being said, go for the dining dollars. As someone who has done vegan on campus for the last two years, it‚Äôs good to know that I can supplement with Gourmet Grocer / Starbucks etc.  Campus isn‚Äôt super vegan friendly but dining dollars unlock a whole bunch of options (such as bagel sandwich @ Joes Cafe or zucchini bread @ Houston market)Previous post on being vegan at Penn: https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/orfcuh/vegan_penn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

But regardless of dietary preferences, always go maximum dining dollars, because you never run out of swipes. Specifically regarding vegan food, dining hall vegan food gets repetitive and is bland, but you can use dining dollars to buy vegan meals and snacks at gourmet grocer.the high sodium meat lovers planDon't come to Penn I just use an instantpot since you don't need to watch it cook... sometimes I set it to cook while I'm in class and then it's done when I get back.... and then use the stove to do a quick tarka/chhonk (obviously not possible in all college houses)... but I think one with a kitchenette might be something to consider if you hope to follow a particular diet.Wow that sounds like a great setup!

Would appreciate any knowledge about a comparison of factors between the two, such as which is harder to get into, whether a degree in SEAS or Wharton is more useful, amount of coursework in each school, ease of internal transfer, etc.Thanks. I actually was not thinking about applying to something else just to transfer to Wharton later. I think I‚Äôm actually more interested in engineering rather than business.Please don't apply to SEAS because you think you'll be able to transfer easily into Wharton. That's not the case and you might be stuck doing something you don't like.

My advice: apply to whichever you like the most and aligns more with your interests and future career goals.Why do you think so, if you don‚Äôt mind sharing?SEASHard to say which is harder to get into, obv Wharton is more famous but my year SEAS actually had the lower acceptance rate (according to the Engineering Dean, anyway). The easier one to get into is whichever one your applicant profile best fits.

Which degree is more "useful" depends heavily on your interests. What kinds of careers appeal to you? Which courses do you enjoy more?

I will say an engineering degree is arguably more versatile - either school can get you into finance or consulting if you play your cards right, but a Wharton degree alone won't get you a job designing aircraft, for instance.You still have to pick which school you want to consider you if they reject you from the dual degree (or take the all-or-nothing and opt to just get rejected in that case, ig)Apply to dual degree and decide laterDo whatever you are more passionate about, period. Even if you get the most prestigious degree in economy/finances from Wharton, it won‚Äôt make you rich or happy if your real passion was engineering. Trust me, I have been down that road.Wharton and seas cultures are very differentSeas = lots of work
Wharton = much less work, more networking 
Probably about the same of getting in, maybe wharton is a little more competitive to get in. Cultures are very dependent on college house, but probably different between Wharton and seas too. 
I would guess transferring to wharton is harder, but cant confirm. Have a few friends from the college that transferred to seas, albeit they had very high gpasIt really really depends on what you wanna do. Basic info: wharton harder to get in compared to seas, coursework in wharton is lighter, transferring from wharton to seas is easy but seas to wharton is not, usefulness depends wholly on what you want to doSEASa degree in SEAS is probably more useful for everything except a long term career in IB.... for example north of 70% of all partners in VC have an undergraduate hard science or engineering degree while only 25%-30% of all managing directors in IB have an undergraduate hard science or engineering degree (this is a stat straight out of a book we read for a Venture Capital class in Wharton)

and if you plan to pursue a long term career in research or high tech entrepreneurship, then SEAS or something STEM in CAS is the best betThanks. I actually was not thinking about applying to something else just to transfer to Wharton later. I think I‚Äôm actually more interested in engineering rather than business.Why do you think so, if you don‚Äôt mind sharing?You still have to pick which school you want to consider you if they reject you from the dual degree (or take the all-or-nothing and opt to just get rejected in that case, ig)Wharton and seas cultures are very differentSTAT 471 vs CIS 519/520Planning on taking one of these for my data science minor. I understand that they both count towards the same requirement, but I was wondering if it would be too redundant to take both, as then I could count CIS 519/520 as an elective for my CIS minor. I feel like data mining and machine learning are not the same thing and would be interested in learning both, but if the course materials are very similar, then which one would be better to take?520 is more rigorous than 519, which is more rigorous than 471. Recommend 519 or 520 if you want to learn more applicable approaches that can be applied in industry, versus 471, which can be followed along with the colabs/code blocks they provide.named scholarshipjust received an update to my finaid saying i got a named scholarship in lieu of my penn grant its called the tisch college fund ‚Ä¶. do i have to do anything about that???No, it shouldn't make a difference for you. Named scholarships are just from big alumni donations, so they might invite you to an event with the donors but that's about it.Practicing EnglishHi , I'm on research scholar . International graduate, i wonder if there any activities to help International student improve their English.I would say join a club. Audit a linguistics course. Or just go to events in the city . Welcome ü§óImmersion. Talk to people. Go to restaurants and order food. Stuff like that.It's Philly so take advantage of the city. Go to bars and coffeeshops, talk to your Uber drivers, make conversation with the food truck people, etc..... I grew up in America but before coming to Penn, I dealt with some stuttering issues. But interacting with the city more improved my speech tenfold.It feels as if I've wasted my university experienceI'm sorry for this post. I'm not trying to fish for sympathy, I  guess I just need to vent. I'm currently a rising senior, but I can't say I've spent my time at Penn adequately, especially in regards to what to do after graduation. I know my marks are good and I have had a couple leadership positions, but that's it. I haven't had an internship because there were never any opportunities in the area I was interested in, so I've been taking classes both this summer and last. I'm hoping to get into a good graduate school, but it feels like the clubs I've been a part of won't help show my strengths. I also don't feel as if I've built any strong connections with any professors. And some opportunities I was interested in I had only discovered once the deadline had passed. Now with senior year approaching, I don't know what to do to stand out. Just... yeah...if it makes you feel any better i know more people who graduated penn feeling like u than the oppositeJust having that name on your degree is going to open a lot of doors for you.Be easy on yourself. You‚Äôve endured a pandemic and arguably the most turbulent four years of the last several decades. I‚Äôm an old head and I think it‚Äôs fairly common to feel pangs of regret when you‚Äôre about to graduate. I know I certainly did.The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is right nowI just finished grad school and I‚Äôm weighing job options now but I had a similar experience to you. I never even applied for an internship my whole life became I wasn‚Äôt interested and I just took extra classes over the summer. By the sound of it, you aren‚Äôt just looking for some cookie cutter business or finance career, you‚Äôre looking for something unique and new. Don‚Äôt worry, once that job comes out, if you are prepared for it, you‚Äôll have success. You don‚Äôt need an internship for those special kind of jobs. There are very few candidates for those unique jobs as I have found out and not many are the right fit. When people talk about needing internships it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre going for those super competitive roles that everyone wants. Best of luck to you and stay positive! Don‚Äôt give up no matter what!

PS - if you haven‚Äôt already, consider looking at startups. Since they are new companies, they often have unique roles to develop their new products.if it makes you feel any better, many people here are getting a liberal art educationLooking for a roommate!!Hi i am doing a pre med post bac and just graduated Cornell. I am starting to look for apartments and roommates but have zero idea how one might do that and find someone that I know will be a good fit. I'm super social but very much work hard play hard. I'm 22 female who loves working out, going out, and exploring philly! I don't know anybody there and would really rather have a roommate that is kind of in the same boat as me than live alone. Will take any tips!Questions about first semester mathIncoming freshman here. I was fortunate enough to go to an accelerated high school program, and I graduated with credit in multivariable calc and linear algebra. However, I took those classes a few semesters ago, and I'm worried that I might be a bit shaky on all of my math fundamentals.

I'm also a political science major, so a lot of math (outside of statistics) isn't really the primary focus of my field. With that in mind:

1. Should I try and review my old textbooks this summer so I can take a higher-level math course in the fall? Or would it be a better idea (especially for my GPA and stress level lolol) for me to just start off in an introductory calculus course?
2. What are the benefits of me starting off with an advanced math course for my first semester? Do I get credit for the courses that came before? Will it free up my schedule later on in my academic career? Does it open up any interesting opportunities?

Thanks a lot!I agree with this about MATH 241, and in fact it‚Äôs probably easier to get a good grade in the upper level classes. And it‚Äôs worth it with the retroactive credit available.Given your background, you probably should be able to learn the 5 weeks of differential equations they teach in 240/2400. If you do, I would encourage you to start with 241/2410 because it is simply a much better class than 104, 114, or 240. (Don't take it with Ching Li Chai though)I do not know much about your requirements for your major but I'm pretty sure you just need MATH 104 (or whatever they renamed it to). Statistics is probably your major focus, from my experience I hated the math course because of the stupid flipped and active learning. It wasn't until I took MATH 241 (now called MATH 2410) that I started to like it again.

I would say just focus on the math courses you need to take unless like taking math then take the course that you don't have credit for. If you want to take a higher math course, then double check, if you can get retroactive credit for another course if you pass (I know some courses don't offer that anymore). Other than that, you could also try to test out of them.For the political science major, there are no math requirements. You have the option to take stat classes if you‚Äôre interested in that side of things, where you‚Äôll learn how to code in R. However, I believe the intro calculus (formerly MATH 104) or multi-variable calculus (formerly MATH 114) count toward one of the general education requirements. That being said:

1. The math department‚Äôs course difficulty seems to vary a lot by instructor, so I‚Äôm unsure if a lower level course would necessarily be easier in the end. You‚Äôll likely be asked to take a math placement exam sometime this summer, which will let your advisor tell you your appropriate course level, so you could study for that if you would like, though it‚Äôs wholly unnecessary and won‚Äôt matter in the long run.

2. If you earn a high enough grade in MATH 114 (I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs new name)‚Äîabove a B+, I think (It‚Äôs on the math department‚Äôs website)‚Äîyou can ask for retroactive credit for the prior class MATH 104. This would help if you, say, wanted to minor in economics as many poli sci majors do as both courses are required for upper level econ coursesWhat kind of higher level math class did you have in mind? If you've already had multivarable and linear algebra, seems like not much else would be applicable to you. Maybe differential equations (240)?Given your background, you probably should be able to learn the 5 weeks of differential equations they teach in 240/2400. If you do, I would encourage you to start with 241/2410 because it is simply a much better class than 104, 114, or 240.

The feeling of being integrated into the city is honestly such a blessing for us. I‚Äôve spent a day almost every week exploring art, food, gaming, sports in Philly while some of my friends in secluded college towns haven‚Äôt had much of a reason to ever leave campus.

I need English as a pre-med requirement, and it would help immensely if I could just count a course I already took. Does anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to change a course name on a transcript if it‚Äôs the da me exact course as a cross listed one.This isn‚Äôt really an answer to your question, but you get to choose the course classification on the medical school application so if the class is clearly English based on the title you should be fine to classify it as thatYou cannot change it but you are not likely to get pushback from a med school if you share it is cross listed on your secondaries.Do you know how :( my advisor said no but I feel like I‚Äôve heard people say it‚Äôs possibleI think you can do thisDo you know how :( my advisor said no but I feel like I‚Äôve heard people say it‚Äôs possiblePost Bac Specialized Sciences Admit!Hi!!!

I wanted to know which meal plan is the best according to your experiences. I am planning on choosing the one with more dining dollars but I also have this feeling that I will not have enough money at the end of the semester. Thanks!More dining dollarsThe swipes give you access to the dining halls and meal exchange at Houston Market (which primarily uses Dining Dollars), but options are limited and you are probably NOT gonna use up all of it. I had a few friends in the first semester who got the more swipes version and ended up with like 200 swipes left. Not the best investment.

The more dining dollars plan, however, gives you more opportunity to go to places like Pret-A, Starbucks, Houston Market, and Gourmet Grocers (a mini-market). Granted, options aren't that much expanded, but the dollars provide better flexibility and give you room to manage your eating habits. You're likely to encounter a plethora amounts of free food events through clubs and events (especially if you know where to look), so you are probably not gonna worry about running out of swipes. Personally, I had like only 6 swipes left by the end of the semester, but that's because I eat pretty often and rely on McClelland. Some of my other friends had a decent 30-40 left.

Tl;dr: the one with more dining dollars gives you more flexibility and "more bang for your buck," but if we're being frank both plans suck.What is the difference between ‚Äúusing up all your dollars and have left over swipes‚Äù and ‚Äúusing up dollars quickly and have too many swipes.‚Äù
???I phrased it poorly, it's more about the time it takes to use up the dollars and only be stuck with swipes. So if it's 3 weeks to the end of the semester and all your dollars are gone, I think that's a better scenario to be in than only halfway through the semester and having only swipes (of which you will never use up because the more swipes plan is really impractical, idk anyone who got it and used all their swipes).It's better to at least use up all your dollars and have left over swipes than use up dollars quickly and have too many swipes.I chose the one with more dining dollars and ended up wasting about 50+ swipes so... :3I phrased it poorly, it's more about the time it takes to use up the dollars and only be stuck with swipes.

If you‚Äôre interested you should start one!

If you want to find other people interested in CP and practicing, there‚Äôs also PClassic, a club where a group of students organize a high school programming contest every semester at Penn and write programming problems together for novice and advanced highschoolers. It‚Äôs a really fun and chill club where everyone is passionate about CP and can share ideas every week. Feel free to ask me questions about it; I was part of it for 3.5/4 years at Penn.I'm a rising sophomore at Penn, and my friend and I are planning on competing at ICPC next year.

I think Shuttles you request a pick up and drop off location, and Buses run on a fixed routeGenerally the "shuttles" are either mini-buses or big vans.

Could i get suggestions of where the best rent/neighbourhood would be within a \~20-30min drive from campus? Looking for under $1000/month if possible.. Thanks for the help.Driving to campus will be a nightmare. I agree with the other poster that you should consider taking the regional rail to campus. In addition to East Falls, I'll also throw out Manayunk and Conshohocken as areas worth considering.I'm not sure what sure what type of housing for, but I'm a comparatively recent alumnus, and a homeowner in the West Philly area, and would be looking to fill a bedroom at the close of next month. I'm in the vicinity of 50th and Baltimore, and while there's decent parking should you want to navigate by vehicle, thing are also quite close to a trolley line that would deliver you directly onto campus, should you so prefer.

Let me know if the location/transit availability piques your interest. For the bedroom and a private bath, I'd certainly come in well within your price ceiling.

Drop me a line if the concept piques your interest.I live in East falls, it‚Äôs only a 20 minute train ride into the city and about a ten minute walk to campus. East falls has a lot of free street parking and the neighborhood is a lot cheaper than university city. I would recommend taking the train as parking at the school can be a bitch, and it‚Äôs more expensive than the train. You can find a few places in East falls for below $1,000 and it‚Äôs just a cool spot.Penn e-mail's password and Office 365Sorry if this has been answered.

I‚Äôm an incoming grad student and I‚Äôve been searching for housing for a couple months now but I‚Äôm still having a hard time finding a place that‚Äôs affordable, has okay amenities, is reasonable distance from campus, and is in a safe-ish area.

I applied to a place and got rejected with no explanation, and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm too late to find something before the fall starts. Does anyone have tips for how to find a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment in West Philly? I‚Äôve been looking mostly at leasing companies but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs better to go for places that aren‚Äôt owned by a company? I‚Äôve never done this before and would welcome any advice!Thank you so much, I really appreciate it! Do you happen to know if Zillow and Hotpads are generally better websites than Apartments.com for finding apartments? Totally fine if not, just wanted to ask!I'm not sure which is better. Zillow is nice for setting alerts and includes apartments beyond the large buildings. 

Philly has many rowhomes that have been broken up into apartments.Welcome! The rental market is pretty tight in Philly right now. Check out websites like Zillow and Hotpads. You can set alerts from Zillow to your phone when a place comes up for rent that fits your criteria. Also, consider looking in other neighborhoods popular with grad students such as Fitler Square and Grad Hospital. A short bus ride will also get you from the other side of the city to campus so also consider neighborhoods like Washington Square West.Hi! I‚Äôm hoping for a place that‚Äôs <$1550/month, hopefully in the 700+ sq.ft. range, and within 3.5 miles from the Penn campus. Washer/dryer in-unit and hardwood floors (or at least non-carpet because of asthma issues) would be a plus! Feel free to let me know if your place might be a good fit!That sounds exactly like my place. I'll DM you with photos.I have a one bedroom house that I'm renting near Clark Park. What are you looking for exactly?Ooh okay, thank you for the tip, I wasn‚Äôt sure if people had made one for UPenn, but I‚Äôll look into the facebook housing groups too!There are definitely Penn-centered ones but I think they're mostly undergrad. All groups are worth looking into though bc there are some specific West Philly ones too. Again sorry I don't know specific links.It‚Äôs all good, thank you for the suggestions and pointing me in a good direction!Im not on them myself but apparently Facebook groups/marketplace are where it's at. Maybe some other people here can chime in on good ones but check for "Philly housing" etc etc on keywordsOoh okay, I hadn‚Äôt thought of that but it‚Äôs good to know having a real estate agent helps, I will look into it :)I contacted a real estate agent that's been super helpful!Ahh, it‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not alone in this! And congrats on being an incoming grad student! Thank you for the advice, and since a few people have seconded Zillow, I‚Äôm definitely going to be looking for places on there! Also potentially looking into a real estate agent :)I am also an incoming graduate student (frantically searching for an August move in lol) and I have found that Zillow is good for alerts and getting an idea of different rental agencies in the area. Hotpads is a nice tool but I found Zillow more convenient, finding a real estate agent would probably work well too since they might have connections with smaller landlords. Worst case scenario is you go in person and look for ‚Äúfor rent‚Äù signs in the area, I‚Äôve heard you can get some good deals as it is usually a small landlord who doesn‚Äôt know how (or want) to post their rental online.

CHAS has RA positions available for the summer but I believe most of them are for returning RAs, since you would not have done the training otherwise. There are also Summer Community Advisor positions for students that are in highschool summer programmes for example. Otherwise there are a lot of other positions too. At this point I'd just get in touch with them and ask if they have anything available.Thank you so much for your advice. They are so helpful :) I tried to look up for these positions @penncareer, but I can‚Äôt find them. Is there a specific place we can find for summer jobs only?As I said, most of them are filled at this point. Your best shot is just emailing CHAS and asking if they have anything last minute (this is is especially good because they also give housing) and see what they reply.

I am currently pre-med (prospective MD-PhD) interested in drug discovery and protein design, but I feel that I lack the quantitative and computational skills necessary to succeed in this research area (or if I decide that pre-med is not for me). 

Can anyone comment on the biophysics major in regard to these three things? Thanks!

1) its classes and rigor

2) the kind of research it sets you up for

3) any computational background that the major providesidk about Biophysics in specific but the Dept of Physics offers 3 "computational courses":  Intro to Data Analysis, Intro to Machine Learning and Math Methods (which is basically Graduate-level Applied Math)Any good studio 1/bd leads?Incoming grad student, budget is max $1,200Hotpads and Zillow.

If you're looking at a 5 year PhD, well it's also great to start in Sansom your first year then expand outwards when you know which areas you like. Some people prefer living in Center City and commuting via Septa twice a day. Some PhDs are mostly virtual and only commute in once a week. I preferred living right next to my lab since experiments would run all day, I don't have to be around but they do require frequent check-ins. To each their own tbh!Check here, you have to sign in and the map/options off campus are pretty good: [https://offcampushousing.upenn.edu/](https://offcampushousing.upenn.edu/)

Also at that budget, on-campus housing is a pretty good option as well. Sansom has great location/proximity to classes and nice views from the top. There are communal kitchen options so even though it's not listed, you should still be able to get access to one. I enjoyed my time there but there isn't too much of a community aspect (unless you're an international student, they seem to have better cliques based on language spoken)Ideally within a 20-25 min walk of campus in any direction.Do you have a specific place/neighborhood in mind?Thanks for the heads upIf you're only around for 1-2 years masters it's good enough.

If not what are my options?You can talk to fin aid and see if they can help you out with thatAll federal and most private student loans are only going to lend to you if you‚Äôre enrolled at least part time. You could explore personal loans, but the rates on those are not going to be nearly as friendly as the ones designed for students taking classes. They also don‚Äôt have the same kind of protections. Unless you have a way to pay those funds back very quickly, I‚Äôd be nervous about personal loan debt compounding and getting out of hand.Acct 101(0)Would it be wise to take this class in a semester where I'm taking two other fairly difficult classes already? How difficult and how much work would it be to do well in this class?Thanks a lot for the insight!Didn‚Äôt think it was too bad, the class builds on itself so if you get the basics down early, the rest isn‚Äôt too difficult. The class has no hw so I usually studied a few days before each exam and was fine. All exams are also open-note which is probably how I was able to get away with this lol. I took it with cis160 and did p wellThanks a lot for the insight!Orgo 2Does anyone have any tips for orgo 2 and how to prepare for it? What knowledge should I brush up on from orgo 1? Thanks!For orgo 2, I highly recommend not straying behind. There is generally a lot more things (reactions, mechanisms, etc) covered, so it feels like the class moves faster than in orgo 1 (at least that was how I personally felt). Keep up with the course and you should be fine! As the professors always suggest, practice is pretty key in orgo in general. 

As for knowledge from orgo 1, the basics that you have established there still apply, such as arrow-pushing mechanisms and nucleophile/electrophile stuff. If you read the textbook closely, you should be fine as the later chapters tend to review useful material from previous chapters.Penn! Register to VoteHere's how to register to vote in Pennsylvania. These instructions work nationally so they can be shared with out of state friends or family and use non-partisan information.

Please share the info with anyone who might want to register, but hasn't had the chance, time, or info to do so yet.

**Basically: Find your state **[**here**](https://vote.gov/)** and use your state's online voter registration tool to register.** If your state is one of ten that does not currently allow online registration, this website will tell you and will tell you how to complete your registration - it's usually printing/filling out a form and mailing it in.

OR, you can [register to vote in person](https://www.usa.gov/election-office).

**FAQ:**

**Q: Am I already registered to vote? Am I eligible to vote? Do I need an ID to vote? When is my next election?**

Answers [here.](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/sviddomestic.htm)

**Q: If I'm 17, can I register to vote today?**

Yes, in a number of states! If you proceed through to your state's online voting portal, which can be found [here](https://vote.gov/), it'll tell you whether you're good to go.

**Q: I'll be moving to college soon. Where should I register to vote?**

Either place - your choice. If you register to vote at school, you'll need to register or re-register with the state your school's in. If you decide to keep your home address as your voting address, you can head home to vote or vote by absentee ballot (info below on how to request & return one).

**Q: What if I need to change my voter registration?**

Find your state [here](https://vote.gov/) and follow the instructions. If you have any further questions call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm).

**Q: Can I register to vote on election day?**

If your state is purple on [this map](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx), yes. So, your friend who forgot to register can still come with you and get it done.

**Q: What if my state doesn't have same-day registration?**

Then your state likely has a registration deadline of about 30 days. That means it has to be **in their hands** by 30 days before election day.

If you're not registering online, I'd walk it to their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them, or mail it if you're doing it very early so you can be sure it arrived.

But don't depend on the mail within ...6 weeks before an election. It's just too dicey.

**Q: Do I need to keep that voter registration card they'll mail me?**

It's useful for your reference & knowing your polling place, but it is not *required* for voting. 

**Q: Can I use a pen with pink/green/orange etc. ink on these forms/on my ballot?**

It's the kind of thing you don't think of, until you do. They only allow the most conservative of colors and inks, so keep it simple: blue or black ball point pen.

If you're entering most of the info on the computer and then printing it out, your printer's default black ink is also fine.

**Q: Can I get an absentee ballot?**

*Make sure you're registered to vote first.* Then, [this page](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/VoterInformation.htm) will tell you your state's requirements, and how to request an absentee ballot.

If you vote absentee, unless you're mailing it in *very early* (over six weeks before the election), drop it off at their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them so you can be sure it arrived.

You can do that any day before the election.

**Q: If I have a felony on my record, can I vote?**

Check [here](https://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote)! Often, yes.

**Q: I'm forgetful. Is there a way I can be sent reminders?**

Yes! [Here](https://iamavoter.com).

**Q: But, do the midterms matter in my state? My state's firmly Dem/Rep.**

They sure do. While your state may not be competitive in a presidential election, your *district* may be competitive for the House of Representatives and your Senator may be. Plus, governor, state reps, etc. 

There are purple spots in blue and red states - you may be in one, and your vote could swing a number of outcomes.

**Q: Where's competitive this year?**

There are particularly competitive races in more than half the states - either [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings), [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings), or [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings). 

The list: New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Texas, Virginia, Washington, California, Colorado, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Jersey, Maryland, Indiana, and Rhode Island.

If you live in any of these states, there's a lot of competition for your vote this year and it's a great chance to get your voice heard.

**Q: If my state isn't on the list, there's no point in voting, right?**

Incorrect! Local races are hugely important. Some examples: county prosecutors can, for instance, choose whether to prosecute non-violent drug crimes or sex work that is occurring without trafficking. 

They also recommend sentencing. Some are very strict, while some others choose to make those issues their lowest policy priority. 

State legislatures and governors decide, for instance, what happens with guns, lgbtq+ rights, and school funding in your state. 

State Attorneys General can defend state abortion laws or choose not to. 

Secretaries of State can help people register to vote or make it harder for them, within the already existing laws.

**tl;dr - register to vote. for a lot of reasons. if you read the news, or reddit, i'm sure you can easily come up with some.**

if you have questions about registering in your particular state, comment and i'll do my best to help. i did election stuff as a job for a few years, and i know how complicated finding the information you need can be. that's why i'm making these guides now.Let's go Republicans!!!!Biochem/ organic chemDo you need organic chem knowledge for biochemistry?Orgo 1 definitely helps.. if you're taking CHEM251, I know we had to draw a few arrow-pushing mechanisms.

Thanks!Yes, if you can get a spot.What math class should I take next fall?I'm an LPS post bacc student, meaning I've already graduated from an undergrad institution but will be taking a class or two at UPenn before grad school. The last math course I took in undergrad was Multivariable Calculus. What UPenn course would be a sensible follow up, specifically for someone who wants to pursue a grad degree in the quantitative social sciences? I've been mainly considering Linear Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations and Linear Algebra, but any other suggestions are also welcomed.How are your stat skills? Quant social sciences tend to rely heavily on those.i‚Äôm a post-bacc student too so üëã.  

check the admission requirements for your graduate programs and take the core math courses required for those. that is, unless you want to take math courses for fun!

there are basically two flavors of math courses (computational and theoretical). so far sounds like you taken purely computational classes, so if you wanna take a course like advanced linear algebra then heads up that‚Äôs a theoretical proofs course. 

advanced linear algebra is proof heavy so a course like intro to proofs via analysis or intro to proofs via abstract algebra (i don‚Äôt remember the exact course titles / numbers) would probably be a solid pre-req for that if you never written a proof before. 

in a theoretical linear algebra you wouldn‚Äôt be computing a lot of things but rather proving things. 

these proof based courses may not be helpful in quantitative social sciences ‚Äî the more computational based courses might be more of a benefit for you, such as a course in applied stats or something. check the admissions requirements and engage from there, unless you really wanna take pure math courses for funProbably MATH 2400 (very basic lin algebra and ODE) or 2410 (diff equations)

MATH 3120 (not sure, but should also be doable and useful)

MATH 3140 (advanced linear algebra). Have taken this, but really it is very challenging and may not be directly useful for social sciences studies... It is purely theoretical and proof-based, and is more designed for people pursuing a Master/PhD degree in math-related fields.

If you have to choose one, I'd say linear algebra is an essential tool for all sciences. Maybe 3120?cis 262 and cis 511is it redundant to take both? is one a better class than the other?(I took both of these at least two years ago and this is all from memory).

Pretty redundant to take both. My iteration of 511 covered a couple of topics that weren't mentioned in my iteration of 262 (e.g., the polynomial hierarchy, some randomized algorithms), but it doesn't seem like it's worth taking 262 to "prepare" for 511. If you're especially mathematically inclined or think the content sounds interesting (which seems to be the case) taking 511 sounds reasonable.What UPenn-esque plushie should I get my best friend?Hi all! Hope you don‚Äôt mind me asking a little question. My best friend is going to UPenn, and I‚Äôd like to get a gift for her to take. She got me a super clever stuffed animal that relates to my college‚Äôs mascot, so I‚Äôd like to do the same for her. The thing is, there aren‚Äôt any Quaker plushies out there. Are there any iconic UPenn inside jokes I could play off of, or should I go basic and get her a red and blue plushie?

It‚Äôs 400 USDQuestion to all International StudentsHow do you get an SSN and what are some horror stories of yours regarding SSN, and cultural shock in USA. I have heard that there have been students that had started job and didn‚Äôt have a Social Security Number, and when it came to get the wage, they didn‚Äôt- story from another Ivy league institution. 
Also I would be rrally grateful if you gave some advice on what we should be cautious when coming to Penn and USA. Thank you all very much in Advance.What about campus jobs? Do you need an SSN for that?Yes, I‚Äôm pretty sure you need one/will be eligible for one if you get the job. Again talk to an advisor.

In that case you‚Äôll have to get a job offer, and apply for an SSN cuz you‚Äôll be eligible to apply for one. Alternatively, you could get a letter from USCIS that you‚Äôre unable to get an SSN which you would then hand over to your employer (aka Penn) and they would hire you without an SSN.

I haven‚Äôt done that so this is based on things I‚Äôve read ages ago. Double check with ISSS, you not only can just walk in but you also have a DEDICATED advisor that helps you in these situations.

I don‚Äôt want to be rude but Reddit shouldn‚Äôt be your first point of contact for stuff like this.Thank youu very much!! You are right, but I just kinda wanted to know something before heading to my advisors, so that I am not totally clueless about thingsYou get an SSN when you apply for work authorization in the US. Depending on your visa, you may or may not quality for work, work-study, OPT, CPT etc and so it completely depends on your situation. TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR AT ISSS FIRST. They should be your first point of contact at all times.

But for both CPT and OPT it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. I can speak for the latter:

1- You apply for OPT through ISSS at Penn (usually Spring of Senior year)
If approved:

2- You apply for an EAD card *AND* your SSN‚Äî if you don‚Äôt already have one‚Äîat the same time.

3-wait for your EAD card which gives you the right to work in the US in a field related to your major (e.g public policy if you‚Äôre, say, a poli sci major)

4- Wait for your SSN which is usually sent around the same time maybe a few days after you get your EAD.

5- hopefully during all of this you were applying for jobs because you now have the right to work anywhere in the US! Enjoy! The limit is 1 year for non-STEM and I think 2 years for STEM majors.

‚Äî

I believe there are other ways to get an SSN. But for the most part you get one when you get a job. I have a friend who did CPT so he got his SSN junior year over the summer. Not a labor expert so idk if what his company did was legal but my friend couldn‚Äôt get his pay til he got his SSN. So if you can, get it BEFORE your first day at the job.

Basically, if you follow policy and the recommendations the ISSS gives you‚Äôll avoid any of the horror stories. The only thing that might happen is waiting a long time for your EAD or SSN which can happen. So apply the first day you can for OPT or CPT whichever one you want.

I got mine in 2 months.Yes, I‚Äôm pretty sure you need one/will be eligible for one if you get the job. Again talk to an advisor.

i took ap micro & macro in sophomore year of HS and got 5s so i could use an econ 0100 and 0200 waiver. (001&002)

i‚Äôm a prospective econ major in CAS (may change)‚Äî does anyone who had a similar path recommend that i take introductory econ courses again? or would i be fine using the waivers and taking a higher level course?

i‚Äôm concerned bc i took econ so long ago & wonder if i need to relearn. has anyone experienced this & what do u recommend? would studying over the summer even help? tysmREALLY are they too difficult? is it better to waive them üò≠I liked 001. 002 was just taught bad. 101 is the one that's actually fucking hard.No do not take Econ 001 and 002 they are living hell </3sorry what‚Äôs 0xxx? is that like in between 001/002 & advanced? thank you!!the intro courses that arent 001 or 002 so like the ones people who aren't in the econ major take like econ 0120, 0390, etc. they usually have similar names to an advanced course but are meant for ppl filling gen eds or the econ policy minorsuper helpful, thanks!!i waived econ 002 and took a 0xxx-level ECON course prior to declaring the major and if u have 2 waivers, u can do one 0xxx-level Econ course and 1 advanced level one or 2 advanced level ones. tbh u don't need the intro series for the intermediate courses but i thought econ-001 was a good intro into econ and if ur gonna take econ 001 or econ 002, econ 001 is easier.appreciate it!! thank you so muchI was in your shoes a year ago and chose to use my waivers and start with econ 101 in the spring (took 114 in the fall). I‚Äôd recommend you and others do the same. Granted, 101 with mailath was actual hell on earth and the most humbling class I‚Äôve ever taken. But I really don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve gained anything from retaking macro and micro. As long as you 1. are comfortable with optimization / math and numbers in general and 2. have a basic grasp of concepts like consumer surplus, utility, and profit maximizing behavior, you‚Äôll be fine.I liked 001. 002 was just taught bad. 101 is the one that's actually fucking hard.REALLY are they too difficult? is it better to waive them üò≠the intro courses that arent 001 or 002 so like the ones people who aren't in the econ major take like econ 0120, 0390, etc. they usually have similar names to an advanced course but are meant for ppl filling gen eds or the econ policy minorsuper helpful, thanks!!sorry what‚Äôs 0xxx? is that like in between 001/002 & advanced? thank you!!appreciate it!! thank you so muchI liked 001. 002 was just taught bad. 101 is the one that's actually fucking hard.super helpful, thanks!!the intro courses that arent 001 or 002 so like the ones people who aren't in the econ major take like econ 0120, 0390, etc. they usually have similar names to an advanced course but are meant for ppl filling gen eds or the econ policy minorsuper helpful, thanks!!Any Facebook groups to buy/sell furniture?I'm an incoming grad student, and I'm looking for a group where I can find used furniture, preferably in University City.There is a Philadelphia Marketplace on FB but I would also recommend joining BuyNothing group.

When do 8/1 rentals typically open up?I have been looking and all my favorites are taken within a day. its so exhausting doing an hour commute (even with applying right as its listed) to tour and then later that day or next day being told it went to someone else. Im checking every day and nothing good gets posted. Ughhhhh sorry just had to ventYou‚Äôre fine! I literally started looking in March and just found a place like two weeks ago. I heard that people are apparently signing leases and putting down deposits without even physically seeing a place. It‚Äôs that bad. You can try Facebook groups for people looking for roommates. A lot of people are looking to replace their roommates that graduated!

edit: to answer your last question, I saw a lot of places that were open for September awhile ago. I think there‚Äôs no set time it‚Äôs just whenever a landlord or leasing company feels like it lol. Again, I‚Äôd start looking now. Also noticed you are looking for a 1bd. I‚Äôd still try fb since people are looking to sublease as they graduated. you can sometimes find a place where you can renew the lease after the sublease.Try calling one of the big landlords like Campus Apartments with a list of your requirements and ask what units they have. Did that once and they were able to show me multiple places in the same day.As soon as possible honestly. Took me ~3 months to find my place and I only found a place that was available after my intended move in date. Summer/fall semester are high peak timesLook for apartments for (amount of days until you move in)/e days as benchmark period. After that, take the next apartment that's better than all the ones you've seen in the benchmark period.Typically 4-6 weeks in advance.I‚Äôm seeing August rentals popping up a little bit more now (I‚Äôm also looking to move in August) and when I called a rental agency they said most August move-ins won‚Äôt be posted until about June 5th so keep checking.

I want a close-knit community, but one that is not so frat/party-centered if that makes sense. I also want an all-freshman house. I am double majoring in Econ/CS if that matters. 

I am deciding between Hill and KCEH (maybe a house in quad if someone makes a compelling case for it). Which one should I choose?Makes sense, thanks. I will rank Hill first then. Still don‚Äôt know if I should rank KCEH or some quad house second. Others say that KCEH can be isolating. I will make sure to sign up for a pre-orientation program.KCECH can be isolating if you're not in Huntsman.

I have not received my financial aid package yet, however my parents make less than $100,000 so I am optimistic that i‚Äôll get good aid. I was thinking about enrolling by May 31 which is the deadline to be considered in the first round of housing. I was thinking of doing this since I really wanted a suite, I don‚Äôt think I can do traditional dorms. Is this a good idea?Can first years not live in De Bois?Oh sorry! Yes you can dorm in Du Bois but I forgot to include itThank you!! Is it likely I‚Äôll be able to get into one of these suite styles if I wait until after the priority deadline?Also are you aware of how much the enrollment and housing deposit are?Yes you probably will find a spot in Du Bois or Gregory. Lauder? Probably not! 
Also, if you don‚Äôt know, Du Bois is known to be a safe community for black people so you might not fit in. 

The enrollment deposit is $400, and you might get it waived depending on your financial situation. There‚Äôs no housing deposit as far as I know. It‚Äôs included in the total bill.Lauder was my first pick after doing research, it does seem popular. I am black so Du Bois will be a good choice as well! Thanks for all the helpLauder is very hard, especially if you can‚Äôt apply to a Program Community üòÖ 
Yeah Du Bois is honestly great! A real sense of community, suites‚Ä¶ looks cool nglCongrats on getting off the waitlist! 

Freshmen can live in 2 houses that offer suites, Gregory and Lauder. The latter is much, much more harder to get into compared to the former. I suggest you do some additional research on both of these houses and rank them as 1/2. Rank the rest as your top 3-6. If you have any other questions, I'm happy to assist.Oh sorry!

For example, could someone get dean's list if they had a 4.0 fall semester and a 3.6 spring semester, but their academic year GPA comes out \~3.8ish. Thanks :)CumIt's just given for that academic year and it is as an avg between the fall and spring. So yeah, that situation you listed would get dean's list. (so long as you fulfill the other points here: [https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/deans-list/](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/deans-list/))penn doesnt do deans list anymorepls suggest cheap restaurants for dinner w friends, under $15You can get massive ramen bowls from Ramen Bar (near drexel) for like 12$ pre taxPasqually's is my secret weird spot hahaSaad on 45th and walnut, wishbone on 41 and walnut, hoagies from Pasqually‚Äôs

Penang is great too 

Ba LeI feel like you can get takeout meals from most chinese restaurants for under $15 (like a fried rice or smth). But if you're looking to have a proper meal in like a dine-in restaurant, the only one that comes to my mind is ShiMiaoDao Yunnan Rice Noodle in chinatown (usually $15-20 plus tax and tips for me). I'm sure there's many other restaurants that fit what ur looking for so plz excuse my very limited knowledge on this :3.mcdonald‚ÄôsAllegros Baked Ziti, talk to DanEd's Buffalo Wings and Pizzas is pretty good.

Yes, there‚Äôs a few kids that are cutthroat in the sense they don‚Äôt want to help you, but the vast majority would be willing to help. It just feels competitive at times because most people don‚Äôt mess around with their classes.That‚Äôs the type of kid they look to admit.My experience going to a top 50 school and then to Penn as a grad student. What stuck out to me is that everyone gave 100% on every. single. assignment. There was no chill but it didn‚Äôt feel competitive in my program.

Penn kids could use more chill.Depends. But sort of yeah. Could be a just a general college experience though.

But comparing my experience to friends in other schools, the student experience at Penn *does* tend to be a bit more competitive and cutthroat.

It also highly depends on the peers you surround yourself with. Needless to say that political science leaning folk tend to be pretty ducking competitive.It really depends on your post-graduate goal. Are you trying to get into investment banking or consulting? Then yes, it‚Äôs extremely competitive and sometimes even toxic. Do you want to do literally anything else? Well it sucks if you said yes cause Penn will almost certainly convert you to a sellout.

In all seriousness, I love Penn and I‚Äôm really happy here. I‚Äôm in mechanical engineering, and although it feels like I am one of the few engineers that is actually going into engineering instead of a financial sellout job, I feel like I really do have a place here. My main piece of advice is keep your wits about you and if you have dreams about some cool career you want after you graduate, hold onto those dreams and don‚Äôt let the culture at Penn convince you out of them. All of your friends will be grinding for those summer internships at McKinsey but you just need to stay level headed and think about where you actually want to end up!In my experience, kinda mostly yesThisonly if you surround yourself with those kinds of peoplehttps://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/ul4s7q/is_it_really_that_bad/YesNot the LSM, M&T, and Huntsman admits. Sometimes VIPER too.What does this even mean?no! we are all harvard, yale, stanford rejects after all. just happy to be here ‚ù§Ô∏è3000% to be frank? You do not have to apply to a single club if you don't want to.  Internships and research positions and jobs are things that people aspire to get.  Trying to get them is stressful for anyone.   It is not necessary to be get fancy internships etc.. at Penn or at Yale, but it is definitely a good thing and students at Penn know this and have advisers that can put this in perspective.  If you want a certain type of position at a certain type of company and that is what does it for you, yeah you will be in a hopefully organized rational effort to get a summer job.  Perhaps if you are at Yale, and get into it (congrats) you may feel a little less pressure at school. The OP might want to learn more about what specific majors and programs may lead to more competitiveness and stress.  It is very program specific and the tolerance to a program depends on your personality.  Maybe Penn is more competitive in some ways than Yale. That does not help the OP unless Yale is one of his choices.Wasn‚Äôt OP asking if Penn was competitive or cutthroat? I feel as though it‚Äôs a bit of a yes/no question don‚Äôt you think? I based my response off my ex‚Äôs experience, and simply pointed out aspects of his experience I thought were more competitive/cutthroat than other universities including Yale. And I definitely think it‚Äôs useful advice regardless of OP‚Äôs admission status at Yale, as I believe highlighting the points where upenn is unusually competitive, like clubs, would be valuable to OP. And to address the point you made in your post, while at Yale and every other school there are certainly going to be people that are very pre-professional and rush for first year internships and clubs, but from what my ex has told me, there seems to be an abnormally large amount of them at Penn. While this may be different from when you were on campus, I‚Äôve been told that there is a very clear hierarchy of clubs, with those at the top tier requiring numerous case and personal interviews to even be considered. And the fact that there‚Äôs even clubs considered ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù should be a sign of the competitiveness of the schoolBitch 
You don‚Äôt even go here, stop arguing. And don‚Äôt you think ‚Äúdated‚Äù is a bit of a stretch? Especially given that you were fucking three states awayHi, your views are supported by your experience and thought out so I hope you don't mind a friendly debate -- I just don't agree with you and am a defender of Penn, at least in terms of some of the stereotypes you mention.  I also sometimes feel that students choosing among schools should delve into the realty of their specific situation and chosen path of study.   I could give you some legitimate flaws of UPenn and I don't have a problem listing some of them.  1) they need to hire more CS teachers 2) they need to greatly improve CAPS for better support of student's emotional and psychological needs 3) they should be supportive of a more politically diverse student body so that their is more discourse among people with different political opinions (libertarians, conservatives, liberals, moderates) and allow disagreeable but legitimate thinkers and politicians to speak their views.  I could go on with flaws but competitive and cutthroat are not among Penn's major flaws and if they exist they are not unique to Penn. The Club game is real but it is also at the end of the day a who freaking cares thing. Like many things in life (frat entry, student government) it is partly a popularity contest. Most freshman seek out a few clubs and get turned away to some or all, then keep applying and by their sophomore year they have a club or two that they feel they like or they may not even join one. Life goes on and you may spend your time on more meaningful things like service, research, a work study job, study abroad. Half the people who join clubs quit them if they don't become an officer or president and jump clubs until they are in the upper sphere of that club. Its a game and it is meaningful for those who successfully game it. I think employers do not give a crud about it and are more impressed with other activities. My experience is both past and present. I have a child at Penn now.  That person did not get into all the clubs he or she applied to, found one or two he or she did like and has stuck with two that he or she loves, but it took a couple of years to sort out. OK, now on to this pre-professional dig that some consider a flaw.  This is nonsense. You have three pre-professional schools where perhaps 1/2 to 2/3 of the students reside. By definition they are pre-professional.  Then you have pre-law and pre-med (which you have at every Ivy school in large numbers).  In college most people do want to explore a career or at least figure out a path to a first job or a direction as to a field for a vocation.  It is true everywhere.  Students even at Harvard, Yale and MIT do not go to college to merely engage in philosophical thought about life, they are more often practical about having a useful role in society and getting a job. CAS at UPenn is about the size of Yale and it is essentially a liberal arts college with the freedom to take courses at any of the 3 other schools.  You have the best of all worlds IMO at Penn. It is pre-professional and pre-anything. You do what interests you. I understand that reasonable minds may differ.Yalie here, but I dated a penn kid for nine months so I think I can speak here. I can attest to how competitively he viewed the entire experience. He was on a mad dash to get an internship halfway through summer and the fact that you all need to APPLY TO CLUBS is absolutely ridiculous. 3000% more competitive than Yale to be frank.Eh. People stress and exaggerate it. It depends what your program is and who your friends are. All of my friends were more than happy to help me study, and we supported each other.

I disagree with the characterisation that everyone gives 100% on every assignment, at least in undergrad. People certainly care ‚Äî and some of them care *a lot* ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre all that competitive/cutthroat. Feel free to DM if you want specific examples or whatever.

Edit: Some professors grade with a bitch curve, though, making some intro courses hella brutal.Competitive and cutthroat are two different ideas to me.  Most students at Penn want to do well and will work hard.  This in and of itself leads to a competitive environment and most students who are admitted to Penn are used to excelling in HS gradewise and accordingly want this "success" in College.  With nearly 10 thousand undergraduate students, you are going to have all types of personalities at Penn and you will have the same personalities by and large at other Ivy and so called top tier colleges.  Cutthroat -- no. Will you have your occasional back-stabbers and cheaters -- YES. You have that at any school and it is part of life, unfortunately, but is not novel to Penn.Not really unless you're premed or prelawthat is a big number.  as painful as this question is... dm me and give me that year.  I don't agree with your assessment, but I would very much like to know the specifics.  i found Penn to be challenging academically but I had GREAT professors.  What you describe is foreign to me, my child that goes there now and my friends.  I do not doubt your experience.This is a lieYes. When I was there we had a dozen student suicides in one academic year. Penn will chew you up and spit you out if you aren‚Äôt careful.yes.NoAs a premed, cutthroat is the last word I would use to describe Penn.The fuck kind of classes you takingThis past semester, a generic finance, physics, history, and econ class. Barely 25% at best of the kids at the first class/test were actually in class by the endIn my experience in most classes, barely at all.

My amazing wife has applied for UPenn's online masters program in animal welfare and behavior. She's a busy working professional at an animal shelter. She is a behaviorist and has a bachelor's degree in psychology.

She has been wondering what practical benefits there are to this program. Will she be able to obtain a higher paying position with it? Will her knowledge of animal behavior improve to the point where it will greatly separate her performance from her peers?

The cost of the program is pretty significant, and she was wondering about the cost benefit ratio. There isn't much posted online about people's personal experience, at least as far as Google searches go.

Anyone who has completed this program with any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you, and I hope everything is awesome for you!Thank you! That's a great suggestion to try and contact alumni. I'll encourage her to do so.So I don't have experience with this program or with Penn Vet's online offerings, but I'll bite since there are no other responses. I recently completed a certificate program through Penn LPS Online; it looks like the structure was pretty much the same as well as the cost (although I did it for free being a Penn staff member) ‚Äì it was 4 courses over the span of an academic year, one synchronous session per week and a couple of hours worth of recorded videos, one homework/problem set due per week.

What I will say is that I had a very positive experience and picked up a very marketable tech-related skill. The instructors were extremely approachable and we ended up forming a pretty tight-knit cohort. However, I don't find that it has really given me much of a boost in my job search efforts ‚Äì I think people see "certificate" and immediately think of Coursera or edX or the like, and the rigor of these programs is not widely recognized even at Penn. If I had the choice to make over again but had to pay full price, I don't think I'd do it because I'm just not sure the cost-benefit ratio would tip in the right direction.

However, again, I don't have experience with this specific program or with the veterinary field, which may place a higher value on certificates. Plus the UPenn name never hurts, as long as you can emphasize that this was a full-fledged program taught by real professors and not a self-paced Coursera module that you rushed through in two weeks.

As a footnote I'd say maybe encourage your wife to write into Penn Vet to see if they'd be willing to connect her with some program alumni.Really old webinar/info session recording for this program 
https://vimeo.com/416027820Thank you for taking the time to answer! I work in trades, so my understanding of the benefits of graduate education is somewhat lacking.Grad school can be a bit mysterious for those who don't know anyone who experienced it.

Think of it as training in big picture thinking and detail-oriented thinking skills.

The isn't a clear cost/benefit besides gaining social and professional connections. She would be working with amazing experts (both professors and other students); will have nuanced discussions about complicated and controversial topics.

The main skills taught in grad school is critical thinking and communicating complex ideas.
In other words, she'll be better able to apply theoretical/experimental research to solve practical problems or improve current procedures.

Bachelors: broad, not too deep. Kind of like a sampler of various fields and different parts of a field.
Masters: more specialized and deeper. Learn how the field approaches problems, how to evaluate what is known, and make informed opinions/decisions.


If she wants to pivot/switch/shift careers, she'll learn how to be a badass quicker.
If she already has a career, she'll get a multiplier to her current level of badassery.

This, of course, depends partially on luck, personal situation, imagination, location, and demand in certain industries.
Again, there are a lot of homeless Phds.
Hell, there are MDs that learned that they hate the healthcare industry - so they quit being a doctor and find happiness touring with a band.
Or tech companies hiring philosophy majors (because they can actually write coherently, unlike me)  https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/16/tech-talent-gap-looks-to-philosophy-majors-ceo-mike-gregoire-says.htmlThis is grad school, not professional school. 
Unlike MD, JD, MBA, MPA, MPH, etc., there isn't a set (or obvious) career path. 
You might make more money or you might not make more money.
Just like a bachelor's degree in psychology, it's kind of like a choose your own adventure.

There is a vast number of career trajectories/career goals represented in the current students.

If your wife doesn't know what they want to do with this credential, then they shouldn't be applying (unless the goal is simply for the fun of learning). 

The program is equally difficult and fun/eye-opening. Grad school is a unique experience. 
If she does this program, she will definitely grow as a person and become better prepared to face bigger personal and professional challenges. 
You will have increased responsibility to go above and beyond to support her through the roughest of times. 
This will be advanced husband-ing.

The Cert and MSc program at PennVet has only been around for a few years, so there aren't many alumni.

A lot of veterinarians are enrolled in the master's degree so they can qualify for a diplomate / board exam in Animal Welfare.

The certificate is equivalent to the first year of the masters program (which is 2 to 2.5 ish years).Thank you! That's a great suggestion to try and contact alumni. I'll encourage her to do so.Really old webinar/info session recording for this program

Think of it as training in big picture thinking and detail-oriented thinking skills.

The isn't a clear cost/benefit besides gaining social and professional connections. She would be working with amazing experts (both professors and other students); will have nuanced discussions about complicated and controversial topics.

The main skills taught in grad school is critical thinking and communicating complex ideas.
In other words, she'll be better able to apply theoretical/experimental research to solve practical problems or improve current procedures.

Bachelors: broad, not too deep. Kind of like a sampler of various fields and different parts of a field.
Masters: more specialized and deeper. Learn how the field approaches problems, how to evaluate what is known, and make informed opinions/decisions.


If she wants to pivot/switch/shift careers, she'll learn how to be a badass quicker.
If she already has a career, she'll get a multiplier to her current level of badassery.

This, of course, depends partially on luck, personal situation, imagination, location, and demand in certain industries.
Again, there are a lot of homeless Phds.
Hell, there are MDs that learned that they hate the healthcare industry - so they quit being a doctor and find happiness touring with a band.

I have international student friends with it (I also have it). Would be happy to send a referral link üôÇ

Also, I‚Äôd kindly suggest against the Apple Card. If it weren‚Äôt for the fact that Apple white labels that card, it would not be nearly as popular. 2% on everything is basically the standard for a decent card (Amex Gold is 2 points on everything, each point about 2 or 2.1 cents). Also, they won‚Äôt let you share the data with financial apps like Mint, etc. You also cannot beat Amex customer service. Who wants to support Goldman Sachs more, anyways?Indeed, it‚Äôs $250 a year. However, you get $10/month credits to both Uber and Grubhub. If you‚Äôre already using those services, effective annual fee is $10.There's a good counterpoint from /u/dabelong in the thread I linked:

> It's not fair to value the food credits fully at $240 because:

>1. You have to use each $10 monthly. Use it or lose it

>2. Would you have specifically used the services from the credits (Uber/UberEATS or GrubHub/Seamless/Shake Shack/other)?

>3. Even if you would have spent on the places specifically, you could've spent the $240 naturally with a credit card and have gotten X rewards. i.e. if I spent the $240 directly at the restaurant with Amex Plat (Resy offer), I would have gotten 15X MRs (3600. At least $36 value at 1cpp, arguably more)

>4. Imagine that it is a worse $120 gift card for Uber and ShakeShack. Would you value a gift card at $120? Probably not (also sometimes gift cards usually have discounts). $120 Uber Gift Card != $120 cash

>I think a fair value for the credits is $200-$230 if you can fully use it. If you don't use Uber/UberEATs or the food credit then of course it's worth much less.

>If that's the case now, your effective AF is ~$20-50.Fair. A card less focused on these monthly credits would be the Chase Sapphire Preferred. $95 a year and it casts a wide net on high-point categories. 5x on travel, 3x on groceries and restaurants.Yep! The 5x on travel is only through their portal though and I've seen pretty mixed opinions on that. If that's not an issue it's a pretty good card!/r/CreditCards has a solid link in their sidebar to the [best cashback cards by category](https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/wiki/best_cash_back_cards_by_category) (no annual fees) if you're looking to maximize for a particular category.

Personally I don't really like the idea of high annual fee cards. /u/uoflcards22's Amex Gold recommendation is $250/year which is pretty unappealing imo - see [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/rp91uw/is_the_amex_gold_still_worthwhile/) for some decent discussion on both sides.

If you want a single card alternative I'd shoot for the [CapitalOne SavorOne](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/) (3% on dining, grocery, entertainment, and streaming). If you have a single high spend category, the Citi card below might be good instead.

If you're open to having multiple cards open you can get even more cash back, just make sure to pay them on time / set up autopay. You'll also probably have to space things out since some banks deny if you've had too many recent inquiries, so prioritize applying for the category you spend the most on. Some recommendations if you go this route (these all have no annual fee):

- Citi Custom Cash for 5% (up to 500/mo) on your top spending category (usually groceries for me)
- US Bank Altitude Go for 4% on dining
- Bank of America Customized Cash for 3% on a category you choose (I go for online shopping - it's pretty broad and not frequently offered by other cards)
- Venmo credit card for 3% back on your top spend category
- FNBO Getaway for 3% back on travel

Hopefully some of that is helpful!citi custom cash gives back 5% on any one category up to $500 spend a month if you want a card without an annual fee. right now chase freedom unlimited has a great sign up bonus with 6.5% travel, 4.5% dining, and 3% on everything else so that would actually be my first pick.I‚Äôve had a great experience with Apple Card. Was my second credit card after Discover Student and got a great credit limit. No fees, 2% back on everything you buy with Apple Pay (which can basically be everything these days), 3% on certain things like Panera, Apple, Nike, Uber, etc. and 1% when you use the physical card. You can also finance any Apple product interest free over a period of time, so I‚Äôve found it to be great as a power Apple user but it may or may not suit your needs.There's a good counterpoint from /u/dabelong in the thread I linked:

I‚Äôm currently a Cornell student and going to intern in Philadelphia for fall semester. I‚Äôm looking for a room/an apt to sublet for ONLY fall semester (Mid August to Mid December) with a budget between $600-$700/month. My ideal location is near Upenn and Drexel. Please text me if you have any room/apt available!

Thank you!You should check the Upenn and Drexel housing groups on Facebook. Rent in UCity has gone up so unless you‚Äôre willing to share a room in a house with lots of people (shared bathrooms between 2-3 people) or live farther off campus (less connections to Public Transport) expect to pay 750-800.Experience being tutor for Weingarten CenterHi! I'm interested in being a tutor for CIS121(0) next semester (looking to dedicate \~5hrs / week to it) and was wondering what it's like (time commitment, what you have to do, flexibility etc...). Thanks in advance!I was a tutor this past semester and this is all basically still true!

One thing that could change is that they might implement a system next year that automatically assigns weekly meeting times to tutors and tutees instead of leaving it to them to figure out when to meet.

Also, I‚Äôll add that in my training, they stressed that tutoring should be mostly tutee-led. So as a tutor, you won‚Äôt need to arrive at tutoring sessions with, like, a clear plan of how you will spend the next hour or two. Instead, you let your tutees decide how to spend the session. I would let my tutees bring me practice problems that were confusing them, or topics they didn‚Äôt quite understand, etc. and go from there.Thanks so much for the insight! That's super helpful as I thought I'd have to prep a lot of material etc.My experience is a couple years old now and I didn't tutor CIS, but when I worked there they required 3 hr/wk minimum. Beyond that it was super flexible: you tell them the maximum hr/wk you can do, you schedule days/times with your tutee(s), and you decide what and how to teach. You get some training on basic teaching strategies, but after that it's up to you.Thanks so much for the insight!

+1 215-670-5843As a CAS transfer, is it possible to get into an uncoordinated dual degree with engineering and subsequently drop the CAS degree?Ok I know I know this all sounds terrible but please hear me out. I‚Äôm a sophomore transfer to cas interested in computational biology. I know this is definitely my fault but I did not read the fine text regarding transferring to Penn. 

Apparently, Penn accepts NO credits for any college coursework done during the duration of high school. I think this would be fine for most people, but unfortunately for me, I‚Äôve done more than half of my biology degree through courses taken at colleges when I was in high school. My old school accepted all the credits and honestly pretty much every other school accepted them except Penn. If I were to follow through with the computational biology degree at Penn, I‚Äôd be starting completely anew, retaking a ton of courses. I feel like that would be a terrible waste of my time at Penn. 

However, I‚Äôve looked into it, and realized Penn‚Äôs CIS program offers a computational biology concentration, with more emphasis obviously on computer science than biology. If I were to follow through with this major, I‚Äôd have a lot more opportunities to explore the computational side of compbio (ie: Ml, algorithms) as well as avoid retaking most of my classes. Unfortunately though, transfers are not allowed to apply for internal transfer to engineering. So, i was thinking about doing a dual degree with engineering (allowed for transfers) and subsequently dropping my compbio degree. Would this plan work and does it make sense? Any thoughts are much appreciated.Would that be a good idea..? I don‚Äôt want to get off on bad terms with them. They would have to approve of me dropping CAS if I were to ever do this switcheroo rightYes, it‚Äôs a great idea. They‚Äôll give you the advice you need. It‚Äôs their job. You have legitimate questions. No one should get angry about a transfer student wanting to transfer majors.Talk to an advisorI see. Was this because you were disallowed from doing what I‚Äôm planning or because you decided retaking the courses would be better?Just decided retaking was betterI was in the same situation as a gen bio major, decided to go ahead and retake the courses. Found that tho some courses were easier for me I still learned a lot of things I haven‚Äôt learned before since penn teaches it differently. This also gave me the opportunity to do other things besides academics which I highly recommend as there is so much more to do here at penn. Personally I feel that spending all my time at penn on academics would‚Äôve been a waste of time taking away from the many experiences that I have encountered at penn. Wouldn‚Äôt change a thingYes, it‚Äôs a great idea. They‚Äôll give you the advice you need. It‚Äôs their job. You have legitimate questions.
