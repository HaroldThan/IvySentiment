Megathread for admitted students
**Admitted students:** First of all, congratulations on all your hard work! Now you get to have the happiest of worries on which great institution to call your alma mater :) Post all your questions and comments here. This includes questions about undergrad and grad school admissions alike. We hope to welcome you to the Yale community but also feel free to ask us why it might not necessarily be the best choice for you. Individual posts outside of this megathread are subject to removal.

**Students and alumni**: Let's try our best to give constructive, specific feedback to all prospective Yalies and refrain from comments that would discourage them in any way.
Where did you find that review form if you don't mind me asking?

For current students who have gone through the financial aid review process: about how long does it take and how can I increase my chances of success? I'm in a somewhat complicated financial situation where my parents filed taxes jointly in 2020 but divorced last year, so my parents can't afford to pay as much as the 2020 return would suggest. 

I submitted a review form on Sunday and included results of the Net Price Calculator for each parent and added together the net cost which gave me an estimate that is about $13k less than my current cost and am currently waiting to hear back. Any experience with using the Net Price Calculator in negotiating and how faithful they are to what it estimates? All the info I put on there is the same as what I submitted through the FAFSA, IDOC, CSS Profile except for savings and investment values which have changed slightly.

If that doesn't work, my backup plan is to try to get them to match with Bowdoin. I was not admitted to any other Ivies or Stanford + MIT so I unfortunately can't use that. Bowdoin is still a top 10 LAC by most metrics however and also offers grant-based "100% need met" aid. Under ordinary circumstances, Yale would be more generous than Bowdoin but their current net cost for me is still $7k less than Yale's. Has anyone previously tried to do this or think they'll consider Bowdoin's offer?

Sorry for all the questions lol, just nervous about this whole thing since I really want to attend but this cost is in the way  and I only have under a month now to get it figured out.

EDIT for those still in this thread: Just got back with an offer $14k less than what it was and even more generous than I expected! The review process was easy and relatively quick taking only 5 days. Can't wait to attend!
What’s the entrepreneurial ecosystem like at Yale?
How’s the black / queer community at Yale? Feel free to comment or pm your experiences
You’ll be semi-randomly assigned a residential college, and I believe both the Dean and Head of a college look through housing questionnaires to match people up with roommates/suitemates. After your first year, you’ll have the option to switch res colleges (there’s a whole process involved with that though, and most people don’t transfer) and choose who you live with (within your class year and college)!

Edit: as of this year they have mixed college housing options but it is fairly limited and I’m not sure how it works
How does the whole housing/roommate situation work? Is it all random or do you pick/find your own roommate and pick which residential college you want to be in? Thanks!!
Correct!
Thank you!

How does this fit into the Major Requirements on [here](https://humanities.yale.edu/sites/default/files/resize/images/revisedroadmap%20%281%29%20%282%29-391x600.jpg)?
Am I right in thinking that after Directed Studies, I'll have fulfilled 6 out of 14 of the courses needed for a Humanities Major?
It’s actually relatively hard to join clubs I find. There are a lot where you can simply sign up but most have some form of application (a google doc and maybe a short essay). Others are quite competitive. There will definitely be plenty of clubs for you to join, it just might not be the exact one you wanted.

Social life is really what you make of it. Some spaces are exclusive-ish due to covid restrictions limiting the number of people who can attend gatherings. But there are a decent number of options. Only big difference is that there isn’t a huge bar scene around campus.
Ooh thank you for doing this!

1. How easy is it to join clubs? Is there an extensive application process for most of them?
2. What's the social life like at Yale? Would it be possible to have the typical American college experience there?
Depends on the majors tbh. I know some people who double majored because they had many overlapping classes between the majors and it made sense to. I wanted to double major but the two majors had nothing in common so it wasn’t feasible to do both, now I just take classes in the one field for fun. A lot of people complete their study abroad in the summer, where it doesn’t compete with their semester classes, so that should be doable (unless double majoring requires that you take lots of summer credits at Yale to meet all the major requirements).
What’s it like double majoring at yale? is it worth it, is it too much work? do you regret double majoring at all? and can i still study abroad with a double major?
Any other incoming graduate students want to make a group chat?
https://archaeology.yale.edu/academics/ma-degree-archaeological-studies here’s the starting point
Thanks.  I actually have already seen that numerous times.  Where do I go from there?
Inquiries may be directed to Director of Graduate Studies, c/o Registrar, Archaeological Studies, Department of Anthropology, Yale University, PO Box 208277, New Haven CT 06520-8277, or via email, samantha.ware@yale.edu.
What are Yale's PhD application process like for Archaeology?  I'm a junior in an IT program at a small school in NJ, but I have taken lots of anthro/archy classes.  Only I did bad on most of them because As scared me (don't worry, I talk to a professional every week about this).  But now I have a 4.0 in my new major and my new school.  Also, is it true that you can specialize in Warfare Archaeology as a PhD archaeology student at Yale?
Any Econ majors here? Tobin scholars?
i'm interested in ecology, environmental science, and statistics, and i am considering premed (how's the grading at yale?)! any info about those four subjects would be greatly appreciated, along with any other general tidbits about the school, positive or negative! i'm already aware that the price, the potential elitism, and the lack of AC (i'm from the south) may be potential issues, but that's where my knowledge stops.  
  
thank you :)
did anyone here do the foot base camp orientation? what did you think of it?
Can anyone help me find the First Year Housing and Advising Form? I've looked everywhere on YaleConnect/App Portal/Yale College website and can't find it.
I can’t speak about differences in rigor or Camp Yale. I can say that the undergrad classes at Yale are amazingly great. 

As opposed to using rate my professor at Yale, end of semester course evaluation data is aggregated and publicized in an internal database for future students to reference when registering. You’ll see students’ comments and overall course ratings.

Yale has a club golf team for non-pros! Club sports are great fun and you’ll meet a lot of friends. See here: https://sportsandrecreation.yale.edu/club-golf

There aren’t many apartment complexes around Yale, rather two-story houses are typically divided into two apartments, many near Yale Shuttle stops. Apartments are listed in the Yale Housing Facebook group! If you have the opportunity to live on campus in a residential college, I really recommend. It’s a tremendously great experience.

I hope this helped!
Hi, I might be transferring there in the Fall and have some questions:

• For CC transfers, how drastic was the change in work load? I found it really easy to maintain a 4.0 at CC, but I worry that I’m not smart enough for Yale tbh

• EP&E or Econ and why? I like EP&E but I want to double major and it might be easier to graduate on time with Econ since it’s less classes

• How feasible is double majoring in EP&E and Psych?

• Thoughts on the Camp Yale Programs? I think I might enroll in one but trying to decide which one

• I noticed there aren’t many reviews for professors on RMP, do Yalies use a different site for that?

• How accessible are sports for non-pros? I want to play golf and a few other things but am barely learning

• Recommendations for pet-friendly apartment complexes within walking or shuttle distance to Yale?

Thanks in advance

Summer Volleyball Intramural // For Fun
Heyyo! My name is Josh and I am here at Yale for a summer research program.  I was wondering if anyone know anything about summer intramural teams for volleyballs, or if anyone knows a group of people that just plays for fun in the afternoon's :))
Global Affairs Major Class Selection
Hey everyone! I'm an incoming freshman to Yale College, and I've been planning my classes for the fall/spring and had a few questions. I want to major in Global Affairs, so I have to take Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Applied Quantitative Analysis 1, Applied Quantitative Analysis II, Approaches to International Security, and Approaches to International Development.

&#x200B;

I know I have to apply for my major since it's limited access, and it's quite competitive, so I want to take the right classes to have the best chance of being accepted into my major. I was wondering what the best courses to take each semester would be? For the fall I was thinking about taking: Propaganda, Ideology, and Democracy, Origins of U.S. Global Power, Gateway to Global Affairs, and my freshman seminar. Would it be wise to swap out one of them for Applied Quantitative Analysis 1? I'm bad at math so I don't want to overwork myself the first semester, but Applied Quantitative Analysis 1 isn't available in the spring.

&#x200B;

When do you recommend I begin my language? I want to improve my Spanish skills and learn Mandarin, but I don't know if I'll have enough time for that. I'm also interested in applying to be a human rights scholar, so what classes do you recommend I take to have a good chance at being accepted for that?
From what I’ve heard, Global Affairs isn’t that competitive. If you show a commitment to completing the requirements and a genuine interest in foreign affairs, you should get into the major. 

I’d say for your first year, try to keep an open mind and don’t overcommit to the major. Most people take the intro econ sequence their first year and then take AQA I in their sophomore fall.

If you’re starting a language at L1, you should start now as you have to reach L5 for Global Affairs. If you’re starting from L3, you can wait a bit more.
global application considers how likely you are to finish the major as one of the important criteria. some of the major milestones are:
- L5 in a language
- Having finished/finishing Intermediate Econ (either one)
- Having taken AQA 1 or equivalents
GLBL electives are nice but theyre more about displaying your interest. AQA 1 is not that math-heavy; if anything it tries to be theoretical with basic statistics. I would say that if you fulfil two of these three, you are very much guaranteed to be accepted. I would recommend not stacking all GLBL electives early on. Some of them are good seminars that will prioritize GLBL majors anyway, so you can take them a bit later.
Residential College System Questions
Hey all,

I'm a prospective student looking at Yale, and I have some questions about the Res College system. 

A little bit of backstory as to why I'm skeptical of RCs: I go to a high school with a "House System" that operates very similarly to the RC system; each House has its own dorm building (boarding school), room in the dining hall, intramural teams, flag, crest, you name it. And while House pride is a big part of the experience here, I've also found it to be somewhat constricting—people really mainly mix with others in their House, and even if you do want to transcend those boundaries, institutional rules can make it difficult. 

Given that Yale has, quite literally, the same system (I'm not exaggerating; the spiel that I was instructed to give prospective students at my school was almost verbatim what I heard on my tour), does this kind of segmentation often happen there? Between Yale and Princeton (I haven't toured any other RC colleges yet), the Res College system seems to be a lot larger of a centerpiece of campus life at Yale, and I'm somewhat concerned that I may end up getting stuck in the same boxes once again. 

Thanks so much!
Questions for Course Selection as an Incoming Freshman
Hello! I'm an incoming freshman who's hoping to have a few questions about their course selection answered :D I've been playing around a little with coursetable since it recently opened for incoming people, and I have a few (albeit detailed) concerns about which courses I should pick.

1. Is there a specific building for korean language classes?

2. Is 15 minutes... a "reasonable" amount of time to get to another class? I have these two classes that I'm really hoping to take (one of which being korean^), but I'm not sure if I'm being ballsy trying to get to another class in 15 minutes. Not to mention risking being late but also downtime from attending another class. Though I'm accustomed to only having 5 minutes to prepare before another class from high school, I'm not sure if this changes in college.

3. Is 2 distributional/major credit classes and 2 purely-for-fun classes reasonable for the first semester? Though I am trying my best to pick classes that I know I will enjoy, I know there are some classes that I'll have to take to fulfill credit requirements. Not sure if I should be focusing on fulfilling distributional/major credits this early since I haven't decided on a major yet (looking at... ~5 options + ik I won't decide until at least after freshman year) and distributional credits seem pretty easy to fulfill, but I also don't want to be a frantic junior later trying to graduate with the major I want on time. Any advice on how to approach course selection as a freshman and potentially beyond?

4. Are there any courses that I *must* take in my freshman year? Like, courses that all freshmen should take or highly recommend for freshmen to take? I was trying to search for this but couldn't find the right site(?), so if anyone could potentially lead me in the right direction, I'd greatly appreciate it.
Wait so instead of the shopping period, is there another way to sit in on classes that we're interested in?
Shopping period still exists it’s just four days instead of 9.
1. Not sure, I would guess no.

2. Almost certainly yes, unless you’re going from science hill to the art school or vice versa.

3. Certainly reasonable for a first semester, although I would recommend at least one of those two distributional/major credit courses are less “fun,” aka one of the ones you’re less looking forward to taking (aka math as an art major or intro bio as a potential environmental studies major, etc). No need to jump straight to your least favorite area in your first semester, but definitely don’t rush to fulfill strictly the things you’re 100% jazzed about. In general, 1-2 fun classes a semester is reasonable for almost all majors (and it’s a great way to fill distributional credits too!) but I would recommend taking something broad and some general intro class, ideally applicable to multiple majors, your freshman year.

4. No, but I’d you don’t take a first year seminar, you’re missing out. Find one you’re interested in, either this or next semester (or both) and go for it. They are mostly rad, easy, and unique.

General advice: while yale is doing their best to kill shopping period, going and shopping is still quite useful and can get you into things you otherwise wouldn’t. That being said you’re a first year, so you will be at the bottom of most wait lists (excluding first year seminars, which you should try to visit even if you don’t instantly get in if they mean a lot to you, because someone *always* drops). That being said, every subsequent year will be easier and easier for you to get into classes, so do your best to not be discouraged if you don’t get a perfect setup first time!
1. I have no idea about Korean, but Italian classes are scattered everywhere, so that might extend to Korean.

2. Yeah, it's pretty reasonable most of the time, but if the first class ends up going over routinely it'd become a pain, and can also be a pain if they're across campus from each other (although a bike or scooter can mitigate that problem).

3. Yeah, that's a decent distribution of stuff. If you had a pretty intense major I might recommend 3, but you should be fine (keep in mind that your "fun" classes should still fill SC/SS/HU requirements, which is good. If you know you'll probably major in a specific broad area, try looking for fun classes that fall outside of that so you can get those distributionals)

4. Only that you must have 2 classes that are WR, QR, or Language, although definitely try to do a first year seminar.

Also keep in mind that if a class is say QR and SC it can only count for one of those requirements.
I found courses by searching up yale course catalog and the first link was https://courses.yale.edu/
Hi! I’m also a first year student, may I ask where you’re accessing the course selections?
Shopping period still exists it’s just four days instead of 9.

Any homeschooled students currently at Yale?
Hi, I don't see the admissions megathread anymore and wasn't sure if this qualified as such a question, my apologies in advance just in case!  I'm a homeschooled student really interested in applying and I wanted to know any homeschooled students' experiences, both with the application process and studying at Yale in general!  I've read up on Yale's articles for homeschooled applicants which were incredibly helpful, but I would love to hear about any personal experience as well.  Thank you so much, really appreciate it :)
Everyone *seems* homeschooled, if that helps.
Career Plans of Physics Majors @ Yale?
Fellow Physics majors, what are you guys' career prospects after undergrad/postgrad. Do you guys wish to remain in academia and seek faculty positions in colleges or go find industry work elsewhere?
Most physics undergrads in my year started at PhD programs immediately after graduation.

Some took a short gap year in industry before starting a PhD program.

Several others went into software engineering or quant roles in industry, but this was a less common path than continuing to graduate school.
Jobs with Living Wage?
Hey! I'll be attending YSPH this fall and moving to East Rock in August. 

As I get closer to moving, the more anxious I've been getting in regards to being able to afford to live. I know I can take out a larger loan to cover living expenses, but really trying not to do that. I've been applying to some jobs already (mainly remote non-profit type work), but I've been striking out. 

For students that work and make a living wage: do you have any tips? I've been on the student employment page and there are some research jobs that seem pretty solid (with a pretty good wage), but I imagine it's pretty competitive?
I would note that to the best of my knowledge, yale wages are not beholden to the new haven min wage of 17.48 (although I’m not finding too many articles referencing this so I’m not sure if the new haven rate changed), and is instead a bit lower, so working at an establishment outside the school would probably give you a better hourly. Reaching out to a professor/lab that I get to be close to has worked for me in the past at securing a job, and some both help mentor you and pay you if you build a close relationship with them.
Math 244 or CPSC 202?
Anyone know much about the difference between these two? Math 244 seems to be a bit more difficult with more coverage of proofs, but I just finished Math 225 and feel pretty comfortable with my proof-writing abilities so far. Do either of these classes assume you have a lot of experience with proof-writing?
from the post it sounds like you should definitely take 244 if you want to take the class that you'll learn the most from. 202 is really basic/easy and should be taken if you don't have any math background or don't care for sophistication and want to get on with the degree requirements.
what should i bring to fsy?
i’m trying to look on the website and through emails for recommendations on what to bring but there isn’t much… for people who have gone to fsy what do you think are essentials to bring, especially those you might not immediately think of? do you recommend bringing anything that isn’t essential but might make the experience more fun? what should i absolutely not bring because it would just be too much and a pain?
What does this mean? (BA prerequisites)
I'm interested in going to Yale College for a BA, with a concentration in graphic design. However, it seems like there are prerequisites for the program. This is what this website ( http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/art/ ) says:

"The prerequisites for acceptance into the major are a sophomore review, which is an intensive advising session and evaluation of work from studio courses taken at the Yale School of Art, and five introductory courses"

Does this mean that I have to apply to Yale as another major, and start the BA program in my 3rd year after doing the sophomore review in my sophomore year, resulting in 6 years of study for 1 major? Or something else entirely?

Thanks!
Oh that makes so much more sense, seems like I was overthinking it haha. Thank you!!
You are accepted to Yale without a declared major, and you are expected to declare during your sophomore year. Then, you apply to the art major and, if accepted, you finish your remaining years as an art major. The whole thing (pre + post declaring) takes 4 years

Note that even when you have not yet declared your art major, you’re probably taking relevant classes
Oh that makes so much more sense, seems like I was overthinking it haha. Thank you!!
fin aid questions
can someone explain to me what the student share portion of the financial aid is? is it an amount that I need to pay the school or no?
also if anyone has received the start up grant (the one around 2k) can you tell me how we are supposed to access it?
I can actually help with this!!! So, there is no longer a Student Income Contribution, Yale got rid of it for this year :) which is super awesome because it was a massive financial burden on many students and families. So, if you get a 100% Yale grant/scholarship award, you will pay nothing to Yale. The only thing you would need to cover it like the flight here, etc. I got the startup grant this year, don’t know if it’s changed, but there’s a system called YalePay, and they’ll give you a “refund” and you add your direct deposit information, request the $2000 and then it’s deposited into your bank account. You can always call the Fin Aid office they’re usually nice and helpful people :) Also feel free to send me a DM and I can answer any other questions you might have!
Running at Yale
Hi everyone, I’m an incoming freshman to Yale. I run on a daily basis and want to continue to do so in college. Is New Haven a safe place to run alone? Does anyone know good casual running clubs in the area? Are there large parks or trails nearby? Thank you in advance for your advice!
There's a running club at Yale. From what I understand it's pretty accessible.
Yale let’s students have dogs?
Grad student
I run six miles a morning with my golden retriever. Never had a problem in the early morning. The Yale Golf Course is a great , safe run in the off season if you have a car. It connects to the water company running trails then up to Hopkins’ School trails. I sometimes do a longer run out to Lighthouse Point. I would not run at night. I take trash day off- so stinky. I have run East and West Rock parks but sketchy encounters happen.
I really got into running in new haven during the pandemic and I think it’s still my favorite place for daily runs! I never felt uncomfortable but I am a guy. My usual route was some variation of going up science hill, down prospect street, then back on Whitney or through east rock.
I keep running away from my responsibilities all the time
You’re pretty safe downtown if you’ll be in old campus. I’d suggest if you pass Popeyes on Whalley, a firehouse on Goeffe or if you see any signs saying Dixwell, it’s time to turn around.

yale housing/meal plan??
okay so im so confused right now because when i try to look up how much dorms are gonna be they give me the annual amount. so my question is, do i pay monthly or all at once? and if it is monthly do i divide it by 12 months ($875) or 9 months ($1166). 

the meal plan is also mandatory??? i cant afford to pay $7950 for food? cant i just tell them that i don’t want the meal plan or that i can’t afford it?
It all gets added with tuition into a single bill charged to your account that you can gradually pay. 


Keep in mind, if you get any financial aid, it will automatically go towards your food and housing as well.  


If you move off campus, you can opt out of a meal plan, but usually there's a rule that all first and second year students have to live on campus.
The other person who answered is correct, you pay everything in one bill at the start of each semester. The only thing to add is that if you want to pay gradually over the semester you have to sign up for the payment plan well in advance, otherwise you have to pay in full at the start of the semester.
Do you have to send in all your SAT scores when applying to Yale?
Or has that changed?
Do you know if there's a specific deadline to do that
June 24th I believe. I got an email abt this
wait what does this mean im very confused
If you’ve committed to Yale, you need to send in official scores through college board. The deadline to do this is June 24th according to the email I got if my memory serves me right
This is if you have applied and gotten in already? Like the last admissions cycle?
Yes! Sorry, I should’ve clarified
Yale is test-optional for this coming cycle but you can self-report scores on your application if you want to. If you are accepted and choose to enroll you will have to submit official scores.
I used score choice when I sent it, is that a problem?

Taking less than 4 credits?
I’m an incoming junior transfer and have some concerns about adjusting academically as well as socially to Yale. I am currently looking at signing up for 3.5 credits this fall. Will this require permission from a dean? I’m really trying to spend my first semester making sure I can adjust as best I can
You can try enrolling in 4.5 then drop
You will probably have to talk to your College Dean — they will tell you that you cannot drop any credits if you want to remain enrolled full time. But you can usually get approval for a 3.5 credit load.
I think just less than 3.5 credits needs dean approval
Downtown Housing?
Hi everyone. I’m an incoming MPH student and I’m trying to find housing with a roommate in the downtown area. Dwight/East Rock/WoosterSq have been suggested to us but we really value being close to med campus. 

Neither of us have been to New Haven so we were wondering if there’s any areas to avoid in downtown? We’re currently considering Crown Court but would love to  have any suggestions. 

Thanks!
Thank you!

game theory or game theory and political science? (ECON 159/ EPE 295)
which course is easier? my math skills are pretty weak so trying to figure out which the lesser evil is
ooh got it, thank you so much! that median sounds great lol
Keep in mind, for classes that are curved, a super high median can be annoying because one dumb mistake drops you below the A range.
FWIW I took 159 and it was fun and easy. We had like 4 psets and the exam medians were 100%. Easy A in my experience

Biochemistry (MB&B 300/301)
For any STEM people at Yale, I was wondering how much organic chemistry knowledge is required in the Principles of Biochemistry I class, MB&B 300. I am thinking about going abroad my Junior Fall, and I would have to take CHEM 220 and MB&B 300 concurrently to have a shot at completing MB&B as my major. Any advice?
As long as you're generally familiar with chemical properties, you won't need much else.  


Here are the chemistry-related topics that I can recall from the sequence: 


* Why the structure of amino acid side chains determine their properties (such as charge or bulkiness) 


* Dehydration/hydrolysis to form or cleave peptides and polysaccharides 


* Modifications to and oxidation of glucose 


* Oxidation reduction using a hydride


* Stability of bonds


* Why pH can affect the charge of a protein due to protonation/deprotonation


* pKa
Congratulations of Graduating!! I was planning on taking MB&B 300/301 as a sophomore, and then the physics sequence as a Junior. However, i am also considering taking PHYS 180/181 as a sophomore and then biochem as a junior. Both paths don't sound great, though.
I did physics/orgo as a sophomore and the biochem sequence junior year (didn’t do first year orgo). Worked out fine for me! It’s nice to finish the major classes early, but I’m not sure if it’s worth struggling through biochem without orgo first. If you do biochem as a junior it still gives you plenty of time to take other classes senior year — all I did in my spring semester related to my major was the MB&B thesis, and took a bunch of other random classes.
Other poster answered your question pretty well. I’m an MB&B major who just graduated. You could probably study up on the few things you do need to know — I might try to also know the basics of SN1/SN2 type reactions — which wouldn’t be too hard. However, taking both those classes at the same time would absolutely suck so just be aware of that. When are you planning on taking physics? If possible, I would try to prioritize taking orgo first and then try to do physics and MB&B 300 at the same time — which would also suck, but at least you won’t be trying to self-study orgo at the same time.

Will Yale rescind me?
Prefrosh here. Throwaway account. Primarily because of some mental health issues that I am now receiving treatment for, my grades in 2nd semester of ~~high school~~ senior year were uncharacteristically low. I'm a STEM major (as you can probably tell):

AP Science course: A+

Dual-credit Science course: A+

AP Social Studies Course: B+

AP Social Studies Course: B

Theology Course: C-

English Course: D+

I am extremely worried that Yale will rescind me. How do my prospects look? And is there anything I can do or say that would help me at this point?
I don't think Yale is yet aware of my situation—I have not yet sent my final transcript. Thank you for the response though. I'm thinking about how best to approach an admissions officer with this news.
If you mean they were bad this spring semester, I’m sure you would be able to discuss this with an admissions officer. I think, personally, that you’re probably fine and that furthermore they would have already given you a rough time if there was any major problem.
I second this. It took a month or two for me to be assigned to a therapist this year. I'm not sure if you can request to be assigned to someone now, but I definitely recommend looking into it. Each fall there is a huge influx of kids needing mental health care. It's best for you to get ahead of all that traffic.
First off, glad to hear you're getting treatment for whatever you're going through. As others have mentioned, proactively reaching out to admissions and explaining the situation will probably put you in the best possible position.

I don't know your situation, so please don't take what I'm about to say as an imperative, but have you considered whether you're feeling up to heading straight to Yale? I don't know the deferral policy, but I think admissions would look favorably on the idea that you wanted to take some time to address the things that became a serious problem for you this spring. Better that than having a similarly difficult first semester at college, or worse, having to leave mid-semester on medical leave, and having to go through the nightmarish readmission process.

At the very least, I'd encourage you to have a strong plan for how you're going to get support once you're in New Haven. Yale's mental health services are, to put it charitably, overburdened, and getting the resources you need may not be easy or expedient.

Please don't let what I've said discourage you. You were admitted, you belong, you're not alone in where you're at in life. It may sound trite, but taking care of yourself is the most important thing.
You should probably email them now and explain your situation. They will probably inquire about it when they see your grades, so better send an explanation now in anticipation. Still unlikely that they will rescind you.
Did your roommate face any consequences for the decline in his academic performance other than having to write that letter?   I personally have full confidence in my ability to put this behind me and succeed at Yale, but I need admissions to share that confidence. One of my concerns is that mental health issues are just not a good enough excuse—I should have just powered through.

He ended up being my sophomore roommate, so no. :)

He wrote about some social issues that came up and how that impacted him, but also how he planned to push through them in college.
Yikes. That's pretty harsh but matches some of the NACAC data that publics do it more often than privates.
I'd expect that Yale will reach out to you asking for an explanation, so you should be prepared to write a letter. It happened to my sophomore roommate when his grades dropped a fair bit to about where you did.

I do not believe you would have an admissions rescinded - they know that is largely not feasible at this point in the game.
I got in early but then was in a similar position after they got my first trimester grades for senior year. I got a B and a C in two classes I normally would have done well in if I wasn’t sick and having mental health issues. I ended up getting a very scarily worded (and weirdly enough, typo-filled?) email from my admissions officer saying this is an issue and that I needed to explain what happened. They were very receptive to my explanation and it never affected me again. Though it ended up being fine in the end for me, it was a really scary email to wake up to, and I was legitimately worried they were going to rescind me. 

I would encourage you to reach out proactively with your side of the story first before they come to hunt you down, and mention your plans for academic success at Yale like you mentioned here. But also, don’t just try to push through if you’re not feeling it - it’s totally fine to take time off first or at any point, and I’m sure they’d understand and let you even though you intended to matriculate next year. But no matter what you do, it’ll end up being okay - you deserve your spot, and they want you here and want to see you succeed!
I’m so sorry you’re struggling right now. This happened to me but I handled it very poorly and had my admissions to several universities rescinded. Please learn from my mistakes.

Be proactive and talk to an admissions officer/the accessibility services department before they contact you. This will help your credibility.

The admissions department has a lot of room to work with students if they can see that you care about what is going on. If they come to you it might look like you are trying to skate by without anyone noticing and they therefore might be less inclined to help you. 

Second, try to register with the accessibility department ASAP so that you have another department at Yale that can confirm your struggles to the admissions officer. Not only will it show that you care but it will demonstrate that you are trying to prevent this situation from repeating.

Best of luck. Reach out for help whenever you need it.
I’m not certain if they’ll rescind you, but they will most likely question you.
Are you talking about UC Berkeley or Berkeley College at Yale?
The UC! I actually did not know Yale had a college with the same name, cool
Then I don’t think you should say OP has a very high chance of having his/her offer rescinded. Each school’s admissions process works differently, and UC is known for placing greater emphasis on the GPA than many other top schools.
Alright, that is a fair point sorry

Like others have already stated, prepare for the worst and expect an AO to reach out. In addition, I would make sure your counselor is aware of your situation so they can vouch for you. If you have documented proof of your issues like a note from a professional that would also probably help as well. I don't think they would rescind you assuming you make sure that its verifiable.
Just have a good written explanation to share with Yale, and you should be fine.

Is it possible to join a varsity team as a walk on after coming to campus?
Specifically field hockey. Also if anyone has any experience playing a club sport I’d love to know your thoughts on how competitive club sports are and the time commitment needed, thanks!
See the answers I got [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/urpxhu/how_hard_is_it_to_walkon_for_football/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) while you wait for more specific answers
Yes
Did anyone here take more than 4.5 credits first semester?
I know they recommend 4.5, but how many people do more? For anyone who did more, was it too much to handle?
Don’t. Do. It. Seriously start slow and there will always be time to take more credits later. First semester is filled with so much stuff outside of classes just in terms of new experiences and you do not wanna be overly stressed or busy with school during that time. 4.5 credits is more than enough
workload all depends on ur specific classes. read syllabi carefully and figure out what weeks will be difficult. you want to avoid multiple big assignments due the same day at all costs, preferably avoid the same week. but yeah, to echo previous advice, be chill on work first semester. there's tons of time for that later. you'll want to have free time to meet ppl, go to parties, go to cool clubs, drop clubs, start new clubs, etc. be kind to yourself. no need to work hard immediately. even tho i def could have handled more work, i took a sec to get my bearings and am super glad i did so first semester.
I’ll add nuance to the standard advice here — while 5 classes first semester is very often a bad idea, if you’re set up well it can be a good experience. 

Personally I took five and enjoyed it because I made made great friends with others in those courses, so they doubled as social events and formed a lot of my friend group lol.

However, it worked out *only* because most of the courses covered material I was already familiar with from prior studies, so overall my coursework wasn’t a huge challenge. Also, one of my courses I took credit-D to further lighten my load.

The key is that your coursework first semester shouldn’t be a source of stress or challenge. There’s enough going on as-is, don’t try to challenge yourself with your classes. But, if you talk to your professors/froco and understand what you’re getting into, its a path some do enjoy.
Yeah, I am EPE and CS + Math, which is super tight.
If you haven’t taken a course at Yale yet that’s a very ambitious choice. Not saying it’s impossible, but think hard about those two. It’ll be hard to do well in both when you’re spread that thin
I have taken 2 years of all college course focusing on those subjects, hence the confidence. But definitely understand the concern! Going to reflect more and more over the summer.
I’ll caution that I had experience with college courses before starting at Yale and found Yale’s classes to be significantly harder. Obviously this will depend on different majors etc, but there’s not a major disadvantage to taking a lighter first semester and then doing a more rigorous one second.
I did 5.5. Not worth it unless you have a game plan (e.g. completely unrelated double major) in mind
the only person I knew who did more was someone taking piano lessons for credit, and she was a piano prodigy so that didn’t really count (she didn’t have to put much time into it). I found 3.5 to be really nice first semester, definitely would not have been able to do 5 (did 5.5 last semester as a junior and it was exhausting). 4 or 4.5 is the best course load, especially as a first year!
I think it really depends on your priorities, your background, the kind of classes that you plan to take (lecture vs. seminar; stem vs. humanities, social sciences, etc.), and how much time you're willing to invest in them. I took 5.5 (4 classes + a 1.5 credit language class) and I actually don't regret it one bit because of how amazing and interesting all my humanities classes were. But there was significant work involved, I definitely didn't go out as much as some of my friends did (although this was also influenced by my preferences). I also came from a pretty competitive public high school and was relatively well-prepared to handle the workload, time management, etc, which I'm sure helped loads. So I think whether you regret it or not depends on a case-by-case basis.

I'm sure there's a considerable amount of people who take 5 classes their first semester, but I wouldn't put it as the majority.
I took 6 credits and found it easy idk. I also skipped like 3 classes cuz they were all lecture and recorded. But it’s worth because I get more time later to focus on hard seminars

Is the ethics, economics, and politics major stressful/hard?
Like how hard is the material and how much time commitment is needed per day
My bf does it and it’s definitely work like any other major but certainly not as pull-your-hair-out difficult/tedious as STEM. Seems like a fair amount of writing more than anything else

It is one of the easiest majors at yale. I thought this was well known. I would say if you really want to get something out of your yale education just major in econ instead

Any fun science course rec to fulfill the requirements?
As an art major, I still have one more science class to fulfill my undergrad distributional requirement. Not looking for an easy pass, but was wondering if there are any less intimidating classes for non-STEM student
Astro 160? Really enjoyed that class, also as a non science major
Do you know any course numbers?
Thanks a lot 💙
Yeah that one. I got kicked out. I wish they would offer like a WWII or English class that’s for stem only to make things fair, but 🤷🏾‍♂️
Nah been a while
Thx for your recs!
Yep. Good luck
There are lots! I think there’s some class called science of the cosmos or some such that stem students actually aren’t allowed to take because it’s too easy. There’s also a musical instrument design class offered in the CEID that I think an artist would enjoy
Anything in astronomy, seriously.

MS Comp Sci vs Full Time
Hi everyone,

I just finished bachelor's degrees in Comp Sci and Statistics from a T5-T10 public university in 3 yrs. 

I have the opportunity to complete an MS in Comp Sci at Yale, fully funded with a 24K annual stipend for 2 yrs.

I think I like ML, but am not heartset on it. Most people at Amazon are telling me just to stay and go full time since a master's in CS supposedly adds little value especially since I have work authorization, but I would like to hear what you guys
think of:

- The quality of upper division CS classes
- The value of Yale on a CS resume
- The ability of grad students to mingle with undergrads/socialize

Feel free to share anything else! Non-CS people are surprised I am considering this and many think I am potentially turning down this exciting opportunity.

Thanks in advance!
Master’s is not worth it—only PhDs really open more doors. Just go to Amazon, it’ll add enough clout to your resume to get interviews most places, and probably more value to recruiters than any degree by itself. Only doors Yale might open that Amazon won’t are maybe roles in quant firms (typically recruit out of school rather than industry lateral, care about prestige, etc.).

Upper division CS class quality is variable. Some real stars, a couple real stinkers, most somewhere in between. Grad students don’t socialize much with undergrads, even though they share classes in CS.
>The quality of upper division CS classes

Very hit or miss. There's a couple great profs, but in general, you'll find significantly more variety of upper division CS classes at a school with a larger CS program. This is not an issue for undergrad, but for a masters program focused on CS it will limit your breadth and growth.

&#x200B;

>The value of Yale on a CS resume

Fairly strong -- it's good enough to get you past a resume screen for nearly any job. But, a full-time job at Amazon is more significant signal for future employers.

&#x200B;

>The ability of grad students to mingle with undergrads/socialize

Quite limited. If you go in with the intention to mingle you probably can, but in my experience as a CS undergrad who took several upper division classes I don't think we knew any grad students well.

\-----

FWIW many of my friends did the joint BS+MS ([link](https://dus.cs.yale.edu/bs+ms.html)) in computer science, those who did the MS have pretty much identical career paths and compensations so far (3-4 years out of graduation) as those who did not. If you think you'd like the program, go for it! But if you're doing it only for future job prospects I'd reconsider.
Not convinced about the lack of value of a masters - for the colleges where data is available, you can see a considerable 30-40% increase in salary for undergrad vs masters. For the other questions:

Quality of upper division classes: I generally haven't heard anything too worrying about most upper division classes, but I haven't took any.

Value of Yale on a CS resume - Yale has a higher 3-year salary than Harvard, MIT and Stanford (according to [ed.gov](https://ed.gov)), and so I would say *pretty good*. I can't comment on how much of an improvement it is versus your current degree, but it certainly wouldn't be a reduction in value.

Socialisation: I find grad students tend to socialise with each other, and undergrads with each other. There are many groups that feature both UGs + Grads, but most are seemingly dominated by one over the other. You'll have a perfectly strong social life, but I doubt it will involve too many undergrads tbh.
Take it, holy shit this would be a dream for me
I am an Yale College alum currently working as a Staff Software Engineer—if it were me, I would do the MS. It will enable you to avoid working on “solved” problems (eg glue code) when you do get on the market and you’ll also be able to command a higher salary.
mid-orientation program for transfers?
i'm an incoming sophomore transfer (but i took a gap year so i'm currently 20) thinking about the mid-orientation programs. i know that FOCUS has a transfer-specific program, but do the other programs put transfers in groups with only first years? i'm interested in FOOT but idk how i feel about being 20 in a group with 18-year-olds trying to make friends with other 18-year-olds (especially bc the social aspect is supposed to be a big draw). has anyone done foot and had a transfer student in their group?
my year had a lot of freshman come in having taken a gap year, so we ranged from 17-20, and it wasn't weird at all.
There are transfers who are 25 and they’re fine. But there are also way older transfers. It’s no big deal.
I transferred, did FOOT, was only transfer in the group, and I had a blast. I had no problem meshing with the freshmen, and some of us are friends to this day.
Agreed. Because of internationals and gap years, my first year peers were 17 to 21. 20 is not that bad.
You are their age. There is literally no difference between an 18 year old and a 20 year old!

Hey guys where can I get a cheap lab coat from? Like the student one
Please let me know have a week to get it sorted Thankss!
Awesome Thankyou!!!
I may have one you can have. What size do you need?
yea sure that would be awesome.Small or medium-are you selling it?
You can get cheap white lab coats from Amazon. If you have limited time, Amazon lockers can be faster than the on campus recurving center.

Neighbourhoods to Avoid in New Haven
Hey all!

I'm an incoming MPH student at Yale School of Public Health and, as an international student, I'm not too familiar with the New Haven area. I was wondering if there are any neighbourhoods in New Haven that are considered to be "unsafe" or that we should generally avoid? Thanks so much!
I wouldn’t necessarily call east rock perfectly safe but it’s the best we’ve got.
Pretty much all Yalies who live off campus live either in Dwight, East Rock or Downtown, areas that are all perfectly safe. There are unsafe places in New Haven, they're just not the places Yalies really live in.
Word. Get out of your safe space / bubble
At Yale grad school, we lived in Fair Haven. It’s known as a dangerous neighborhood but we really liked having a whole house, being able to run out to lighthouse point in the mornings, and meeting people outside the bubble.
Interesting username. You might know that the author of the book which shares your username, Paul Kalanithi, was a graduate of Yale Med School. Will you be living in Harkness in your first year? There were lots of MPH students along with med students there, and that's a good way to get to know lots of people.

I never ventured far locally on foot compared to car, so I can only describe a small area. I felt safe around the Yale campus. My general range was south to Anlyan Center--consider a walking buddy if you're going further to Amistad, west to Park St., east to State St. (though beyond that to Frank Pepe and Sally's Apizza) north to Grove St. I'm sure plenty of places further than that are fine, but that's all I can speak to from experience.
Most YSPH students live n East Rock, Downtown, or Dwight.
What others said

If you want names, basically avoid any neighborhood with hill or hall in the name
Most neighborhoods there are pretty safe.

One rule of thumb is to look at Google Maps, plot out the walk to campus and see if it passes through areas with cafes/restaurants and/or major office or university buildings. If so, it's likely going to be pretty safe. If you're going to be walking along the edge of a highway, past a bunch of parking lots, and then through a neighborhood without any amenities then it might be less safe at night. You can also use Google Streetview to see what the walk will look like.

A bigger consideration might be proximity to campus, because that's going to impact how much walking you have to do. If you're biking or driving that doesn't matter as much though. There are a lot of great neighborhoods that are outside the typical walking distance but are worth considering.  Most of the other students will be near the Yale campus, but the CT Transit buses and bikes are good in New Haven and if you have a car it's pretty easy to park if you're going out to someone's place for drinks or whatnot. If you live farther out you might find a better deal on rent, but look out for slumlords (there are going to be some slumlords near campus too but most places are pretty fixed up and costly)
I wouldn’t necessarily call east rock perfectly safe but it’s the best we’ve got.

Yale Adobe Creative Cloud Access Issues
I’m a prospective student, who will be going to Yale in the coming fall, I found a Yale website saying how Yale offers Adobe Creative Cloud for free for students but it’s a few years old. Do they still offer this? When I try it says “access denied please contact admin”, is it possibly because I’m a prospective student?
Nope this worked like a dream! Thank you so much! I was just looking at an outdated website I guess.
Yep, definitely still a thing! [https://software.yale.edu/](https://software.yale.edu/) has all the software available to Yale students, though some of it might not work until you actually start in the fall.
Nope this worked like a dream! Thank you so much! I was just looking at an outdated website I guess.
ONEXYS
Has anyone done ONEXYS before? Would you recommend it?
Definitely. Really helps you know more about Yale and have people you can know before coming in
Undergrad degree
Hi! I've just found out that you can't apply for a Yale undergraduate degree if you already hold a undergrad degree from a different uni. I'm currently doing an undergrad in Australia and been wanting to apply to Yale for a different degree once I've finished this one. 

I'm just wondering what the reason is for this? 

Thanks :))
ohh ok that makes sense. thanks :))
It's the policy within many schools, not just Yale. The value derived from a second degree is substantially less as you're repeating many gen-eds etc, or the college may feel you have an unfair advantage over students doing their first degree.
Try grad school?
Yale is incredibly competitive as it is. I feel like it would be unfair to undergrad applicants to also have to go up against those who already have a degree in their pocket.
that's so strange that America does that. in Australia you can get as many bachelors as you want. but yeh looks like grad school is it hahah
that's so strange that America has that. In Australia you can get as many bachelors as you want. yeh looks like grad school is it hahah
Oh i didn’t know about that, interesting
This is literally every college. You’re not allowed to get two bachelors. Good news is you can still apply for grad school if you want to attend Yale
ohh ok that makes sense. thanks :))

Masters in European and Russian Studies Questions
Hi everyone! Prospective Masters student, just reaching out to enquire about how the application and admissions process went for
 current Yale E&RS students. 

Also, how robust is the financial aid for E&RS applicants?

I’m really interested in Yale for graduate school, I think I have a really good chance of getting in, but the most important factor to my decision is financial aid. 

Looking forward to responses!
Boxing at Yale
Any opportunities for undergraduates interested in boxing?

Not necessarily a ring, just punching bags at least.
There is equipment in the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, as well as some of the residential college fitness centers having their own punching bags. I believe there’s also various martial arts clubs
I heard the debate club often turns into a boxing match when verbal arguments are not convincing enough.
Pierson/davenport has a punching bag. It's a little to hard but its fine. Branford has a really nice heavy bag, as well as a nice speed bag.
There’s a heavy bag in the Benjamin Franklin College Gym, and there used to be one in the Fitness Center of Payne Whitney (haven’t been there in a while so idk if it’s still there).
Go out to fighting arts academy in Milford. We have some Yale students here
Gymnastics at Yale
Hi!

I was wondering - are there any male/co-ed recreational gymnastics options at Yale? It's one of my favorite activities and want to keep at it when coming next year
Oh, driving might be an issue; I'm an international student so I have no clue how my day-to-day would look like. Thanks for the response!
Hi! My boyfriend is in club gymnastics - I won’t lie, they seem to have trouble getting space (they can’t use varsity equipment :/ ), but they often make a 20 minute drive and use a private gym space!
Oh, driving might be an issue; I'm an international student so I have no clue how my day-to-day would look like. Thanks for the response!
How "woke" is Yale?
Elon Musk recently tweeted that Yale is ["the epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization".](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526975113597489154?s=21&t=KrZZY9r8k_qHVh1ybeoRqw) As Yale students, how true is this? I don't mind the downvotes this post will get.
MIT does this, it's honestly pretty cool. By that I mean on the internet, of course. Certainly hasn't made them less competitive lol.
Ask again and you go to jail not yale.

More seriously, if Yale was woke then it would open all its courses and research to everybody and minorities, not only paying students.
Wokeness is not about being leftist. 
I remember the story about that guy that used the word trap house is a mail and got everyone riled up.

Also fuck musk.
The YPU is only dominated by conservative parties because they are better at politics.  The vast majority of undergraduates are very liberal.  Yale's Young College Democrats outnumber the Young College Republicans by at least 20:1.
There's an overlap for sure - most 'woke' people you find are self-labelled 'progressive's and the like. I think the more likely reasoning for this isn't even that the students were offended - it is that some YLS students were looking at fucking with FedSoc students. FedSoc has certainly ended up in a tenuous position since the Trump presidency.
Being woke is actively anti-leftist. Being woke places higher stock on playing identity politics than it does over making material change in the lives of workers. 

Yale is aggressively woke by that standard. Even the conservative groups are very aware of how important woke-ness and meeting diversity quotas are at Yale.

Agree- fuck musk.
Yale College Republicans isn't even really active, there's groups entirely filled with Republicans (or would be republicans, if not for the current shitshows) that are much larger than the College Republicans group. The YPU being dominated by conservative groups shows there is an active and present conservative diaspora at yale - it's not really representative of Yale as a whole though, of course.
To this point, there's definitely a large, vocal portion of the student body that hold pretty centrist to conservative views who know to repeat buzz words to seem progressive 


It's one of the few places where someone will lecture you on imperialism in the third world while they've got an internship at the Pentagon lined up 



https://youtu.be/h4hP6nOB1dc
I understand.  I was in a fair number of those groups.
Honestly I think the wokeness is severely overplayed. Ted Cruz came to campus and the worst thing that happened is someone asked if he would suck a cock. I can think of at least 10 campuses across the US where such an event would probably result in physical altercations.

Yale has a *very* active conservative contingent on campus, the YPU is dominated by conservative parties, etc. Yale does not even have an active *explicitly* communist group (there are certainly left to far-left groups, and there are communists on campus, but I am not aware of any group that is explicitly communist in nature).
maybe the secret is that we're trying to get everyone's wifi to be as shitty as yalesecure
I find it hard to believe that a university that can barely keep the wifi connection stable for 24 hours is quietly and systematically upending a global world order that undeniably benefits it and it’s $40+ billion endowment.
Lots of college students do dopey political shit in every school in the country. When it happens at Yale it's front page news. 

Students are quite far left on average. There are lots of right-wing students who do well.
So do you believe Yale is woke?
Yale probably has its finger on the pulse of progressive trends more closely than other colleges because so many students are involved in activism, but the political breakdown isn't very different from any other university. 



Educated 20 year olds want to change the world. Sometimes it's helpful, sometimes it's myopic, but ultimately the obsession that Gen Xers in the media have with it is pretty ridiculous
There's a lot that could be analyzed about the idealism of college students, the privileged background of many here, and the positions of power to which a Yale graduate has access if you want to talk about politics on campus. 



However, at the heart of this, Elon is just a twitter loudmouth who's trying to insult a Yale professor that criticized him.  His words have no more weight than when he called that diver a "pedo guy"
I dunno there’s a lot of conservatives and neo liberals with the whole Yale community. Me? I’m more of an issues guy. I’m part conservative and part progressive, I believe in Medicare for all. 

Are there woke people on the grounds ya. But are they the majority at Yale? No. But it’s all on a case by case issue.
The article "My Semester With the Snowflakes" I think does a good job of explaining more about campus culture around "wokeness":

[James Hatch: My Semester With the Snowflakes](https://przekroj.pl/en/society/my-semester-with-the-snowflakes-james-hatch)
Elon Musk is a vampire in skinny jeans
Worked there for many years in a position with proximity to power. It is perhaps *barely* woke - at least speaking in terms of its leadership and how it runs as an organization. It’s more like a neoliberal’s wet dream. That’s not woke or left (not that that’s an equivalence, but idiots like Musk would have us think so). 

Musk is a clueless dolt who is masking his own personal BS and inadequate political compass. This view of Yale is no more than a shallow media trope willfully spread to garner views and stoke moral outrage.
Yale has some interesting kids, lol
It is pretty woke. Watch this video of a huge group of students yelling and crying at a professor, demanding an apology after a professor said that students should decide for themselves what Halloween costumes they want to wear. Watching this interaction is pretty repulsive to me, luckily I haven’t had to be around too much of this in my time here.

https://thefamiliarstrange.com/unpacking-the-yale-halloween-scandal/

https://youtu.be/hiMVx2C5_Wg
tru
almost all examples of yale being woke in this comment section are not anywhere near what yale students actually want. if you want to die on the hill of yalies being carriers of the woke virus, at least find good examples. the halloween altercation could have happened in brooklyn in the 90s; its only now that there is enough conviction and desire for change among undergraduate community that the incident happens.

Cheapest realistic living arrangements?
Hi, incoming YSM grad student here. What are the cheapest ways to find housing in and around Yale, that are not in dangerous areas? 
I do not mind many roommates, small rooms, religious organizations, sharing apartment with elderly, whatever it takes. We get a small stipend, but with health insurance for international students and moving, we don't have that much money left. 
Any advice appreciated.
I would recommend joining the Facebook group “Yale Grad Free & For Sale & Rent.” Lots of grad students post there looking for roommates.
Nope.  New Haven gets cold
Well insulated with a heater or rent a parking space with an outlet close. Showers at the YMCA. I’ve thought about it
You haven’t done it in New England

how strenuous is foot?
i’m thinking of doing the day trips and have no idea if i’m fit enough to do a foot trip. how far is the journey each day for the day trip?
got it, thank you so much!
I did the easiest one and it was really a breeze. One day we only hiked half a mile, I think the longest day was 5 miles. Just choose the easiest trip and you'll be fine!

edit: and now that I recall, the 5-mile day was actually a big loop around a lake, so we didn't have to carry our gear - just circled the lake w/o backpacks and came back to our camp already set up from the previous night.
What’s foot?
got it, thank you so much!
Greek Life
I want to get involved in Greek life on campus possibly. My brother was in Sig Ep at FSU so he's been trying to help me research but it's been pretty difficult finding information about how to rush and fraternities at Yale. I was interested in Alpha Delta Phi or Sigma Chi possibly? But honestly, any frat would be great I think. Any and all info would be appreciated :)
Yale frats have spring rush for freshmen so you wouldn’t be rushing first semester. If you go out during your first semester you’ll get a feel for the different frats here. For example, Sigma Chi is the “Asian frat” and AEPi is a “Jewish frat.” We also have some social clubs like Edon which is basically Sig Ep
Easiest Language
This has probably been asked like 1000 times but I'm a rising junior who hasn't completed their language requirement and really just need something easy. I've heard good things about Portuguese and Indonesian so far, can anybody who has taken either of these share their experience (L1-L3).
Indonesian is the easiest by far. Other contenders: Zulu, Yoruba, Polish, Akkadian, Italian (it’s a bit more difficult than the others on the list but there are more sections).

Also, check with your Dean but I thought foreign language had to be completed before the end of your junior year so you might have to get permission to finish it during your senior year.
Back in my day it was Yoruba
i have heard indonesian is gutty
Indo, italian with the right prof, Czech, Zulu
Any Drawbacks to the FSY program?
Would appreciate it if anyone who knows of the program could list the pros and cons
Yeah I think the worst thing was missing out on that summer with my high school friends, now that we’re in college every summer we have internships taking us all over the US. And losing out on that summer income was not fun, but as someone who worked all throughout high school I found it a relief (and we got more refund money from Yale that fall bc of missing out on that income).
I mean… you miss out on a large part of the last summer with your high school friends. You also don’t have much time to make money in a job. Otherwise, it’s an excellent program that will allow you to settle more easily come late august - and get rid of that English requirement.

How hard is it to Walk-on for football?
I come from a small school without a football team, so I might be naive when it comes to the difficulty of being selected for a football team, but is it possible to walk-on for Yale Football without previous experience? I played Varsity level D1 sports in high school, specifically basketball, and I am 6’6” 290 lbs and lift. I obviously wouldn’t start or anything, but I’d like the community and staying fit. I’m attending this fall. Thanks.

By the way, any other suggestions for possible varsity or club level teams would be appreciated, with my past experience in mind.
Thank you for the advice. I am definitely looking into rugby as well, since I want to play some sort of contact or "power" sport. I honestly do not think I would make the cut for club basketball (at least the a-team), since basketball in the US is a cut above where I am from (Canada). I assume most of those guys played AAU to some extent and were high minute players on their team throughout high school. Again, thank you for the advice.
Highly recommend club rugby. It’s a great sport and the group of guys is a lot of fun. The team has lots of players coming from a background in other sports. Way less of a time commitment than a D1 sport like football but the more effort you put in, the more you get out of it. Message me if you want more details
It's unlikely, but your best bet is to reach out to the coach directly.  They may have a "try-out" process available.   But a varsity commitment is like taking on a full-time job on top of everything else.

Club might be the best option -- you still can travel, have competition, and can be part of a team.  There is no club football, but many others including rugby and basketball.  See: [https://sportsandrecreation.yale.edu/club-sports-intramural-sports/club-sports/club-sport-directory](https://sportsandrecreation.yale.edu/club-sports-intramural-sports/club-sports/club-sport-directory) for contact info.
Judging by your football helmet avatar, I assume that you played football at Yale, if not another college. Do practices take up all 20 hours that are allowed by the NCAA? What would the tryout process look like? Should I just email the coach? Is there any possibility of me being able to travel and compete with the team, even if I’m just the third string backup?
Played in undergrad (not at Yale). Affiliated though grad school at Yale.

I’d reach out to the position coaches to express interest. I’m pretty sure they’ll be interested in your hard stats and basketball background - not many athletic 6’6” 290 lb guys walking around campus - but still be thoughtful with how you approach the conversation. You need to ensure that you’re pitching yourself as a workhorse who is ready to learn the game and contribute to the team however is needed. Nobody wants drama from a walk-on. (Email addresses for coaches: https://yalebulldogs.com/sports/football/coaches)

Walk-on workouts will likely be over the summer, so you may need to get to New Haven sooner than planned. They’ll likely run you though some solo drills, combine style tests (40, bench, broad and vertical, etc), and possibly some scout team plays.

From what I understand, the Ivy League has a little more flexibility with team travel than scholarship based programs. But no clue where they draw the line.

You’ll likely be maxing out NCAA accountable hours (20 in season + spring ball and 10 in off-season), so it’s still a big time commitment.
Thank you so much for all the advice. I will definately be thoughtful and try to come off as humble as possible. I tried to make sure of that in the post, showing that I recognize the fact that without a strong high school background in Football I already have a slim chance. I'll make sure to be in the gym constantly this summer (was already planning on it, but now it will be more athletics focused rather than bodybuilding) now that I know there exists a possibility. Again, thank you so much for all your advice.
Hopefully the coach gets back to you quickly.  If you have any videos of you playing or working out, that might be helpful to send so he can tell you are the real deal with those stats.
For 99.99% of people, I’d say it’s highly unlikely. But given your rare body size and decent athleticism, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’d take you as a practice squad DL. OL might be a little tougher without experience - a lot more goes into scheming and field awareness - but it’s possible and probably a better fit for your higher weight.
i really recommend you try out for the rugby team. You’re build is great for it and it’s an amazing sport
the club powerlifting team is pretty cool ;)

Celeb Kids at Yale
 Was talking to my brother at Yale the other day and he told me that a lot of celeb kids go there. Is it really true that children/relatives of A-list celebrities/TV personalities etc are currently at Ivies/T10s but current students are supposed to be lowkey about them?
You don't even have to act low-key: most of the time you won't realize they're famous.
You could also just Google them I guess
You do not know who is a celeb kid unless they choose to tell everyone else.

Yes.
Why is this a thread every single time new Yalies are admitted. Who cares and Chill out.
You do not know who is a celeb kid unless they choose to tell everyone else.
Because I am a junior and I want to apply there the next cycle
Hi Hot Mess Throwaway 7! Why do you care?
Which students go there?
You could also just Google them I guess
Since you want to beat around the bush I’ll just say it

Harvard is 💯 trash.

fys question!
people who’ve been in fys, i was wondering would i have enough time to go visit home on weekends? i’m a two hour drive away, but i’m not sure how busy they’d be keeping fys students.
thanks so much!
I can think of three weekends when they had things planned for us, and they were all really fun trips/activities. Otherwise your weekends will be pretty open so you probably could manage trips home.
thanks so much!
opinions/experiences of the first year scholars program?
trying to decide if it is worth the 7 weeks
https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/um1xan/has_anyone_here_done_the_first_year_scholars_at/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Here's a thread with much of the details discussed
If you don’t mind me asking, why don’t you like ENG 114? Why would it be a wasted credit? I’m just asking because I’m considering the program
I jumped straight into classes that I found more interesting. ENG 114 felt like I was just sorta taking an English class. I took 116 and regretted it.

As an example, I really got my writing boot camp in a religious studies class about pluralism and philosophy. 

That said, it also depends on your credit philosophy. I was a second semester senior who took six credits because I wanted every second's worth. 

Edit: Actually, lol, this whole time (it's been 16 years since freshmen year) I thought there was a maximum credit number. So as long as you aren't aiming for just 36, there's no tradeoff there. I will admit, part of my comment was forgetting that these classes wouldnt count against the recommended first semester total.
I've been involved in some alumni things for FYS. I think the other thread laid out a lot of the specifics and positive well. I don't think I would have personally done it as an undergrad - I have complicated feelings around identifying yourself around being first gen. 

The program has been historically aimed to support students that identify as FGLI. In general, folks tend to make fast friends with the first people the meet on campus and I'm glad that mine was a wider field of students. That said, I also acknowledge that I'm pretty weird - I grew up in deep south texas and so had a different orientation around race, class, and identity.

The program has been well built to support student's transition to Yale, so I think the question is whether you feel like you want that support (I also personally wwould not want to waste a credit on ENG 114, but that's a different convo).

What are some volunteering options for Yale kids?
Hey guys,

I was just wondering if anyone knew of any volunteering options in New Haven? I feel like I hear of them through the grapevine but have no idea how to actual get started with joining/membership. Does anyone know more about some options?
Dwight hall or some of the chaplaincy’s are your best bets for middle men on volunteering. They can serve as hubs connecting you to student groups and local nonprofits doing good work. Other than that just reaching out directly to places works, there’s multiple soup kitchens, food banks, and more.
The urban decay surrounding Yale makes it easy to find opportunities to serve people in need
E-scooters
It seems there many e-scooters being used around campus, especially up by science hill.   What do people do with them when they have to be inside a campus building (classroom, library, etc.)?  Do people carry scooters inside and keep them with them?  or do they lock them up at an exposed bike rack?  or do something like lock it up on a bike rack inside the gates of a nearby residential college?  Are there are any restrictions bringing them inside if you want to?
Any e-scooter users on campus out there?
Portuguese L1-3
Is Portuguese still relatively an easy language class? The course table reviews are still really great, but sometimes I know that those can be a little outdated lol. Has anyone taken it recently that can comment on it?
The Portuguese program at Yale is incredible. You can’t go wrong with any of the instructors. Seriously all great people and even better educators. The program is also really well endowed with a lot of cultural exposure opportunities. I’d say go for it.
Not a yalie myself, do you have any website recs on where I can check course reviews ?
what clothing brands are most common on campus?
i’m an incoming int’l so i’m not too sure what brands are common (both for normal outfits and for winterwear)
this is so helpful!! thank you so much!
Same as you, came to Yale and never seen snow before lol. The best advice I received for fall/winter clothing is to have jackets/coats/winterwear for every 10 degree difference in weather... i.e. 50 to 40, 40 to 30, 30 to 20. I came here during the summer so I just bought clothes here as it got colder. Got myself the classic bean boots from LL Bean for snow, some random down and puffy coats for every temperature as I mentioned, long nice coats for fall and spring. Don't forget your beanies and gloves. 

2nd best advice: LAYERS. Undershirt (I'm a girl, I have several Uniqlo undershirts), a nice warm top or sweater, another cardigan, thick coat. That's how I dressed almost everyday. Buildings and offices have heating so you'll want to easily remove your layers and feel comfy inside. 

3rd advice: The biggest issue with snow is it melts and you get wet. Wear waterproof when it's snowing. Invest on a nice winter boots. I loved my LL Bean immediately so that's the only one I have. 

4th: Always look at the weather app.

Oh i'm not a student so I don't know what brands to recommend in terms of everyday clothing. But in an office setting, no one cares as long as you look presentable lol.

Canada goose is like the supreme expensive jackets and I can't afford that. Perhaps you can, bunch of people own it cuz they're really warm and good quality. Uniqlo is the extreme end of extremely cheap but still works. North Face, Patagonia, Lululemon. You can check out REI stores too.

Hope this helps!
got it, thank you sm!
umm I’ve noticed a fair amount of Tommy Hilfiger around recently. And the wealthier kids wear Canada goose jackets in winter. Otherwise I don’t know of any specific brands that are worn
thank you so much!!
Patagonia, Columbia, LL Bean, North Face, Lululemon, Uniqlo, Vineyard Vines are all pretty common and are good bets. I would invest in a good pair of winter boots, a raincoat, a big winter coat, a thinner jacket, and some sweaters.

Grocery shops near campus
Close and cheap grocery shop recommendations near OC (aka not GHeav)
Not really any cheap ones besides maybe Stop&Shop toward Elm St. kinda near popeyes. All the rest are small and pricey like Elm City Market.
There's not really any close / cheap ones. On Chapel (towards State St station) there's Elm City that is normally slightly cheaper, and a Dollar store opposite that is significantly cheaper but lacks variety. Your best options are on Whalley, with the big stop&shop (there is another dollar store on the walk there also).
Nothing cheap at all. You can walk or take the Yale shuttle to stop n shop. There’s one to a further away Trader Joe’s too
Get a zipcar subscription and go to Aldi. If you’re a student there’s a discount
Stop & Shop is the go-to grocery store near campus for basically everybody who lives outside of the dorms. It's not super close to OC unfortunately but definitely within walking distance. Otherwise a shuttle goes to Trader Joe's on weekends.
Minoras Market on whalley. You can take a town bus or walk. Much cheaper than anything else. You can also take a city bus out to Walmart.
Has anyone here done the First Year Scholars at Yale (FSY) program?
title. Has anyone done the program before? It seems great but I feel like it’s a lot of added stress for what was supposed to be a super stress-free summer.. any thoughts? Did anyone like/dislike? Thanks :)!
Since you were being graded in the classes, how stressful was it? Were the professors more lenient since it was the summer? Did the majority of people get As in both of their classes (English and Math)?
thank you sm for the insight :)
Hmmm to me it was definitely stressful at times but a lot of it was very manageable. I think one of the great things that FSY does is to make sure that we are adequately supported throughout the summer, especially considering the various backgrounds that all of us are coming in with! My Professor always made sure to be readily available to meet during office hours and we are assigned a writing partner that is there to help us through the process and provide feedback. As far as I know, the majority of people did receive A's and the lowest I've heard of someone getting is a B. Overall, the professors are very understanding of things and will be there to support you :)
Hey, this may sound like a stupid question, but does Yale cover room and board too? Like did you have to pay for food or pay for a room?
Sorry for the late response, but yes! FSY is completely all expenses covered :)
Hey! I did FSY last summer and it was so amazing :D definitely helped me prepare a lot for Yale and you get to meet so many amazing people. In the end, I think it’s extremely worth it and you’ll make so many great memories considering it’s in person this year
[deleted]
Yeah, and most of the friend groups from my FSY cohort I still see hanging out together around campus! I was a more floaty person, but I’m still close with two of my FSY friends and I hang around a few others occasionally as well :)
I did FSY back in 2019 and it was the best way I could’ve spent my summer before first year! It really allowed me to be comfortable at yale as a FGLI student, and the 1.5 credits I got from it were super important to my later semesters (decreasing workload). Highly recommend!
the understanding i have of FSY through the first-years i’ve worked with is that, while FSY takes up part of your summer, it actually prepares you for the rigor you’ll experience at college. it’s a way to get ahead on credits so you can take it a bit easier your first year (and not worry if you need to drop a class or two) while acclimating you to the rigor at yale. it has the added benefit of providing social structure as well, where you are able to meet with a cohort of FGLI students and make friends prior to your first-year.

ninja edit: if it wasn’t clear, i would highly recommend doing it if you were invited to the program. i don’t think you would ever regret it.
this^
i don't think the class is that hard (at least my friends who did FSY describe doing very little work overall)
Thank you so much! This really was an insightful answer. I'm convinced that this would be a great opportunity, but I just have a few holdbacks.

1. Rigor. I'm not sure how rigorous the courses will be, which scares me as I would rather not start off my Yale academic career with a less than stellar start. Also, I'm not great at math and it's been a while since I've done real math work, so I'm worried about diving right back into headfirst this summer. On the flip side, it'd obviously help with the transition into Yale. As a side note, I don't know what major or path I want to pursue, so picking the right classes would be tough.

2. Friends. I think that FSY would provide me with a great opportunity to adjust socially and make good friends at Yale, but I also have my friends back home. This is essentially the last time I get to hang out with them for an extended period of time before we all head our separate ways, and to spend my entire summer at Yale would break my heart. I've been looking forward to this summer where'd I be relatively stress-free where I'd spend a ton of time with my friends, and going to FSY would obviously cap that.

3. Am I even guaranteed a spot? It seems more people were nominated than they have spots, so it'd be annoying if I were to accept my FSY offer only to find out I couldn't go. This isn't a real holdback tbh, just something that's crossed my mind lol.
FSY is meant to prepare you for college courses, and the class that you do take is not meant to be super hard. The idea is to give you a slow introduction to Yale, and make sure you have some credits to fall back on, in case you need to drop a class during your first or second semester.

I did not do FSY but I have many, many FGLI friends who did, and not one of them regrets it. They all had a beautiful time and consider it among their best Yale experiences---and also, they basically did no work the whole time. The FSY friendships are some of the longest-lasting at Yale. I would strongly strongly recommend doing it. PM me if you want more details or have more questions
That's encouraging! I'm a bit worried about math bc I haven't really done math in over a year, so I'm not sure diving headfirst into a math course would be a great idea.
Rigor — If you do not do FSY, you will be much more bombarded come the fall. FSY is meant to provide you the structure to combat the rigor that you’ll face here, not to be some absurdly difficult program. It will help you make connections with professors, people in the FGLI community, teach you better studying techniques, help you access tutoring resources, and much much more. If you are concerned about rigor in general, you are much better off attending FSY than not.

Friends - I can’t speak to this, other than to say that you will be very rewarded socially at FSY. Another commenter mentioned that FSY often leads to some of the longest-lasting friendships here, and from what I’ve seen/heard that is true. But if you feel that the best thing for you is to stay home and be with your friends, just do that. Speaking from the point of view of a college senior, what I have to say about that is a little callous but true — I only wish I had more time with the amazing people I’ve met here, and the people you’re meant to stay friends with from high school will stay your friends, regardless of a summer spent away. I understand though that as a high school senior I probably would have been concerned about the same thing as you.

Spot - No idea how this works, but I’m sure other FSY participants in this thread can speak to it :)
Well, you'll have to take a math class at Yale eventually, right? Might as well do it in the safest and most supportive possible environment!
Thank you so much! Genuinely very helpful! 

I heard that there was a website where I could review courses at Yale, to see how hard it was or what it's about with a review of the professor. If true, could you pass me the link so I could check out some of the FGY classes?
Does anybody know how difficult the courses are? I'm not sure how well prepared I am for strong rigor, especially considering how this summer was supposed to be the last one we had in a while where we were free and all
I think it is a great opportunity and Bulldog Days wasn’t immersive enough for me – I want to make connections and feel confident when first year begins so hopefully it’ll go great and it won’t be too stressful!
Can we choose the math courses? Like statistics etc Or is it only calc?
You take a placement test to get placed into calc 1, 2, 3, or statistics
Hi! I did FSY last summer and even though it was virtual, I still loved it! I took an ENGL 114 seminar on climate change and it was super interesting and engaging. My professor was quite lenient on due dates, especially when I had a death in my family. I also took the calc 2 class and although it was challenging, I felt supported by my professor and the TAs (super helpful!). FSY was definitely not easy for me, but I’m super grateful that I did it because it gave me a jumpstart on credits and adjusting to the rigor of college. I’m also still great friends with the people from my counselor group too!
This is super insightful and helpful, thank you!

Just a few questions:
1.) What's your background in math? I personally struggle a bit with math and it's been a while since I've done any, so I'm worried about going to FSY and struggling with it. Keep in mind I'm not sure what I want to major in and that I virtually have 0 experience with calc. Do you think I'll be able to keep up? Also, I'm not familiar with research papers. Did you mean 8 pages single spaced, 1.15 spaced, or double spaced?

2.) Is there any place where I can get more info/reviews on the courses being taught (both FSY and Yale courses in general)? I feel like it'd be helpful for me to know what I'm getting into. 

3.) What is WR? I'm not super familiar on the distribution requirements and the terminology that comes with it.

Thank you so much!!!
Hey I had a question. For FSY, do you stay at the Yale campus the entire length of the program or how does that work? Like can you leave on days you don’t have any schedule events?
1) I personally have a strong background in math and calc, but there's a placement test to sort into 3 levels of math. If it's the same as when I went, it's Statistics, Intro to Calc I, and Intro to Calc II. The math course was only half a credit, so it was pretty much just two lectures and a problem set a week then a final. There are sessions with ULAs (tutors for the course) every week to go over the problem set material, and you can work in groups on the problems, so you can reach out to your friends if you don't understand something.

Double-spaced 12 point, and by "research," I mean the kind where you check out a bunch of library books and cite some authors to make your points, not like actual primary investigation 

2). Your FSY info should have an overview of the curriculum, and beyond that, you can use the website "coursetable" to find descriptions, reviews, and difficulty ratings on courses, or you can check out courses.yale.edu for a class description and syllabus

3). Yale has a distribution system for graduation where courses may have an attached "distribution credit" that can count toward the total you'll need. 

You'll need 36 normal credits to graduate (as in, just make sure you get 4.5 courses a semester), but you'll need some of those to be "writing" courses, some to be "quantitative reasoning," etc. 

You can check all this stuff on your "Degree Audit" page on SIS, which I think you can access even if you have no declared major yet

Here's a breakdown: 

WR:  Writing courses. These are usually assigned on the basis of whether a course will make you write about 20 pages of material, so they can be in any subject. Most students need 2 WR credits to graduate. FSY has English 114, which will give you your first. I did my second in a history class junior year. These are often seminars, so they can be hard to get into and you want to make sure you like the subject. ("Seminar" meaning the class size will be limited to like 20 people whereas a lecture can have 300)

QR: Quantitative reasoning. I think you need 2? but I never paid attention to it. Any math course will give you one, but there are also some science courses that will. There are a few courses that kind of flub the designation that the humanities majors love to take to avoid much math. 

L: Language. There are specific intro language courses to take so you'll know them. Most people need 3 semesters of one, but if you place into a high level at the start then it's fewer. These classes are a pain and a half because they meet 5 days a week and have daily homework and class participation. Needs to be completed by the end of your junior year. You can take an online placement test before the start of the semester if you want to start at an intermediate level in a language, or you can start learning an entirely new language at L1. 

The others are more subject distribution than work-type distribution: 

Sc: Qualifies as a science class 

Soc: Qualifies as a social science class 

Hu: Qualifies as an arts & humanities class. 


They use these just to make sure you get enough exposure. Most courses will have a subject designation like that, but fewer courses satisfy the work-type ones above. You can use coursetable to filter courses by the type of distribution credits they have when you start to schedule your first semester.
You can leave at will, just be conscious that there are a lot of events and they'll get pissed if you miss any of them


I know a few kids went to NYC over weekends, and I stayed in an AirBnB with someone for a few days. 


You just also have a group counselor who'll check up on you if you're missing from one of the events, so you can't play hookey on anything
Is there a final for any math class that you would choose? Is there also a final for English, or is there just a final paper? (This is pertaining to FSY’s courses)
This was insanely helpful, thank you so much!! Definitely referring to this when selecting my courses this fall. 

This was supposed to be my last stress-free summer where I had no obligations and could hang out with my friends, and it seems like a real shame to give that up on such short notice given I've looked forward to this summer for many years now. In general, how manageable was FSY for you and your classmates in terms of workload and stress? As I stated earlier, I am worried about not being able to keep up in the math course...
Oh also, are we able to select which English class we want to attend? If so, is there a limit to each class? Or are we randomly assigned?
Thank you. Would you say the workload is difficult to manage if you’re not there as often. I’m only thinking of leaving on days where the schedule has no planned events.
Specifically for FSY, I believe the curriculum is set so that all attending students have the same workload and frequency. 


My year was a problem set every week, a final in math, and three papers to write, at like 5, 6, and 8 pages.
The maths courses literally won't be an issue. Everyone got the psets done pretty quickly. 


Writing essays in such a short time interval when your days are booked with activities from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in addition to daily class readings was hella crunch, but ultimately better to get that done when you have nothing else going on than to do it in your freshman year. 


FSY starts in like late June and ends a few weeks before school (unless you also want to join a Camp Yale program, which is advisable), so you'll still have like a month of summer to goof around with your friends. I remember having like a week of sleepovers with my buddies to get 100% completion on Spider-Man PS4 before I left.  


FSY is definitely about the most fun thing you can do with your summer. It's more work, but that work is also *engagement*, ya know? Like personally, I much preferred writing essays in the common room with my friends than what I would have been doing at home, which is sitting alone playing video games for 12 hours a day.  There's also an activity about every week, like water balloon fights or the ropes course and beach trip.
They're all the ENGL 114 *designation* because the workload and format is the same, but you'll get a choice between what the *subject* is.  


For example, in my year there were 6 classes taught by 6 professors. I opted for one that was about narrative structures, so we'd have to read excerpts about narrative elements and wrote an essay over the movie Memento. Other classes were about like, American agriculture and food deserts or immigration. There's a wide variety
You rank your top three (or that’s what happened in 2019) and most people I knew got their top choice (or second)
The workload will probably be the same to handle, but there aren't many days without planned events
Would you say it’s totally doable to get an A in both classes as long as you attend office hours and get the help you need?
I was genuinely 50/50 coming in here, but your consistent replies and unending advocacy has me leaning pretty heavily towards going. Thanks a ton!

Edit: but just in case this changes anything in terms of how manageable you think I'd find it, I have no real background in stats or calc. Like I couldn't solve a single integral or derivative...
I understand. Last question, do you stay in the regular dorms while you’re there and how does that work? Like how extensively do we need to pack?
I think most people got As in both classes
You'll probably go into the Intro to Calc I course, which shouldn't require any prior experience with it


Nobody has any prior experience with stats, but it's supposedly the "gut" math course (the one you take if you really need a math credit but you hate math)
You stay in the regular dorms. In my year, we all had rooms in Ezra Stiles. Generally there will also be summer session srudents on campus. 


Definitely pack minimally. Not worth it at all to decorate your dorm because 1. you won't be there often 2. time flies 3. it's not going to be your freshman year dorm.


Essentially all you really need are stuff like bedsheets, towels, shower caddy, laundry bag, swimsuit, athletic wear, etc. You'll want a fan, but it's better to just get one in New Haven than try to pack one. You'll need paper and pencil and whatever you need to organize it (like a binder), which you can either pack or get from Family Dollar or Stop & Shop pretty easily. 


They should provide a list of everything you might need to remember to pack, but a lot of it will be pretty superfluous
I’m planning on taking Calc 2 if I attend. If you took it, do you have any thoughts on the class or pieces of advice for it? Thank you for the quick responses btw. It’s extremely helpful
LMAO, I'm prolly gonna be one of those people you mentioned earlier who attempts to take QR classes that aren't even math lol

Any advice on whether I should pursue stats or calc 1?
Thank you so much, helped a lot
I recall the course being almost entirely focused on summation series and Taylor approximations


It may be helpful to review the notation for a discrete summation series


Just make sure to take notes in class and try to work on the psets as a group. Also, you'll have to scan in your work, which can be done at most of the Yale printing locations, so be on the lookout for the big black scanner-printer machines
Intro Calc I would probably be the best if you plan to take Calc I at all in your undergraduate career, but it is very much heavy on modeling word problems and such


I don't know much about stats-- I think the full semester course incorporates Python programming, but I don't recall that being a part of the summer intro. I believe that class was more number crunchy in the psets-- like, the math is easy but tedious, whereas in the other classes, the math is a little complex to think about but not too many calculations


This is entirely variable based on the year, but location could be a factor. In my year, the calc classes were in the Poorvu center of Sterling Library (a five minute walk from our dorms in Ezra Stiles), whereas the S&DS kids had class on Science Hill (~20-30 minute walk) and they hated that
Once again, thank you! Not to be cheesy, but I genuinely believe that people like u who are so helpful and kind (towards a complete stranger on the internet in need of help) are what makes Yale Yale. Greatly appreciated
I did FSY 2019


It's a must-go if you get the invite: you really don't want to miss out. 

They keep your schedule booked with deans and advisors to meet,  which is what added stress for me, but there are also a lot of structured fun days (like ropes course plus the beach). 


The classes are only stressful in that they'll be your first Yale courses. The curriculum is only 1.5 credits (compared to an average of 4--5 credits a semester). They also significantly shorten the workload (our final research paper was only like an 8 page requirement) because of the timeframe. 


Meeting 75 people and getting to know campus before the start of your freshman year is an incredible headstart. 


Also, keep in mind that this is essentially free summer school, which opens up your schedule for the later years. Only needing to take 1 more WR credit class after FSY was amazing.
Hmmm to me it was definitely stressful at times but a lot of it was very manageable. I think one of the great things that FSY does is to make sure that we are adequately supported throughout the summer, especially considering the various backgrounds that all of us are coming in with! My Professor always made sure to be readily available to meet during office hours and we are assigned a writing partner that is there to help us through the process and provide feedback. As far as I know, the majority of people did receive A's and the lowest I've heard of someone getting is a B. Overall, the professors are very understanding of things and will be there to support you :)
Hey, this may sound like a stupid question, but does Yale cover room and board too? Like did you have to pay for food or pay for a room?
Sorry for the late response, but yes! FSY is completely all expenses covered :)
Since you were being graded in the classes, how stressful was it? Were the professors more lenient since it was the summer? Did the majority of people get As in both of their classes (English and Math)?
thank you sm for the insight :)
Yeah, and most of the friend groups from my FSY cohort I still see hanging out together around campus! I was a more floaty person, but I’m still close with two of my FSY friends and I hang around a few others occasionally as well :)

Thank you so much! This really was an insightful answer. I'm convinced that this would be a great opportunity, but I just have a few holdbacks.

1. Rigor. I'm not sure how rigorous the courses will be, which scares me as I would rather not start off my Yale academic career with a less than stellar start. Also, I'm not great at math and it's been a while since I've done real math work, so I'm worried about diving right back into headfirst this summer. On the flip side, it'd obviously help with the transition into Yale. As a side note, I don't know what major or path I want to pursue, so picking the right classes would be tough.

2. Friends. I think that FSY would provide me with a great opportunity to adjust socially and make good friends at Yale, but I also have my friends back home. This is essentially the last time I get to hang out with them for an extended period of time before we all head our separate ways, and to spend my entire summer at Yale would break my heart. I've been looking forward to this summer where'd I be relatively stress-free where I'd spend a ton of time with my friends, and going to FSY would obviously cap that.

3. Am I even guaranteed a spot? It seems more people were nominated than they have spots, so it'd be annoying if I were to accept my FSY offer only to find out I couldn't go. This isn't a real holdback tbh, just something that's crossed my mind lol.
Rigor — If you do not do FSY, you will be much more bombarded come the fall. FSY is meant to provide you the structure to combat the rigor that you’ll face here, not to be some absurdly difficult program. It will help you make connections with professors, people in the FGLI community, teach you better studying techniques, help you access tutoring resources, and much much more. If you are concerned about rigor in general, you are much better off attending FSY than not.

Friends - I can’t speak to this, other than to say that you will be very rewarded socially at FSY. Another commenter mentioned that FSY often leads to some of the longest-lasting friendships here, and from what I’ve seen/heard that is true. But if you feel that the best thing for you is to stay home and be with your friends, just do that. Speaking from the point of view of a college senior, what I have to say about that is a little callous but true — I only wish I had more time with the amazing people I’ve met here, and the people you’re meant to stay friends with from high school will stay your friends, regardless of a summer spent away. I understand though that as a high school senior I probably would have been concerned about the same thing as you.

Spot - No idea how this works, but I’m sure other FSY participants in this thread can speak to it :)
Thank you so much! Genuinely very helpful! 

I heard that there was a website where I could review courses at Yale, to see how hard it was or what it's about with a review of the professor. If true, could you pass me the link so I could check out some of the FGY classes?
the understanding i have of FSY through the first-years i’ve worked with is that, while FSY takes up part of your summer, it actually prepares you for the rigor you’ll experience at college. it’s a way to get ahead on credits so you can take it a bit easier your first year (and not worry if you need to drop a class or two) while acclimating you to the rigor at yale. it has the added benefit of providing social structure as well, where you are able to meet with a cohort of FGLI students and make friends prior to your first-year.

ninja edit: if it wasn’t clear, i would highly recommend doing it if you were invited to the program. i don’t think you would ever regret it.
FSY is meant to prepare you for college courses, and the class that you do take is not meant to be super hard. The idea is to give you a slow introduction to Yale, and make sure you have some credits to fall back on, in case you need to drop a class during your first or second semester.

I did not do FSY but I have many, many FGLI friends who did, and not one of them regrets it. They all had a beautiful time and consider it among their best Yale experiences---and also, they basically did no work the whole time. The FSY friendships are some of the longest-lasting at Yale. I would strongly strongly recommend doing it. PM me if you want more details or have more questions
this^
That's encouraging! I'm a bit worried about math bc I haven't really done math in over a year, so I'm not sure diving headfirst into a math course would be a great idea.
Well, you'll have to take a math class at Yale eventually, right? Might as well do it in the safest and most supportive possible environment!
i don't think the class is that hard (at least my friends who did FSY describe doing very little work overall)
You take a placement test to get placed into calc 1, 2, 3, or statistics
Can we choose the math courses? Like statistics etc Or is it only calc?
1) I personally have a strong background in math and calc, but there's a placement test to sort into 3 levels of math. If it's the same as when I went, it's Statistics, Intro to Calc I, and Intro to Calc II. The math course was only half a credit, so it was pretty much just two lectures and a problem set a week then a final. There are sessions with ULAs (tutors for the course) every week to go over the problem set material, and you can work in groups on the problems, so you can reach out to your friends if you don't understand something.

Double-spaced 12 point, and by "research," I mean the kind where you check out a bunch of library books and cite some authors to make your points, not like actual primary investigation 

2). Your FSY info should have an overview of the curriculum, and beyond that, you can use the website "coursetable" to find descriptions, reviews, and difficulty ratings on courses, or you can check out courses.yale.edu for a class description and syllabus

3). Yale has a distribution system for graduation where courses may have an attached "distribution credit" that can count toward the total you'll need. 

You'll need 36 normal credits to graduate (as in, just make sure you get 4.5 courses a semester), but you'll need some of those to be "writing" courses, some to be "quantitative reasoning," etc. 

You can check all this stuff on your "Degree Audit" page on SIS, which I think you can access even if you have no declared major yet

Here's a breakdown: 

WR:  Writing courses. These are usually assigned on the basis of whether a course will make you write about 20 pages of material, so they can be in any subject. Most students need 2 WR credits to graduate. FSY has English 114, which will give you your first. I did my second in a history class junior year. These are often seminars, so they can be hard to get into and you want to make sure you like the subject. ("Seminar" meaning the class size will be limited to like 20 people whereas a lecture can have 300)

QR: Quantitative reasoning. I think you need 2? but I never paid attention to it. Any math course will give you one, but there are also some science courses that will. There are a few courses that kind of flub the designation that the humanities majors love to take to avoid much math. 

L: Language. There are specific intro language courses to take so you'll know them. Most people need 3 semesters of one, but if you place into a high level at the start then it's fewer. These classes are a pain and a half because they meet 5 days a week and have daily homework and class participation. Needs to be completed by the end of your junior year. You can take an online placement test before the start of the semester if you want to start at an intermediate level in a language, or you can start learning an entirely new language at L1. 

The others are more subject distribution than work-type distribution: 

Sc: Qualifies as a science class 

Soc: Qualifies as a social science class 

Hu: Qualifies as an arts & humanities class. 


They use these just to make sure you get enough exposure. Most courses will have a subject designation like that, but fewer courses satisfy the work-type ones above. You can use coursetable to filter courses by the type of distribution credits they have when you start to schedule your first semester.
Is there a final for any math class that you would choose? Is there also a final for English, or is there just a final paper? (This is pertaining to FSY’s courses)
This was insanely helpful, thank you so much!! Definitely referring to this when selecting my courses this fall. 

This was supposed to be my last stress-free summer where I had no obligations and could hang out with my friends, and it seems like a real shame to give that up on such short notice given I've looked forward to this summer for many years now. In general, how manageable was FSY for you and your classmates in terms of workload and stress? As I stated earlier, I am worried about not being able to keep up in the math course...
Oh also, are we able to select which English class we want to attend? If so, is there a limit to each class? Or are we randomly assigned?
Specifically for FSY, I believe the curriculum is set so that all attending students have the same workload and frequency. 


My year was a problem set every week, a final in math, and three papers to write, at like 5, 6, and 8 pages.
The maths courses literally won't be an issue. Everyone got the psets done pretty quickly. 


Writing essays in such a short time interval when your days are booked with activities from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in addition to daily class readings was hella crunch, but ultimately better to get that done when you have nothing else going on than to do it in your freshman year. 


FSY starts in like late June and ends a few weeks before school (unless you also want to join a Camp Yale program, which is advisable), so you'll still have like a month of summer to goof around with your friends. I remember having like a week of sleepovers with my buddies to get 100% completion on Spider-Man PS4 before I left.  


FSY is definitely about the most fun thing you can do with your summer. It's more work, but that work is also *engagement*, ya know? Like personally, I much preferred writing essays in the common room with my friends than what I would have been doing at home, which is sitting alone playing video games for 12 hours a day.  There's also an activity about every week, like water balloon fights or the ropes course and beach trip.
They're all the ENGL 114 *designation* because the workload and format is the same, but you'll get a choice between what the *subject* is.  


For example, in my year there were 6 classes taught by 6 professors. I opted for one that was about narrative structures, so we'd have to read excerpts about narrative elements and wrote an essay over the movie Memento. Other classes were about like, American agriculture and food deserts or immigration. There's a wide variety
You rank your top three (or that’s what happened in 2019) and most people I knew got their top choice (or second)
Would you say it’s totally doable to get an A in both classes as long as you attend office hours and get the help you need?
I was genuinely 50/50 coming in here, but your consistent replies and unending advocacy has me leaning pretty heavily towards going. Thanks a ton!

Edit: but just in case this changes anything in terms of how manageable you think I'd find it, I have no real background in stats or calc. Like I couldn't solve a single integral or derivative...
I think most people got As in both classes
You'll probably go into the Intro to Calc I course, which shouldn't require any prior experience with it


Nobody has any prior experience with stats, but it's supposedly the "gut" math course (the one you take if you really need a math credit but you hate math)
I’m planning on taking Calc 2 if I attend. If you took it, do you have any thoughts on the class or pieces of advice for it? Thank you for the quick responses btw. It’s extremely helpful
LMAO, I'm prolly gonna be one of those people you mentioned earlier who attempts to take QR classes that aren't even math lol

Any advice on whether I should pursue stats or calc 1?
I recall the course being almost entirely focused on summation series and Taylor approximations


It may be helpful to review the notation for a discrete summation series


Just make sure to take notes in class and try to work on the psets as a group. Also, you'll have to scan in your work, which can be done at most of the Yale printing locations, so be on the lookout for the big black scanner-printer machines
Intro Calc I would probably be the best if you plan to take Calc I at all in your undergraduate career, but it is very much heavy on modeling word problems and such

This is super insightful and helpful, thank you!

Just a few questions:
1.) What's your background in math? I personally struggle a bit with math and it's been a while since I've done any, so I'm worried about going to FSY and struggling with it. Keep in mind I'm not sure what I want to major in and that I virtually have 0 experience with calc. Do you think I'll be able to keep up? Also, I'm not familiar with research papers. Did you mean 8 pages single spaced, 1.15 spaced, or double spaced?

2.) Is there any place where I can get more info/reviews on the courses being taught (both FSY and Yale courses in general)? I feel like it'd be helpful for me to know what I'm getting into. 

3.) What is WR? I'm not super familiar on the distribution requirements and the terminology that comes with it.

Thank you so much!!!
You can leave at will, just be conscious that there are a lot of events and they'll get pissed if you miss any of them


I know a few kids went to NYC over weekends, and I stayed in an AirBnB with someone for a few days. 


You just also have a group counselor who'll check up on you if you're missing from one of the events, so you can't play hookey on anything
Thank you. Would you say the workload is difficult to manage if you’re not there as often. I’m only thinking of leaving on days where the schedule has no planned events.
The workload will probably be the same to handle, but there aren't many days without planned events
I understand. Last question, do you stay in the regular dorms while you’re there and how does that work? Like how extensively do we need to pack?
You stay in the regular dorms. In my year, we all had rooms in Ezra Stiles. Generally there will also be summer session srudents on campus. 


Definitely pack minimally. Not worth it at all to decorate your dorm because 1. you won't be there often 2. time flies 3. it's not going to be your freshman year dorm.


Essentially all you really need are stuff like bedsheets, towels, shower caddy, laundry bag, swimsuit, athletic wear, etc. You'll want a fan, but it's better to just get one in New Haven than try to pack one. You'll need paper and pencil and whatever you need to organize it (like a binder), which you can either pack or get from Family Dollar or Stop & Shop pretty easily. 


They should provide a list of everything you might need to remember to pack, but a lot of it will be pretty superfluous
Thank you so much, helped a lot
Hey I had a question. For FSY, do you stay at the Yale campus the entire length of the program or how does that work? Like can you leave on days you don’t have any schedule events?
Hey, this may sound like a stupid question, but does Yale cover room and board too? Like did you have to pay for food or pay for a room?

Thank you. Would you say the workload is difficult to manage if you’re not there as often. I’m only thinking of leaving on days where the schedule has no planned events.
The workload will probably be the same to handle, but there aren't many days without planned events
I understand. Last question, do you stay in the regular dorms while you’re there and how does that work? Like how extensively do we need to pack?
You stay in the regular dorms. In my year, we all had rooms in Ezra Stiles. Generally there will also be summer session srudents on campus. 


Definitely pack minimally. Not worth it at all to decorate your dorm because 1. you won't be there often 2. time flies 3. it's not going to be your freshman year dorm.


Essentially all you really need are stuff like bedsheets, towels, shower caddy, laundry bag, swimsuit, athletic wear, etc. You'll want a fan, but it's better to just get one in New Haven than try to pack one. You'll need paper and pencil and whatever you need to organize it (like a binder), which you can either pack or get from Family Dollar or Stop & Shop pretty easily. 


They should provide a list of everything you might need to remember to pack, but a lot of it will be pretty superfluous
Thank you so much, helped a lot
You can leave at will, just be conscious that there are a lot of events and they'll get pissed if you miss any of them


I know a few kids went to NYC over weekends, and I stayed in an AirBnB with someone for a few days. 


You just also have a group counselor who'll check up on you if you're missing from one of the events, so you can't play hookey on anything
Sorry for the late response, but yes! FSY is completely all expenses covered :)
Hey, this may sound like a stupid question, but does Yale cover room and board too? Like did you have to pay for food or pay for a room?
Thank you so much! Genuinely very helpful! 

I heard that there was a website where I could review courses at Yale, to see how hard it was or what it's about with a review of the professor. If true, could you pass me the link so I could check out some of the FGY classes?
Rigor — If you do not do FSY, you will be much more bombarded come the fall. FSY is meant to provide you the structure to combat the rigor that you’ll face here, not to be some absurdly difficult program. It will help you make connections with professors, people in the FGLI community, teach you better studying techniques, help you access tutoring resources, and much much more. If you are concerned about rigor in general, you are much better off attending FSY than not.

Friends - I can’t speak to this, other than to say that you will be very rewarded socially at FSY. Another commenter mentioned that FSY often leads to some of the longest-lasting friendships here, and from what I’ve seen/heard that is true. But if you feel that the best thing for you is to stay home and be with your friends, just do that. Speaking from the point of view of a college senior, what I have to say about that is a little callous but true — I only wish I had more time with the amazing people I’ve met here, and the people you’re meant to stay friends with from high school will stay your friends, regardless of a summer spent away. I understand though that as a high school senior I probably would have been concerned about the same thing as you.

Spot - No idea how this works, but I’m sure other FSY participants in this thread can speak to it :)
Well, you'll have to take a math class at Yale eventually, right? Might as well do it in the safest and most supportive possible environment!
Specifically for FSY, I believe the curriculum is set so that all attending students have the same workload and frequency. 


My year was a problem set every week, a final in math, and three papers to write, at like 5, 6, and 8 pages.
Would you say it’s totally doable to get an A in both classes as long as you attend office hours and get the help you need?
I think most people got As in both classes
I’m planning on taking Calc 2 if I attend. If you took it, do you have any thoughts on the class or pieces of advice for it? Thank you for the quick responses btw. It’s extremely helpful
I recall the course being almost entirely focused on summation series and Taylor approximations


It may be helpful to review the notation for a discrete summation series


Just make sure to take notes in class and try to work on the psets as a group. Also, you'll have to scan in your work, which can be done at most of the Yale printing locations, so be on the lookout for the big black scanner-printer machines
Is there a final for any math class that you would choose? Is there also a final for English, or is there just a final paper? (This is pertaining to FSY’s courses)
The maths courses literally won't be an issue. Everyone got the psets done pretty quickly. 


Writing essays in such a short time interval when your days are booked with activities from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in addition to daily class readings was hella crunch, but ultimately better to get that done when you have nothing else going on than to do it in your freshman year. 


FSY starts in like late June and ends a few weeks before school (unless you also want to join a Camp Yale program, which is advisable), so you'll still have like a month of summer to goof around with your friends. I remember having like a week of sleepovers with my buddies to get 100% completion on Spider-Man PS4 before I left.  


FSY is definitely about the most fun thing you can do with your summer. It's more work, but that work is also *engagement*, ya know? Like personally, I much preferred writing essays in the common room with my friends than what I would have been doing at home, which is sitting alone playing video games for 12 hours a day.  There's also an activity about every week, like water balloon fights or the ropes course and beach trip.
I was genuinely 50/50 coming in here, but your consistent replies and unending advocacy has me leaning pretty heavily towards going. Thanks a ton!

Edit: but just in case this changes anything in terms of how manageable you think I'd find it, I have no real background in stats or calc. Like I couldn't solve a single integral or derivative...
You'll probably go into the Intro to Calc I course, which shouldn't require any prior experience with it


Nobody has any prior experience with stats, but it's supposedly the "gut" math course (the one you take if you really need a math credit but you hate math)
LMAO, I'm prolly gonna be one of those people you mentioned earlier who attempts to take QR classes that aren't even math lol

Any advice on whether I should pursue stats or calc 1?
Intro Calc I would probably be the best if you plan to take Calc I at all in your undergraduate career, but it is very much heavy on modeling word problems and such


I don't know much about stats-- I think the full semester course incorporates Python programming, but I don't recall that being a part of the summer intro. I believe that class was more number crunchy in the psets-- like, the math is easy but tedious, whereas in the other classes, the math is a little complex to think about but not too many calculations


This is entirely variable based on the year, but location could be a factor. In my year, the calc classes were in the Poorvu center of Sterling Library (a five minute walk from our dorms in Ezra Stiles), whereas the S&DS kids had class on Science Hill (~20-30 minute walk) and they hated that
Once again, thank you! Not to be cheesy, but I genuinely believe that people like u who are so helpful and kind (towards a complete stranger on the internet in need of help) are what makes Yale Yale. Greatly appreciated
This was insanely helpful, thank you so much!! Definitely referring to this when selecting my courses this fall. 

This was supposed to be my last stress-free summer where I had no obligations and could hang out with my friends, and it seems like a real shame to give that up on such short notice given I've looked forward to this summer for many years now. In general, how manageable was FSY for you and your classmates in terms of workload and stress? As I stated earlier, I am worried about not being able to keep up in the math course...
They're all the ENGL 114 *designation* because the workload and format is the same, but you'll get a choice between what the *subject* is.  


For example, in my year there were 6 classes taught by 6 professors. I opted for one that was about narrative structures, so we'd have to read excerpts about narrative elements and wrote an essay over the movie Memento. Other classes were about like, American agriculture and food deserts or immigration. There's a wide variety
You rank your top three (or that’s what happened in 2019) and most people I knew got their top choice (or second)
Oh also, are we able to select which English class we want to attend? If so, is there a limit to each class? Or are we randomly assigned?
The workload will probably be the same to handle, but there aren't many days without planned events
I understand. Last question, do you stay in the regular dorms while you’re there and how does that work? Like how extensively do we need to pack?

School of art mfa students! Which college or univ did you get the bachelor degrees from?
Hi:)

I’m an illustration major student from RISD (bfa) and I wish I could go to yale for mfa (either painting or gd). But wondering which school did yale students get ba or bfa before yale?
what’s (in your opinion) the best orientation program?
i’ve heard that FOOT is the best but i’m super unfit lol so i’m considering the base camp trips — are those good/ a waste of time? my main priority is coming out of orientation w a group of friends, so any advice is appreciated!
bump, some of my best friends at Yale have been those I met at OIS
got it! thanks so much :)
Have you ever lived outside the US (even briefly)? Then OIS is by far the best. But don't worry too much about preorientation programs. Most friend groups from preorientation don't last even the first few months.
got it, thank you!
honestly, all of them are great. foot is a tight knit group if you go on to become a “foot leader” in future years, but i wouldn’t worry about friends on any pre-orientation trip.

harvest & focus are both great programs. choose whatever you’re most interested in doing, not what you think will gain you the most friends.
MOPs
Wait, what's the difference? It is still happening in Aug 21-31 right?
Orientation/first year arrival is the 21st and classes start 31. Mid/pre orientation programs are 24-27. This means they are in the middle and are required instead of happening before orientation with first years arriving at different times like in the past. This year everyone arrives at once and has some stuff before the programs start.
Ohh ok ok thanks!
P.S: They aren't pre-orientation this year, they are mid-orientation!
thanks for the tip! am leaning towards foot rn!
Foot literally changed my life. I was a nerdy kid from Ohio who had never really experienced the natural world. It planted the seed and now a large part of my life revolves around the outdoors. You’ll definitely make great friends, I still keep in touch with the people from my trip
thanks for the comment! def leaning towards foot
FOOT is amazing. It is a great opportunity to meet cool people. The hiking aspect is only part of it so your preparation is less important; you’ll be on a trip you’re ready for. It is also fun to just go elsewhere for a few days. Also the people are sick - a foot leader.
ooh got it! thank you sm!!
Do foot! No experience/fitness level required. I have friends who lead base camp trips and rave about how much fun they are. Agree with what others said that most pre-orientation friend groups don't stay close, although some people are still great friends with others from their foot groups and having those initial friends makes the first couple weeks at Yale way easier.
bump, some of my best friends at Yale have been those I met at OIS

AP Scores
Class of 26 and was wondering if Yale will rescind for 1s and 2s on ap tests?
Of course not. How do you think legacy admits enroll year after year?
I don’t think I even reported my senior year AP test scores.
No
I got 1s and 2s on all of my AP tests both junior and senior year of high school. I don't think Yale cared in the slightest.
Don't know how much it's changed, but 20 years ago they didn't care at all. Frankly, there wasn't much advantage to AP tests at Yale unless you were absolutely convinced you wanted to graduate early.
Eli Whitney Program
Hello everyone! I'm a non-traditional student and finished my high-school in 2016 but didn't go to college because i was fighting a mental illness. 
I'm currently in medschool( here in Brazil you get  in directly and the course takes 6 years to complete) and just finish my first semester with 4.7 GPA( that puts me in top 1 of my class) and i also do voluntary work helping people that are fighting a similar problem than I did.
My question is: does my profile fits the one that Eli Whitney Program is looking for?
I understand that the admission is complex and need more information than the ones I gave, but, maybe, you  folks can give me some insight or any advice about this subject. 
Ps: I didn't find the admission megathread, only the admitted one. Unfortunately that's not my case yet. If that's the wrong place do put my question, please show me the right one and I will delete the post.
This is actually not true. They accept individuals with a five or more year gap in their education, but very much prefer students who have recent course work and excellent grades. What they do not want is someone that already has a bachelor's degree.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure how the process works in Brazil, but if you're already in med school, I would assume you've had some education before that.

Yeah you right, I haven't looked at it in a while.

Op please read what they posted.
Early Career Development Program IT. Reviews???!
I was wondering if anyone has done this program… it’s a 18 month rotational program & I was looking for more information from ppl who have completed the program // ppl who know of it. I tried to look online but couldn’t find any reviews. I’m just curious as to how other’s felt this program was to them // if the program made an impact to their CS career. 

<currently studying my masters in cs>
can someone explain LEO
Disclaimer I go to school in Miami and couldn’t figure out if Leo was a frat
It's a frat, it's basically just a renamed SAE
Help Finding a Silliman Plate
Hello I’m looking for a Silliman plate from before they went to the common plate. Here is a picture of one https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/170094. I know they sold them here http://www.yale.edu/dining/options/yale_plates_order.html. However they no longer sell them there. So I’m hoping there is another place I can get one. If you know where to look it would be much appreciated. Thanks!
Thanks I’ll check it out
I’m pretty sure they used to sell them at Campus Customs if you’re anywhere near campus or will. Granted, the last time I was in campus customs was a couple of years ago.
You can check ebay - there's none there now but I know other colleges' plates show up there occasionally
I think the best ways are to look on etsy, ebay and I have also bought plates from this site: [Yale Memorabilia](https://www.collectableivy.com/yale-university-memorabilia-and-collectibles/)
Thanks I’ll check it out
What are your favorite things about Yale that you can't find out with a google search?

The left window views on the seventh floor in the stacks of the Sterling Library
But if I post it here, then someone could find it with a google search, soooooo
Steam pipes in the tunnels labeled “Brown sauce” with arrows toward dining halls.
Pwg 5th floor window the left staircase IYKYK
The Linonia and Brothers room. Like a childhood Borders, but better. (It's the novels room in SML)
Housing
Moving to New Haven for residency training at the end of June/early July. Never lived outside of Florida. Any recommendations on how to find off campus housing in New Haven?
There's a bunch of apartment buildings within walking distance of YNHH, and there's a bunch of grad students renting 1- or 2-family homes in East Rock. 

But overall, the answer is apartments.com or something like that.

What is residency training
If your training is in connection with Yale, definitely check out the Yale Off-Campus Housing: Rentals, sublets, roommates, furniture Facebook group
so many people from Florida... can we make a support group for the cold weather?

intl student has a few questions
hi! im a dutch high school student planning to apply to yale next fall, but since i cant visit the campus and ask a few questions that i have i thought id ask them here :) some can probably only be answered by other international students but ill just list them all:

- can i get 7 hours of sleep every night and still stay on top of my schoolwork, extracurriculars and possibly a job? im probably gonna major in english or wgss and im planning to apply to the education studies program :)
- is it smart for an international student to apply early action? because yale is my absolute dream school and id like to have my college applications out of the way before i start preparing for my final exams (im also applying early action to a dutch university) but i heard universities often defer international students anyway because they want to be able to compare everyone in the pool
- if i use they/them pronouns, will that be respected? and generally how accepting are yale students & faculty towards queer students?
- what types of activities would i do during the international students pre-orientation thingy & would i already be able to live in my suite?
- are the astronomy courses that prerequire "knowledge of elementary algebra" hard? im definitely not a stem person anymore but i had an astronomy obsession when i was 12 so i thought id fulfill the science requirements that way, but because of the dutch high school system i wont have had any physics classes for the last three years when i go to yale (i will have the said knowledge of elementary algebra though)
- this question needs to be asked so that i have a counter argument to tell my mum: do yale students fly a lot? (as in by airplane) because my mum thinks ill be surrounded by people who fly like 8 times a year and dont really think about the environmental consequences of flying (which i do, a lot) while i think most yale students would be smart enough to not fly that much anyway that is sort of a discussion weve been having
- this last question may require a bit more explanation lmao but here we go: in 2019 i went to the west coast of the usa and one thing that really bothered me was how much sugar americans put in pretty much everything (bread, tomato sauce, you name it, there was sugar in it). now my question is, is this also the case in yales dining halls? because ive seen those "what i eat in a day" videos on youtube but obviously when someone says "i had pasta" i cant really know whether the pasta was sugary or not lmao (i guess my questions is just "what do international students think of the food in yales dining halls")
thank you!!
* Yes but it depends on how much time you want to spend on your extracurriculars, how many courses you decide to take, how hard you party, etc.
* I have no advice there, I'm from the US
* As some straight white guy, note that these are just my observations, but: The Yale student body is very diverse, very accepting, and very, very LGBT. If someone addresses you incorrectly it's probably accidental and they'll have no problem with you correcting them. However, there will always be some small minority still stuck in the past; I have heard some... unwelcoming conversations between people who thought nobody was listening. For faculty I have no idea, my perspective again is limited.
* No clue, am domestic
* You'll probably be fine. If you aren't at first, you can go to office hours and re-learn what you need, and then you'll definitely be alright.
* I'm sure some do. I know some of the more well-off students travel frequently and I have no doubt much of it is by flying, especially during the year, outside of breaks. But overall I think Yale has a much greener student population than most colleges. Most flying, both out of time and cost, is probably out of necessity. To get home, I have to take a couple airplanes, but if you're close to home at Yale/want to visit somewhere nearby the train is at worst several blocks away and you can take it through all the major cities along the coast. Amtrak is not as regional as NS.
* Good question. While I can't speak to the food from an international standpoint, I can say that it's definitely healthier than what most Americans eat; I lost weight over the first few months I was on campus. You definitely will have instances where there's a lot of sugar, though -- the ketchup is always going to be very sugary, you have access to soda (and ice cream/soft serve, depending on the dining hall), there's desserts, I'm sure there's more. But it is not hard to eat healthy, especially if you like broccoli and asparagus :) For a better breakdown of day-to-day meals, I recommend downloading the Yale Dining app and looking at what there is from day to day during the school year. Now might not be a great time because finals are going on and there's all sorts of events happening.

I know that I can't really answer everything, but I hope this gets some of your bases covered. I'm just writing to get some info on your post in case nobody else provides anything substantive.
thank you!!
Yale allows students who apply for EA to apply to other schools - *just not other private schools.* At least, this is how it was in 2020-2021. Check the website or email an admissions counselor. You will also know by early-mid December if you get accepted. Since many other private colleges in the U.S. have application deadlines in January/February or even later than that, you can still apply to many other places if you don't get accepted. What I would do is fill out all of the applications early since you like to get things taken care of, but don't submit them until you get your decision from Yale. Good luck.
thank you!! i'll probably have to take at least 4 flights a year myself as well (we dont celebrate thanksgiving in the netherlands), but i just wanted to make sure people dont just hop on and off planes the way my mum thinks they do lmao
Just my two cents as a Yale grad currently studying in the UK. In my experience Europeans fly much more often than Americans. Flights are substantially more expensive in the US. There are no €15 Ryanair flights. Most Americans who fly do so for distances that are impractical to cover by other forms of transport. If you wanted to go to Chicago or the West coast you would fly, but in the Northeast intercity trains are common.
some things i can answer, i’m not international so i won’t speak for international students:

the students are very accepting of they/them identities — yale is colloquially known as the “gay ivy,” which is really a catch-all for a very lgbtq+ inclined student body. as for the faculty, yes, most of them tend to be accepting. as in any university, you may find an asshole or two amongst some older stuck-in-their-ways professors, but especially if you’re a wgss major or even in edstudies you won’t have any issue.

i know little of the oiss (for international students, pre-orientation) social scene, but i do know they help you set up things like getting an american bank account and phone number. it’s very practical and from what i’ve heard from my international friends, very useful. you most likely will move immediately into your suite, as pre-orientation is now required for everyone.

as for the sugar thing….it doesn’t feel like the dining hall uses much sugar? i’m american so that’s hard to gauge. you definitely won’t like the desserts but as for the main courses, many of them are not sweet at all. the pesto pasta for example definitely does not have sugar; i avoid tomato sauce so i can’t comment on that.


as for flying, yes? we do fly a lot, but i think that’s mainly a function of living in the united states. yale is in the northeast so almost all of the northeastern students take trains home (the northeast has a much better train system than other regions) and we take trains to travel into nyc, but many of us are from the midwest or the west coast and it’s easiest to take a flight home. for example, i’m from around chicago — if i chose to take a train, it would take me 2 hours to get into nyc, and then another 19 hours to take the direct train to chicago (and this is only one-way). a 2 hour flight is more manageable with yale’s academic schedule. by that virtue, many of us are taking about -6 necessary flights per academic year (2 for thanksgiving break, 2 for winter break, and 2 for summer break), in addition to any class traveling (field trips to florida, etc etc) or conferences we attend.
thank you!!

Doing research at Yale over the summer, looking for friends
What's up guys. I'm a student at Emory coming to Yale this summer for some chemistry research. I don't really know much about Yale/New Haven but I'm hoping to meet some cool people and make some good friends this summer.

I'm 20M, studying Applied Math/Stats. I'm into math, guitar, olympic weightlifting (also curious about what gyms are nearby), filming/edits, drifting, history, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm decently outgoing and would be curious to find parties/etc. in New Haven too.

If you're here over the summer and we share any interests (or even none at all) definitely shoot me a PM! 

Also my program said I'll be staying in Yale housing but haven't given specifics yet so if anyone has any perspective on what that's like it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Super late on this, but I can definitely give some tips. I work with housing and the summer programs so if you wanna know whats around I can let you know. You might even have access to Paine-Whitney Gym which is apparently the worlds tallest gym. Which is kinda cool.

Do you care for nightlife in terms of clubs?

I cannot raise these grades whatsoever... This is what I will have after I do all the extra credit possible. I'm a prospective neuro major admitted RD and I have had 2 Bs in the past in calculus. I also have a valid reason if they were to demand a letter explaining the 2 Cs. Will I get rescinded?
No - you’re fine.
No
No, relax and enjoy your undergrad life next year.  Study first, but then make sure to have fun.
You are fine unless you fail a course
Pre-Recorded Interview
Man that was terrible. I stuttered so bad and said UM way too much! One of the questions i didn’t really know how to respond to until after the recording was done and i feel like they should’ve gave us a chance to redo it. Not a great option for those with anxiety.
In person or even zoom interviews are not at all the same.
op- sorry about the other kind of rude response. Look, it happens! I too stumbled a many times during the interview but you can’t change anything now. You did your best in the given 2 minutes, even if it was what you wanted it to be. Be proud you completed it and put yourself out there! Stumbling is much better than not doing it at all. <3
Are you serious? What’s going to happen when you have to do an actual interview for a job? Also, the StandOut interview is completely optional; you didn’t even have to do it.

How do y’all feel that Rodney Thomas II was drafted by the Colts?
Not a student, will probably never step foot on a Ivy League Campus, but I wonder how people at a Ivy League school feel about one of their own getting drafted
Ryan Fitzpatrick and Matt Berk (Future HOF) came from Harvard
Definitely more Ivy League grads than most think on the nfl. Kyle Juszxcych went to some school in Cambridge lol
Didn’t know until this post, tbh. Sports aren’t a big deal on campus except when we play Harvard. I haven’t heard anything about this but I’m sure the circles closer to him are ecstatic. I’m happy for him too. Booga Booga!
It happens
I’m an alum and I’m happy for him. I didn’t know who he was, even though I do watch a good chunk of our games via ESPN+.

Yale alum Foyesade Oluokun lead the NFL in tackles last year. He was a 6th round pick in 2018. 

We had a guy, Miye Oni, drafted in the 2nd round of the NBA draft in 2019.

do you regret going to yale?
title
How was it different?
for me regret isn't the right word - was it very different from what i was expecting + a bit of a shock initially? yes. do i regret having chosen to come here? absolutely not.
I regret letting the imposter syndrome (that most students go through when they get here) get to me as much as it did at the beginning. It was so bad for me the first semester. This second semester has been a lot better. I definitely don’t regret it.
What issues?
Getting rid of shopping period and forcing us to apply and register for classes during midterm/finals. From what I know, the change was so that professors weren’t struggling to get more TAs and a larger room if more people than expected wanted into the class. But basically every class has a cap now, so they aren’t actually accommodating the amount of people who want to take a certain class (I’m currently begging for a spot into a class that I need for grad school). Also shopping period was so fun. I hate that they got rid of it in general

Durfees to BowWow switch: the bow wow isn’t an inherently bad switch, but the food prices have gone up a lot more than the value of our meal swipe, so it’s hard to get a good meal out of a swipe. They also have insane security for it now and the self checkout machines are always breaking (there are no regular checkouts either) 

These are the biggest things I take issue with
this \^\^
I don’t think yale is perfect, it has a lot of issues, but honestly I don’t think I could ever regret my decision to attend here. It’s really a place where I feel at home, and I’m going to miss the faculty of my department when I graduate next year. Ahh I’m already dreading leaving, even as I’m excited for my future 🥲
Honestly no. Yale isn’t perfect but the issues I have here are issues I would have at any of the other schools I was considering. I think I made the right choice and I’m pretty happy here.
Why?
Bad might be an inaccurate term, but certainly isn’t good. Other people at my level of education in my field have significantly more hard skills and soft networking and hands on experience than I got at Yale. Yale is great if you want to go into consulting or project management, less ideal if your goal is to work as a practicing engineer.
Yep. The fancy name fooled me, Yale is a pretty bad school for engineering
I wouldn’t say I ever regretted it, but I did wonder what my life would have been like had I made another decision. I feel like deciding on a college was the first big decision that I got to make by myself that materially changed the course of my life/the people I met, and it’s hard not to think about what it could have been like, ya know. But not regret, no.
Not at all, amazing place.
I let this post go for a while before responding, but why the fuck would I? I jumped ten levels of economic status, made countless friends, met my wife, and had a damn good time. Yale's great. Any college is great. There are things Yale made me miss, but also things it gave to me. Yale was literally the best single thing in my life.
No, I don't regret going to Yale. But I wonder if I would send my daughter here.

Yale is an amazing place, but like all US colleges, it's so very expensive. I understand that expense if you're launching yourself into finance, consulting, medicine, or some other professional degree. But I'm a creative. Some people in my field have an MFA, but it really isn't necessary. So I graduated with my BA in the middle of the financial crisis and couldn't beg my way into an unpaid internship. I had to survive by my wits, something I would've had to do with a less impressive degree (or even no degree at all).

Also, as an old fart, I worry that Yale doesn't have the same intellectual freedom that it did when I was there.

But Yale definitely formed me in more ways than I can count.
aw no! It’s okay it’ll get better :)
I made the decision to go to Yale over Princeton last year (this day actually).  If you gave me the opportunity to go back in time a year and choose differently, I think I would agonize over it as much as I did last year.  It's a great school but there's a lot wrong with it and my living situation was very difficult.  If I was put in a different suite I think the decision would be easier.
Damn close to my 30th reunion and it’s worth more now than ever
More often than I should. I wish I had had the courage to apply to schools that were better suited to what I wanted to pursue as a career. There was a lot of pressure from my family to go to an Ivy. While I do love the people here at Yale, there are very few classes I actually enjoy and I feel like I'm trudging towards my bachelor's until I can go to the school I really want post-grad. I feel however that my situation is a bit unique since I am an art student
I regret some things I did and didn't do here
Lol, no!

Seriously though: no.

What are you really asking here?
I didn’t go to Yale
There are many parts about yale I don’t like and many parts I do like.
how come
yes
Nope. The only thing I regret is not getting even more involved as I progressed. There are so many opportunities. It's very easy to fall in with a tight group of friends from Freshman year and/or within your college and not take advantage of everything it has to offer. Sure there are douchebags (like everywhere), but there are thousands of tremendous people and opportunities that you can keep meeting and enjoying. Try to do at least one new thing every year.

How Competitive is it to get into the Global Affairs Major?
I'm choosing between Princeton (planning to major in the School of Public and International Affairs) and Yale, where I'm planning to major in Global Affairs. I've recently discovered that admissions into the Global Affairs is "competitive." How competitive is it and is it possible for me not to get into the major (I listed it in first place when I applied)?
Thank you for replying! Definitely helpful.
i don't think it's that competitive. i'm not a global major, but i've only ever met two people who applied and didn't get in versus the dozens i know who applied and did. that's anecdotal, though, so take from it what you will. (but whether or not u listed it on ur application won't make a difference.)

on a different note, i highly, *highly* advise not basing ur decision on princeton vs. yale on global alone. i came into yale seriously dead-set on studying global, took two classes in the department, and decided it wasn't for me. ur academic interests will invariably change throughout college, so please don't weigh ur major too heavily picking a school! 

best of luck <3
It's not *too* competitive, I can't think of anyone I know who got rejected. Whether you listed it on your application will not weight into any sort of decision.

I will also second what u/tinybirds_ said in terms of deciding between colleges. Most Yalies change major, and you are unlikely to be unique in that regard. Other factors (academics in other fields you're interested in, social life, location etc etc) are v important.
Thank you for replying! Definitely helpful.
How are you feeling?
Hello friends, 

How are you all holding up? I hope you’re doing well

Taking a class for Credit
Is it frowned upon to take a class for credit? I want to take some classes that are relatively hard and aren’t necessary for my major without the stress of having to worry about the grade or anything, but I don’t know much about the credit/D/F option. If you get a D or an F, is it weighted into your GPA?
yes, if you get a D or an F, it does count (negatively) to your GPA. If you get a credit, it doesn't count negatively or positively towards GPA. It isn't frowned upon at all to take a class Credit/D and you actually don't have to tell the professor or the other students in the class that you're doing it if you don't want to. Nobody in any social setting would ever judge you for it in any case.
Just ask your DUS or registrar. But also, the answe to your question is that it is not frowned upon. If you take it pass/fail it is NOT weighed to gpa.
Definitely not frowned upon. There are some professors that even encourage students to take a class Credit/D/fail to limit stress. I feel bad for students who have to take those types of classes for a letter grade!!
Use the Cr/D/F option to explore classes you wouldn't normally take, or ones that are generally more difficult or skew towards lower grades. As a STEM major I took a fascinating writing-heavy philosophy class, and I didn't have to stress over the papers. The option is there -- use it. Just don't get too lax and end up getting D/F, because that will hurt you.
What are your thoughts on Yale engineering
I like Yale a lot, but am a little concerned it may be dumb to pick Yale environmental engineering over Stanford. However, I don’t think I want to be an engineer, rather have the skills and engineering degree provides for future career options. Thoughts?
Totally agree. Stanford is better for kids who wanna be actual engineers, whereas Yale engineering is more a signaling thing
Plenty of us chose Yale over Stanford and went on to be real engineers too 😛  

You learn the same physics at Yale as you do anywhere else, frequently out of the same textbook! You may as well spend 4 years somewhere you love rather than go somewhere “for the program”  

95% of the joy, fulfillment, and growth I experienced in college happens outside the classroom. Super glad I didn’t make a choice based just on which school I perceived to have a “better program”
Don’t know what you mean by signaling
I did Yale engineering not so long ago. I was an environmental engineering major for about a year but I ultimately switched to a different engineering major. I had an excellent experience and am so glad I went where I did. Environmental engineering at Yale is decent: the department is small which has its pros (small classes, easier to navigate, meet faculty) and cons (fewer opportunities/course options). Few engineering students from Yale go on to be engineers, but the quantitative major, like you said, is useful on a resume. Engineering at Yale is not competitive and is academically more flexible than most schools in terms of coursework. There is a student maker space (the CEID) that also functions as a study space, social space, and free crafting/tool shop that I LOVED going to. I was also deciding between Harvard and MIT but I am so glad I chose Yale. I think my undergrad experience was chiller academically and gave me the space to grow extracurricularly and socially which is what I really needed. Both the Yale name and the Stanford name will get you far so it’s really just a matter of where gives you a better vibe.
Yale is close to home and better social life. Besides the programs at Stanford being better, yale takes the cake in all other aspects
I’m not close to anyone at Stanford, so I wouldn’t be able to compare the two. The stereotype I have of them is that their programs are rigorous, cost of living is out of this world, but that they do have many intelligent faculty and students. Whichever school you choose, you’ll probably have complaints about it down the road. I do think Stanford engineering has more prestige associated with them but Yale and Stanford are both top tier schools. What do you like about Yale? Sometimes we’re just more drawn to choices that don’t seem like the better choice from an objective view. If there’s not much of a value difference between two choices, just choose what excites you more. What you make of that choice is what matters anyway. I would, however, look into which school offers more resources on preparing for the career path you want to go into.
if you want to be not an engineer but someone with an engineering skillset, then Yale is an excellent choice. I am a current chemE student with so much direct involvement in the envE side of the department, and it is well-established to be exceptional given its size (graduate program ranked 9th for 6 (now 7) full time faculty members). yale envE has a unique take on environmental engineering that few other schools share: they are chemical engineering at the core, but with strong environmental topical focus. yale does not have civil engineering, so it does not mean that you are building bridges. if, however, you are interested in water-air quality solutions, yale has some of the cutting-edge research for these topics. undergraduate research with yale faculty is so easy, and will get even easier given the incoming faculty member's curricular plans.
I think Yale is strong. Yale has been consistently upping their investment in STEM and I think that it's been paying off in the career performance of graduates. I don't think there's a meaningful difference in the  major between the two schools. I can't say much about Stanford, but I feel strongly that the community of Yale is it's biggest strength. I've found it to be be a very environment, and I think that that are a lot of cool things that help to make the undergrad experience enjoyable alongside merely being productive. Also, the school of forestry and environmental stories building is really well designed and right next to Steep.
One way to help you make this decision is to take a look at the hands on resources that each school has to offer to support you in studying your specific niche. We learn best by doing. Most university websites have a page about their research centers and initiatives, and I recommend reading through the offerings of both schools there.
Overpriced for what you are getting. But you’ll have a Yale degree
Plenty of us chose Yale over Stanford and went on to be real engineers too 😛  

You learn the same physics at Yale as you do anywhere else, frequently out of the same textbook! You may as well spend 4 years somewhere you love rather than go somewhere “for the program”  

95% of the joy, fulfillment, and growth I experienced in college happens outside the classroom. Super glad I didn’t make a choice based just on which school I perceived to have a “better program”
Don’t know what you mean by signaling
Totally agree. Stanford is better for kids who wanna be actual engineers, whereas Yale engineering is more a signaling thing
Yale is close to home and better social life. Besides the programs at Stanford being better, yale takes the cake in all other aspects

Current or Former Yalies: Give us a list of the extracurriculars you were involved in and what you loved about them!
What did you do outside of class? Plays? Debate? Competitive chess? I want to know everything!
Omg! I love a good crossword. Although, I don't know if I could do it competitively as I do resort to Google sometimes. That is so cool, and thanks so much for replying!
>I do resort to Google sometimes

I wouldn't even call it "resorting" to Google -- part of the fun of the puzzle is learning what you don't know, and sometimes you have to lean on external resources to complete it.
Formed a competitive crossword-solving club, and hosted an annual tournament on campus.

My point: if something doesn't exist on campus, you have all the power to create it yourself and make it happen!
Yes! As you can see, I really love extracurriculars and find they give me structure that helps me with my classes. It's a really weird dynamic that I am trying to balance. Thank you so much for your answer to both questions!
My #1 recommendation is comedy. I was involved in The Yale Record (humor magazine) and The Cucumber (stand-up), and they were some of the most important parts of my college experience. I hear a lot of people now say they wished they tried comedy in college, and the Yale scene for it is really good, varied, and generally quite welcoming to newcomers.

I also saw your other post about extracurrics and I will say I tried doing 4-5 when I was a first-year and totally flamed out. 2 main ones (my other was a club sport) and casual engagement with a 3rd was the right level for me. It's OK to try out lots of stuff to start and then decide what makes you happy. 

Edit: Also, Yale has a club for everything, and if it doesn't exist yet it's really easy to make a new club. So pursue what you love!
Haha, so glad this is your first comment. Is it still active? It sounds like something I will be doing anyway.
I can’t speak for them but I’m like 99% positive they were active during this year’s bulldog days so probably, they usually send out an email to all the first years in the summer and I think they recruit from there
ysecs
If you succeed, I will be your first member!
I'm trying to make a club whose sole purpose is to pay for spa trips lol
I know some friends that loved their bulldog days event!
It was ages ago but the best times I had were with the YPMB.  It felt like we never won a football game but the routines were so much fun.  And we didn't practice as much as you'd think.

Family History Through Yale
Hello!
I was looking through my family History documents and I found relatives of mine who are Jewish.
I am currently in the process of converting to Judaism and would love to get into contact with my relatives.

I know very little about this branch of the family other than the name of someone who studied at Yale in the '90s. Is it possible that I could access this contact or no.
Yea, that makes sense. Thanks!
Use Anscestry.com. A university is unlikely to assist you because they must protect student privacy.
Yea, that makes sense. Thanks!
How are the counseling and mental health services at Yale?
Committed yesterday! Boola boolaaaaaa
Unironically pretty awful lol, it’s gotten slightly better recently but not by much.
Like every other college, they're not great. Colleges only started to care about student mental health very recently, so the systems just are not great right now. The trend is that its getting better, though, mostly through the work of student advocacy groups like the mental health association which are actively working to improve the systems in place
There are definitely more ways to speed up the system developing which is a help.
They are ehhhh. Wait times can be long. If you know you have a history of mental illness or mental health challenges, you should get signed up with 
the counseling office right away and do a preventative intake appointment. If you end up having an issue it’s much easier to get seen as an established patient rather than a new one
There are definitely more ways to speed up the system developing which is a help.
Anyone Subletting over the Summer?
Hey, I don't go here (I'm a student at Purdue), but I recently accepted an internship offer at Medtronic Surgical Robotics located in North Haven for the sunmer. My offer came really late, but I was wondering if anyone is interested in subletting their apartment (I would be in CT from May 23 to August 19). Thanks so much!
Try to join the Yale off campus or a New Haven apartment Facebook groups for subletting.
Yale Graduation is on the 23rd, so it might be rough to find an available apartment for then.
I have a place! Message me for details
Message me! I have a room available
omg Purdue
Housing and Advising Form
I'm an admitted student, and I have already created my NetID and my YaleConnect account; however, I don't seem to find the Housing and Advising Form anywhere. I already checked the MySurverys/Forms but it says there isn't anything to do. Where can I find this form, or will it take a bit longer to appear (I accepted my admission on April 9th)?
Thank you so much! I was a bit confused bc the portal said in the beginning of April
The Yale website says the form will become available on May 4th!
Thank you so much! I was a bit confused bc the portal said in the beginning of April
Chicago Roommate
Anyone looking for a roommate this summer in the Chicago area? trying to find a place to live for my internship.
Summer housing
I just got a job offer in the area and I am looking for summer housing! All I need is a bed, bathroom, and a parking spot. If you or  a friend need a summer sublease, please help me out! 

If yalls have any tips or know of any housing groups, please let me know. 

Edit: feel free to dm me or comment
Will do!

San Francisco Bay Area to new Haven
How to most people travel from Bay Area (SFO or OAK airport) to Yale since there are no direct flights to New Haven Airports? Would love to hear from anyone who has a great route and hear how long the total travel time is (assuming trains). Thanks!
There are also trains from EWR directly to New Haven Union, which are incredibly convenient (albeit not that frequent)
Thanks, very helpful!
Thanks for the info. I appreciate it and if I have any specific questions as I confirm my plans, I will DM you.
NYC-based alum here. Your best bet would be to fly to one of the major NYC airports (JFK, LGA, EWR) and take a Metro-North train from Grand Central or Harlem to New Haven's Union Station. You would need to use other local transit to get into Manhattan (NJ Transit, NYC bus/subway) but once you're at the train station, it's a hassle-free trip into New Haven. You can walk to campus or grab a taxi -- I walked from the station to Ezra Stiles, and I think it was around 15-20 minutes.

There are also Amtrak trains that travel from NY Penn Station to New Haven (slightly more convenient if you're using EWR), but they're a bit more expensive and less frequent for minimal time gain.

Feel free to DM if you want to get some itinerary details.
Thanks, I did and there are no direct flights.
JetBlue is supposed to have BDL-SFO direct flights again later in the year.
Thanks, I'll keep an eye on that!
U can try Hartford
Thanks, very helpful!
My hometown is San Diego, flew into Hartford or JFK during my time as a Yale grad student. DM me for details.
Thank you, I hadn't thought of Newark and appreciate the suggestion.  I love Amtrak!
I’ve only done the flight twice, but going to Newark and then taking an Amtrak up direct to New Haven (and the opposite) is quite simple
Thanks, I had been thinking flying into NY is probably the way to go. Californian accent? LOL!
I did New Haven <----> Bay Area for many years. NYC based airports are usually the best deal, you can get there easily via Metro North. Hartford and Westchester have also paid off for me occasionally, though you'll need transportation via car.

I'm a CA native and did get teased for my "thick Californian accent". :)
Appreciate all of the details. Definitely not a quick trip home to CA for students. ;)
What I did is fly SFO -> EWR, take a bus from EWR to Grand Central, then Metro North from Grand Central to New Haven Union station. Kinda takes a while and you could Amtrak from EWR to New Haven Union Station but not worth the cost imo, unless you're pressed for time. The bus takes around an hour or 1.5 hrs and the Metro North around 2 hrs iirc
Thanks for the excellent details! Good info. on subway as it will be my first time.
1. Fly to JFK

2. Take the AirTrain at JFK to Jamaica station

3. E train to 53rd/Lex, get off, transfer to the 6

4. Take the 6 to Grand Central

5. Take Metro North to Union Station, make sure to buy a ticket online or at grand central, you can’t use your metro card on this.

If you’ve never taken the subway before it may look a bit overwhelming but I promise it’s a breeze (and pretty cheap). 

I find that fares to JFK tend to be lower than LGA (and there isn’t an easy way to get to NH from Bradley AFAIK)
Thanks for the info. I appreciate it and if I have any specific questions as I confirm my plans, I will DM you.

Advice to find Loopholes
So my parents finally gave in and decided I should go to Yale. 

Issue is that they insisted I wear a tile tracker and leave my location on so they could see what I am doing.

They also said they could visit randomly anytime they want without letting me know. 

Is there a way to get around this besides the constant stress of spoofing my location? How closed off is the campus, and are there any areas restricted to students only?
I'll wear their tracker, that's fucked.

"What are you doing in Oregon, honey?"

"Mom, I graduated 20 years ago"
Thanks. Just know when my parents bring some dude to arrange a marriage with you, stay calm. Don’t forget to accept the forced marriage, my cousin didn’t and they made her handicapped. 

Really really appreciate you taking this off my hands!
I'll try to play it cool. Hopefully they don't notice you're already married to a white woman and have three kids. I think I can pull it off.
I'll wear your tracker, man. Fuck your parents lol
Most places on campus can only be accessed via an ID card
great info. Greatly appreciate this. 🤞🏼
Every residential college requires an ID key card to open the main gate, and students are not supposed to let strangers in. Once inside a college, the doors to dorm areas (stairwells) also require the ID key card again. And then the dorm rooms themselves are locked. Libraries also require student IDs to enter. It used to be more open to the public, but COVID restrictions and other security are now the norm. Your parents sound massively out of touch with reality and over protective. Sorry, but the sooner you can get away and find your own space, the better. Good luck!
Great idea! They also have access to the findmy feature on my iphone, so this would be super complicated. 

They don’t want me visiting the city, and might find me attending anywhere else besides classes (recreation centers) questionable. They are extremely traditional Muslims who think dating is a sin and that I shouldn’t hang out with dudes, wear t-shirts, shorts, or do anything too Americanized. That’s always been my life, so I don’t know what it’s like outside of those restrictions
Leave your tile tracker with your laptop. Your laptop is never going to go places your parents don't want you going and this will implicitly track your laptop for you.
Thank you so much for this!
Talk to your dean and FroCo once you step on campus about the situation with your parents. They can help put a plan in place to prevent that, or at least talk you through some options.

Next year, I anticipate that security will be lessened because of COVID. The stacks in Sterling cannot be accessed by non-Yale students, and the same
could be said for all of Bass after 6pm (I think). Your residential college’s own library requires at least two swipes (1 to get into the res college gates, and another to get into the library), sometimes three if you also have to swipe into an entryway. The dining halls will likely be open to the public again, but your parents would have to pay money to get in or use your guest swipe.
Thank you 🥹
I work on campus and live downtown. I’ll just wear it all day everyday. They’ll think your the biggest loser in the world lol.
Idk but life with them as of now is depressing, esp thinking about the future they are planning for me, via an arranged marriage
Put your tracker on handsome Dan lmfao what the fuck is wrong with your parents
Thx for letting me know!!!’
Tell your dean. They are accustomed to running interference. Also, your parents won’t be able to enter most parts of campus without an ID card.
If removed, will no longer coordinate with my schedule - aka buildings I’m usually in, and coupled with their FaceTime calls they’ll make.. oh no. 

They will know. And will make a fuss about it to my extended family, hence deteriorating the shrapnels of cultural honor I once had.
This traker you are supposed to wear, can be removed? And if removed are your parents going to know?
Yes I’m indeed Asian. I am also an ex-muslim in a traditional, super toxic Muslim family. 

Thank you for letting me know of this subreddit!!
Are you Asian? You could get advice from r/asianparentstories. Lots of people dealing with fucked up parents trying to control their kids. 

But yeah, if you’re able to get enough financial aid that you don’t have to depend on your parents, I would not indulge this tracker nonsense. Just keep it in your room. But play nice until you get to school.
Well first… if you don’t want to wear your tracker and leave your location on…you don’t have to. I know they’re your parents and everything but you’re going to be an adult and they can’t always have that control over you. If it becomes a point where they can’t trust you and you feel like it’s interfering with your studies or life in general and it worries you, or you don’t want them on campus, then let someone/ admin at Yale know. Students are usually their priority over the parents. I understand the concern your parents might have for you but sometimes it is time to let go and just support you.
Hypothetically, what would happen if you agreed provisionally, then, once you got to Yale, ignored their request? That’s one option. 

I understand some areas of New Haven might have a perception of being dangerous and they may just want you to be safe. But, seems they’re not respecting your personal space/privacy. If your safety is all they are concerned with, then maybe there’s another way you could let them know you’re ok without them having to track you everywhere do spontaneous check-ups. Like, just giving them a call every couple days? Will they reason with you at all?
I wish overprotective parents could truly see the devious minds they produce lol
I wish. also scared bc they are planning on marrying me off in the coming years. They think dating is a sin and it makes me miserable that at Yale I won’t ever be my own person

Timeline to find housing? (Grad student)
Hi there! I'm an incoming grad student starting my PhD at Yale this fall (woohoo!!). I need to be moved in by August 1 as I have a course starting that day. What is the right timeline to be searching for off-campus housing? I'm on the facebook page but it is still mostly summer sublets and there isn't a whole lot on websites like apartments.com/zillow right now. Should I already be looking, or is it too early? Any recommendations on where I should be looking or general tips? Thanks! :)
And Farnam.
Hey I just applied for housing with Elm Campus Partners as well. It’s unclear to me how their process works after you submit an application. Will they reach out to me as apartments become available?
Thank you so much! This is helpful!
It was really unclear to me too in the beginning. So you can search through apartments that will become available soon. These apartments will have a "viewing" date listed. It's not a true "viewing" but it's the date the apartment will be released for bids. On those days, you then select apartments and order them according to your preference. After the "viewing" day is closed, the company then looks through all apartment bids. Individuals with older accounts will get priority on preference. If you were chosen for an apartment, you will be given an offer and you will have 48 hours to accept. Then everything resets again for a new "viewing". The first time I tried I didn't get any offers so I think it really depends on timing. I got fortunate this time because I was looking for a lease starting in June/July. Let me know if you need any more help :).
No problem! Best wishes :).
Thanks so much for explaining this. The UI on their website is so confusing and old.
As a follow up, if you're looking for an apartment for september, when is a good time to check?
Honestly if you're hoping to use Elm Campus I would start looking now just in case. Or at least make an account. Since I've already accepted I can't go check but as soon as your account is approved you can look at available places to get an idea of rental dates. I might start looking now just to see! And agreed about your previous comment. It's really confusing. Someone explained it to me. If you need more help you can PM me :).
Congrats on your admission! You should check out Elm Campus Partners ( [https://elmcampus.com/](https://elmcampus.com/) ). They are Yale off-campus housing but can fill up quite fast. The website/process was a little confusing to me at first so feel free to PM me if you'd like an explanation. Otherwise I would just keep checking :). When I moved here I subletted a place for 2 months, then I found an apartment on Craigslist. Now I'm moving into an Elm Campus owned apartment.

Edit: There are some companies to avoid. I'm still new to the city so hopefully others would be more helpful but don't lease anything from Pike International and I think Mandy (something).
can you list a few that you're a part of?

Which Facebook page are you in? I’m seeing a ton of apartment listings in the ones I’m in.
Also, which area of town are you looking at on Zillow? I see quite a lot of apartments on there in East Rock, which is where quite a number of grad students live. It’s more quiet and neighborhood-ly, less like a college town setting.

Has Anyone Taken "Art and Myth in Greek Antiquity?"
If so, how was it (in terms of quality and/or difficulty)?
Great class, not very difficult at all. When I took it it had 3 papers (total length 16 pages) and a timed final.

Milette gaifman is a treasure of Yale’s art history department, and at least when I took it 3 years ago it was an easy WR. Section is pretty enjoyable, with trips to the YUAG, and Professor Gaifman is great at keeping lectures engaging and funny. Remains one of the highlights of my time at Yale.
Awesome class! Pretty gutty WR credit, which is great!
Trips to the YUAG are certainly pretty neat.
Does anyone know how I can audit a class here (preferably online)?
I'm a current high school student, and I would love to sit in on a Yale class via Zoom this summer.
Hmm, would a professor mind if I sit in on a class on campus? I've heard of Coursera, but generally it costs money to earn a certificate? Also, I was looking at CC courses.
Last I checked, auditing actually costed just as much as taking the class. ETA: and many professors still expect you to do the work and participate. You just don’t get a grade.
Thank you!
few ways!  


\- you can find Yale classes online via Open Yale Courses and Coursera  
\- you can pay to participate in Yale Summer Session, but I think it can be pretty pricy  
\- you can take similar classes at a local CC a lot of the time

What to bring to Bulldog Days?
What am I sleeping on for the students hosting?😭

Edit: y’all are actually funny. Whoever made the comment abt sour cream chips—that made my morning  lmaooo
Thank you! I already knew the basics and standard “away from home”‘packing, but wanted to double check with the sleeping bag
Check the weather! Also a pillow.
If you are staying with a student host, you can expect to sleep in the common room of a suite, either on a couch or on the floor, so definitely bring a sleeping bag. I never got the chance to go to bulldog days, but I imagine that other than the essentials you might want to bring a water bottle and a light jacket
large plastic bag👍👍
A sleeping bag😁😁
bring some chips and dip tbh I'm hungry
Bulldog days host here! Bring a sleeping bag, you will be on the floor lol. We have two couches but they're giving us four kids.
Check the weather! Also a pillow.

What is the maximum amount of extracurriculars you have seen a Yale student successfully be involved in?
As Bulldog Days approach, clubs all over campus are preparing to impress incoming admitted students. For us admitted students, how many extracurriculars should we realistically expect to be able to commit to? What is the maximum you've seen? I know this varies based on how committed each extracurricular is, but I would love any anecdotes or numbers or anything!
Got it! I just feel interested in everything, so I am trying to set some hard limits on how much I commit after shopping around for a couple of weeks. Do you have any club recommendations?
Sure, what are you interested in?
Research, community service, debate, finance, and theatre/comedic writing? I think those are the top 5. I also really want to join Bookbinding, but that doesn't fit in any of those areas funnily enough.
Honestly, the hottest comedy release on campus is probably the yaleactualweeklynews instagram page, they're much funnier than the record, which very few people actually read. Don't join YUDI lol. YPU is probably in a worse state than when I was there not so long ago, the point of the YPU is to join and find a home in a political party, not to actually participate in the YPU.
There's a lot of standup comedy groups that I'm sure will be doing their best to pick up students. The Record (satire magazine) is also a great organization. If the Cinemat has anything going on during Bulldog Days, definitely check them out, too. The Yale Political Union has a lot of debate events if you're politically inclined. The Yale Debate Association is also absolutely something you should look at. Not sure about finance -- maybe the Yale Entrepreneurial Society? For research I would just recommend taking your classes, finding something interesting in them, and asking your professor/a professor that has more to do with that thing if they'd like to take you on.
Bookbinding is extremely chill. Show up to one of a few intro workshops at the beginning of the semester, and then you’re pretty much free to go whenever. If you want to learn more techniques (leather, Coptic, etc.), just ask one of the board leaders and they’ll set up a time to work with you if you can’t get the more advanced workshops to work with your schedule
What's wrong with YUDI?
Got it! Gosh, I am so excited. A brand new google calendar!!!
YUDI (yale undergrad diversified investments) isn’t that bad. YSIG (yale student investment group) is the foremost investing group and the most career / Wall Street oriented one. UP fund (undergraduate philanthropic) is a socially responsible one that’s decent. If u know a finance career is you, go for YSIG, if you’re iffy on it and like the YUDI ppl more do that as it’s not impossible to get to Wall Street from there.
oh it’s like a joke organization that no one takes seriously, the other org that actually invests with real money (i forgot the name) that’s competitive to get into is the one that you want. Since wall street people actually went to yale, they know yudi is a joke so it’s useless. 

also buy two good suits for college. one black suit one other one. you’ll need it.
Of course. Happy to help!
Okay! Let me know if you figure out what that other organization was. Socially Responsible Investing?
oh im sure you’ll know. one has a yearly gala where people wear black tie, the others don’t
Totally depends from group to group (unless it's sports, which is something I'm not the best source on). In my experience, most don't have any sort of requirement with respect to the amount of time you spend on them, though if you sign up to do some project you're pretty much obligated to finish it. I've had weeks where I've worked twenty hours on single projects and I've had weeks barely having anything to do with non-course-related stuff.

My advice: If you run into a club you're interested in joining, just ask them!

double majoring
I’m interested in double majoring in two very different subjects, studio art and international relations. Someone on here told me that the difficulty and value of a double major depends on my majors. Does a double major in these fields seem plausible, and if so, how difficult? I’m trying to decide between double majoring at Yale or doing the Brown RISD Dual Degree (five years), and I would like to know what to expect from double majoring at Yale.
yes, it’s global affairs! every school has a different name, so i’ve just been using international relations because it’s the most recognized version of the major, sorry for the confusion! and thanks for your reply, it’s very insightful!
Okay so the undergrad art major requires 14 course credits, global affairs\* requires 13 course credits (and an L5 language course). That's 27 course credits, and depending on what language you're going to do and how far along you already are with it, that could be 1-7 additional credits (not sure if you can place into L5s, but I assume it's possible). I doubt either would cover the science requirement (2 credits), looks like global covers QR reqs, I would assume you'd end up in WR credits with global at some point, humanities/art reqs would be covered, and global should also cover social science reqs. 

If you only take classes for the completion of these majors and 2 science credits (assuming you start as L1 for your language for global), you'll hit 36 credits (the required amount to graduate). So it seems doable, especially if you have a good grasp on a non-English language already (that would give you some wiggle room to just take classes you find interesting).

\*I think global affairs is the Yale equivalent of international relations, not 100% sure, international relations isn't in the Yale list of majors and I assume global is the closest thing?
Studio art is one of the most time consuming majors Yale offers. Check out past course offerings to get a better idea of how your prospective classes will be scheduled. Best of luck to you.
yes, it’s global affairs! every school has a different name, so i’ve just been using international relations because it’s the most recognized version of the major, sorry for the confusion! and thanks for your reply, it’s very insightful!
IB diploma
Hey, does anyone know if u have to report whether of not u received the ib diploma to Yale? Like I have all A’s in my courses and I’m going to sit for the tests but I’m really worried abt the outcome lol
Thank you for this, def relieving.
junior at yale here. to this day i’ve never even checked my official IB scores. i just submitted my predicted scores on my yale app and never thought about it again.
Thank you for this, def relieving.
How feasible is it to complete a ba in Comp Sci as well as the bs/ma program in statistics at Yale?
And must it be done in four years, or does five also work? Thanks!
Maybe possible? You would have almost zero choice over schedule. It would be a total of 32 courses. You can double count 2, meaning you would only have to take 30. That leaves 6-10 open spots for distributional requirements. Assuming you can fill the Quant. Reasoning and Social Studies via your degrees (ex. Econometrics for S&DS), you have 2 writing courses, 2 humanities, and 2 sciences. Finally, you may have to take up to 3 language credits. This puts you at a total of 39 credits, 3 over the needed to graduate, and 1 under the amount you would have if you took the max of 5 courses per semester ( you can override 5, but only with approval).

P.S. It has to be done in 4 for the BS/MA
agreed. im doing bs in s&ds (contemplating bs/ma) w/ certificate in programming and even then it's a good chunk of classes and challenging workload
Would be a lot more realistic to get the programming certificate alongside the ba/ma, only 6 credits as opposed to 12 credits for the ba. also, both of those are gonna be tough as hell, no matter how smart you are, just in sheer workload
Most likely possible. I’m currently doing a BS/MS in Chemistry and am getting a BA in Poli Sci. Your schedule will probably be pretty tight though!

Are Essays Printed Out or Are They Read Digitally?
Does anyone know what the Admission Office’s practice is? This is just out of curiosity.
If you’re thinking of putting a link, don’t do it
If you’re thinking of putting a link, you can. I did in my application and they actually clicked it (saw in the analytics) and got an interview request the day that they checked. Ultimately got accepted.
Is there an email address for accepted to students to ask questions regarding major requirements and courses?
Thanks!
At the extra-curricular bazaar for bulldog days (if you’re going), there will be stands for a lot of majors where you can ask the DUS or current people in the major. If not, maybe try emailing the DUS of the major of interest
There are very helpful websites for each department online; if you look up “Yale Major Roadmaps,” you will find visual outlines of the requirements for many majors.
Reach out to the department. Alternatively, you can wait until you arrive and speak with your department chair in person.
Yale merch on the Yale campus??
Incoming freshman here, going to Bulldog Days this year and am very excited!! I just have a silly question about merch and whether it'd be weird to wear it when I'm on the campus for the event?? One of my warmest outfits involves a Yale sweater and I just don't know whether it would be pretentious/bad taste to actually wear it on campus (since I've heard mixed thoughts on the issue). Thoughts?? Thank you!!
thats good info i didn't consider before, tysm!! and here i was planning on bringing all my turtlenecks haha
Wear whatever you want, yalies wear Yale gear all the time. But don't plan on needing super warm clothing- it should be like 60+ degrees all that week. Bring an umbrella and a light jacket, but we are mostly past cold weather
thats good to hear!! congrats on duke and ty for the input 💙!!
I was just at Dukes admitted student days and I would say 25% of actual students were wearing Duke merch, and 50% of admitted students were wearing Duke merch. Of course it may be a different culture, but I say go for it. I know I’ll be wearing some (or at least the free t shirt).
ive heard some people refer to it as snobby?? like trying to chase prestige/"clout" when everyone else also has claim to it and it being a bit redudant since wearing college merch is meant to signifiy you go there while your physically a student on the campus. ive just heard some stuff like that on why it might be bad taste bc of that and i just didnt wanna give off the wrong vibe yknow??
There is merit to this argument imo but it is not practiced at all, a large % of students wear merch every single day.
Woah I didn’t even imagine it could look snobby to some people. It may be because I’m international, and I’m not entirely familiarized with the culture related to prestige in top colleges. Tbh I’d just use the merch and enjoy!!
Do not worry about this. I (and everyone else I know) wears Yale stuff way more on campus than off, tbh
thats good to hear thank you sm!! bc lowkey i like wearing the sweaters its validating 🥺🥺 and i think i look good in the dark blue yale color
there's def a certain way to navigate prestige bc its easy to come off as snobby if you bring it up a lot, brag about it in unrelated conversations, etc but i like your mindset of just using the merch!! you've earned the right to that Y 👍👍
One thing you might find is that people tend to more often wear residential college gear than Yale gear, although both are still common. You certainly won’t look out of place or anything wearing Yale stuff.

Edit: I think this partially because I received a huge amount of college mercy for free/cheap but would have had to buy Yale stuff myself, with official Yale stuff also tending to be more expensive.
ah okay i see!! if its free merch i see why + everyone seems v prideful in their college and insists that their's the best yknow?? i cant wait until i get my college placement and get to join in on the fun 🥳
The only residential college merch I see commonly is Branford and Trumbull hats lol, maybe sometimes those sillimander t-shirts or the grey and red TD merch but that's about it
Incoming freshman too. Just curious here, but why would it be pretentious or bad taste? I was thinking of buying some merch and probably using it too
I know someone who wore a UNC jacket to a Duke information session. He got in, and wore it again on campus a few days ago. No word on how that went.

So the moral of this story is to wear Harvard swag.
In my experience, about a third of campus is wear Yale gear at any point in time, within growing substantially during hoodie season.
they recently released their liscense thingy so cheaper yale shirts and sweaters are popping up now!! ive seen a few in the stores near me and i have one to two haha, so i guess i dont mind buying yale merch when its $30 >. either way it looks as though there is diversity on whether college merch on the campus is tasteful or not 🤷‍♀️

Visiting Yale need advice
Hi!  I’ll be on campus on Monday for a meeting. I scheduled my flight way ahead of time so I’ll have a couple of hours to kill. Is there a good place that a visitor could get free Wi-Fi and maybe spend an hour or two?  Also any recommended places to park?  Thanks so much!!
Yale has free guest wifi, so if you don't mind sitting outside you could find a table or bench in the Schwartzman center plaza or old campus
Fussy Coffee is a good coffee shop with free wifi. There’s a bunch of others too (Blue State and Willoughby’s for example).
Koffee! On Audubon is quite a decent hang, meets all requirements.
There’s benches all over campus where you can use the free yale guest wifi and also a ton of coffee shops!!
Open Campus
I will be visiting Yale next week but I was wondering if the public can walk around campus and do a self-guided tour? Thank you
ah thank you! would I still need to check in at the visitor center or could I just walk on to campus?
You should just walk right on to campus. Note that only outdoor spaces are open to the public rn, with the exception of the Bienecke which is open to the public for limited hours on the weekends.
Thank you!!
old campus is also open! There should be a ton of prefrosh on camupus next weekend as well, so I’m sure you can get away with walking into courtyards behind people—libraries and stuff need ID access though so it would be harder without someone to guide you
Yep, the self guided tour is through an app you can find on the app store

general advice for prefrosh asking about majors and degrees
Everyone enters Yale undeclared for a reason. When you get to campus you are going to be inundated with advisors and mentors who are trained to help you figure this stuff out. It's great to look at course listing and major requirements before coming to Yale, but chances are you are not going to end up in the major you thought you would before you came to campus- most people don't and that's a good thing. Have fun exploring course search, but don't stress about it because you literally have years to figure that out. Same with dual degrees and double majors, which you can declare your junior and senior year.

Also, you're going to be stressed about your major for four years- why start now?
Also (someone correct me if I am wrong) but your "piece of paper" will only include one of the majors: your transcript will contain both, sure, but your diploma will only display one. More of a symbolic gesture than anyone else, but I think the messaging behind that is important
Yes! Thank you! Also reposting what I’ve commented on eleventy-seven different “Can I double major in X and Y??” posts)  

LPT: you don’t have to major in something to have a fulfilling educational experience in that topic. You can always take the classes that interest you rather than just to meet the major requirements.  

I promise you, having a paper that says you met two different sets of requirements isn’t nearly as exciting as being a “double major” sounds
If you're leaning STEM, there are pre-reqs that most STEM majors require, it's good to start on those first year. If you find that you are no longer vibing with STEM (like I did), it's not much of a loss, you've got your STEM distributional reqs at least mostly out of the way. If you are leaning humanities, you can honestly take a variety of classes that sound fun to you to figure out what exactly you like and might want to commit to. Definitely would suggest getting into a first year seminar at some point too! I don't think your first year course decisions will really affect you down the road, you don't need to stress whether a first year course will look good for post-grad admissions and stuff like that.
How do you recommend going about picking classes for the freshman fall semester? And do freshman fall classes have much bearing on things later down the road (like access to internships/research, availability of various majors, post-grad admissions, etc.)?

University/ house parties. New here figuring out what is the party scene here.
Would appreciate it. Want to connect with people in yale.
given the small class size -- few house parties (cuz few people live off campus), few active frats/houses, decent number of suite parties/pregames on campus because there are no RAs.

Thursday drinking for seniors in society
So you want to go to parties at the chance of spreading Covid? Okay
