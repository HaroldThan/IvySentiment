Hey guys!

So I’m an (international) incoming freshman and was just going through the classes - do y’all think I should take 5 classes or stick to 4? Was choosing between: 
1. Econ - 110 (have a 5 in ap micro and 4 in macro)
2. Math 90/100 (not sure what to take)
3. CS 111 as I have no experience in it and think that it’ll be easier than 150? Plus I don't wanna spend too much time on it.
4. IAPA 110/Pols 10/400. (4 in ap comp gov if that matters)
5. ENGN 0090 (Entrepreneurship)

Do y’all think this is too much work or is it manageable? Was also wondering if taking the entrepreneurship course in my 1st semester wasn’t worth it as I’ll have a long time before I would possibly declare it as a certificate and idk I might even double concentrate! Any advice would be helpful!

Ideally, econ 110, math 100, cs 111, iapa 110 and engn 90. Potential concentrations are econ/econ apma/iapa/pols (dont think so as iapa is way more open)/something else?

Thanks!Hello everyone! I had a few questions about choosing courses as an incoming student.  


1) When exactly should I register for courses? Do I just have to add courses to my cart and register or do I need to get my courses approved by an advisor as well?  


2) How exactly do you "shop" classes?  


3) I am not sure which CS intro course to take... Should I try out two intro CS courses or will the extra intro course be excessive?  


4) If any of you have experience with Astronomy courses, how intense is the courseload for introductory courses?  


5) Is there a resource that can help me decide what math class might be best for me? I am familiar with the basics of calculus but I'm not sure how well my high-school education will translate to college.  


Thank you so much for your time! My apologies if this is not the best place to post this. Hope you have an amazing rest of your day!Saw on Brown’s page that they require 3 years of foreign language, saw elsewhere it was just recommendedThey really dragged all of us out of bed early just to have us stand in line for an hour and counting... classic Brown, wouldn't wanna end my 4 years any other way :D :D :DHey r/BrownU! I was just wondering if anyone here was majoring in/majored in the Computer Science-Economics major at Brown (or know anyone who is majoring in it), what your thoughts were on the major as a whole, how hard was it, and how many people typically take it? Thanks!hi! sorry very long but looking for people’s honest opinions so hope you will read this!

i am a prospective transfer to brown from cornell and am very torn about my decision (due the 31st). i just finished my freshman year at cornell and am undecided in the school of arts and sciences but lean towards humanities/social sciences/policy.

my first semester at cornell was rough: i didn’t feel like i was meeting people i connected with, the clubs felt really cutthroat so it was hard to get involved, and the school as a whole is very STEM-oriented. additionally, i came from a pretty small hs in california so the size and east coast culture were a shock (not that either is necessarily bad but very different from what i am used to). academically, it’s been a grind but i was surprised that i actually liked that culture (not the cutthroat part but working hard) and have also generally liked my classes and profs. second semester was def better: i met more people/became closer with ppl i vibe with more but still don’t feel like i have a close group of friends that i can count on—more individual friends. i also enjoyed my classes more and joined some clubs i like.

having chosen where i was going in the pandemic (i took a gap year), i do know cornell wasn’t the best fit for me (pre-professional, large) but there are clubs/classes/people i have become attached to and the academics seem to be a good fit (i like the selection of classes and there are some cool majors that seem unique to cornell).

one of the worst parts about cornell is that it seems to be a joke that people hate it. while obviously not everyone is unhappy, there is a vibe of people wanting to get out. in contrast, i’ve been talking to brown students and transfers and visited the campus and people seem to (for the most part) be really happy.

however, i don’t know if a lot of the broader, environmental factors at cornell would bother me as much if i felt like i had a close friend group which may just come with time and sticking it out. that aspect doesn’t really seem like it would be helped by transferring. if anything, that would put me at a “disadvantage” socially.

i do think brown’s location and general environment would be better. in terms of academics for me, the two seem even. brown’s international/public affairs program is very unique but there are also things cornell offers that brown doesn’t.

ultimately, i am not sure if transferring (which would come with its own challenges, period of readjustment, and ofc no guarantee that i’d be happier) is worth uprooting what i have invested into cornell (since life there seems to be getting better as i adjust but also knowing it’s not a perfect fit).

obviously, i feel very lucky to have this choice but can’t read the future so any thoughts would be appreciated. thanks! :)Are there any current students that would be willing to quickly show us around? I know this is a tough ask since the semester is over, but it would be greatly appreciated! thanks!IT'S GREG

WE HAVE NEWER DORMS. "NEW DORM" IS AN OBJECTIVELY TERRIBLE NAME

We have Wellness and are about to have 2 beautiful new dorm buildings on Brook Street. Calling Greg "New Dorm" is misleading and plain dumb. The place has MOLD AND STINKS — IT'S NOT NEW!!!!

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.hey guys,

does brown give away some free merch like t-shirt or something. i really wanna wear something but kinda cant afford those expensive things they got at the store. i know my friends at cornell got a free tshirt, does brown have something similiar?My partner and I will be moving out to Providence in late August to attend grad school at Brown and RISD and are looking for a one bedroom apartment if possible. We live in the Midwest so we won’t be able to see if before we sign more than likely. We’re really having a difficult time finding places in the $1,000-$1,500 range in a safe neighborhood. If anyone knows of anything let us know! Thanks!Hi! I'm looking for 1 roommate in a 3 bed 1 bath apartment at 343 Thayer St for the summer (June 1 - September 1). Rent is $800 and negotiable! This includes utility, furnishing, in-unit laundry, and a great location near CVS, Insomnia, and the Nelson Fitness Center. Please let me know if you are interested or if you have any friends still searching for a place to stay (the time period is also negotiable if you are  arriving later than June 1)! Roommates would be male-identifying.Hey! I’m a grad student who’s interested in taking German at Brown. However, I’m more interested in passively taking it (or auditing max) instead. 

Does anyone know if we can just sit in the class without enrolling?

Thanks!Hi, this should be just for entertainment~ I am curious about how you think of Brown. Try to share anything about Brown that you found out to be really interesting or unique. Could be some fun facts, recommended courses, and anything else>Is anyone else traveling to see harry styles in NY on sep 10? i got tickets but i don’t know how feasible it will be bc on the academic calendar it says classes start on the 7th. Do u guys think it will be possible? Thanks so much and sorry if this post isn’t Brown-related enough, i wasn’t sureHi, I am an international student from Beijing, China. I am now in Grade 11, applying this year! I am going to choose Brown as my ED1 school. Currently, I am working on my 2min video portfolio for Brown. Brown is the school that I love most and I feel like I fit in, but I am still feeling a little bit worried and anxious about my application. Any advices from those who have already being accepted? Or simply if you want to pm and chat with me?I recently sent in my gap year request form and have some questions. If anyone has requested a gap year before, please pm. Thanks!I am from India and will be joining from August. I need to know about budget accomodation arrangements nearby the University. I need to know right from the basics. ThanksTitle, I want to learn more about what are the best places to check off on Thayer St and where I’ll be spending most of my food money on lol(not sure if this will get taken down because it’s not relevant or too long)

hello! although i know that ultimately this decision will be mine to make, i wanted to hop in to gauge some opinions. 

i’m currently a freshman at UCSD double majoring in  cognitive science design and computer art, and was fortunate enough to have been accepted to Brown. 

i hadn’t expected to like UCSD as much as i ended up doing so, but i’d been on the waitlist for Brown as a freshman applicant, and decided to apply to a few schools for transfer not expecting much. the quality of life in san diego is incomparablely wonderful, and i’d felt like i had really found my group of people in the beginning of the year. 

some more background academically: i want to eventually go into the tech field as a UX/UI designer, and think UCSD could equip me with the technical skills to achieve that. but, my main academic reason for transferring was that i also wanted to pursue an independent branch of tech, which is more ethical design and tech, which i feel like some of the theory heavy courses of Brown could benefit me with.

thoughts on UCSD:

pros:
one of the major draws of UCSD for me is that i can graduate in 3 years total with a two degrees (bs/ba) and a minor, saving me a whole year of out of state tuition. on top of that, again, quality of life: stunning weather, the best dorms and buildings in my college, and just amazing things to do near campus. 

cons:
that being said, i’d only be living on campus for one more year, and would eventually have to move out on my own in san diego, foregoing much of that immediate quality of life. additionally, UCSD’s size makes it really hard to form more meaningful connections with professors, and the colleges themselves can often feel segregated. i also feel like because of that difficulty in forming meaningful relationship, im just another designer produced out of the UCSD factory, where i have faith i can get a standard, well paying job, but won’t have much opportunity to sort of explore the niches that i’m really trying to break into. socially as well, i don’t feel as though i’m leaving much of a community behind, as i was very gradually isolated from the friendgroup in the middle of the year (which is natural ofc!). but yeah a lot of the people i’ve met seem to have existing ties from thruout california, making it a little harder to form new connections as an out of state sometimes, and by the time i graduate college, i’ll only have a handful of friends on the east coast, where i had hoped to originally end up working (but am honestly now unsure).

thoughts on Brown:

pros:
i have always been and still am extremely drawn to Brown for their curriculum and overall approach towards education, and am super excited about a lot of the opportunities i’d want to take advantage of. their open curriculum paves way for a lot of exploring and i’m excited to finally have the chance to take philosophy and ethics classes to really round me out, because while i like learning what i am at UCSD, i feel like i’m neglecting a lot of potential learnings i could get. 
in general tho, everyone i’ve met at brown also just seems really warm and happy and passionate about what they’re doing and id love to be supported and to support that energy.

cons:
as mentioned, i’d have to spend 3 years there (bringing me to a total 4 years of undergraduate education and an extra year of tuition in comparison to ucsd), and i want to double concentrate too, which means that i’d have to squeeze an extra class each semester until my senior year. this in itself is not a huge problem because i’m already taking extra classes each quarter at UCSD, but i’m scared it would limit the opportunities i might have to explore the open curriculum, because i would be solely filling out concentration requirements. another option i was looking at was independent concentration so that i could truly integrate design, cognition and ethics, but that is definitely a complicated route to get everything approved. socially, i am also a little nervous because i’m scared i won’t make friends as a transfer outside of my fellow transfers (which congrats to them too!!). i’ve heard that it’s definitely something you make of it, but just a little self conscious i think :(

in either regard, i’m extremely lucky to be already attending a good school and to have even had the option to choose another great school. thanks for reading through and would really appreciate some feedback!! :)I’ve heard different opinions. Google says that Brown doesn’t let students view their admission file, but some students have said that this isn’t true.Researchers at the University of Michigan School of Information are conducting interviews to understand how students make sense of the college admissions process.

This post has received mod approval (thank you!).Hi! Im a rising freshman here! When do we usually have to choose our classes for the first semester?Any advice on beginner German Classes at Brown? Which profs are recommended? Workload?Did anyone get an invite for phi beta kappa? Is it worth it to join?I am looking for someone who would be willing to sublet my room in a house on Waterman St. for this summer. It is a great location across from the Sci-Li in the middle of campus. I need someone to stay there from June-August, but the dates are flexible. The rent is also negotiable as I just need to fill this place.Hi, posting this here because we are pretty desperately trying to find people to sublet two rooms in our apartment on pitman st. Rent is around 850 each but we’d be willing to negotiate! Hmu if you are interested and want to hear more!Hey guys! I'm an incoming freshman and have been looking into Orthodox Christianity lately. There are not many to no orthodox Christian resources on campus, so I was wondering if anyone on here had any tips or suggestions on navigating Orthodoxy while at Brown or RI in general. Thank you!CS173 is offered in the Fall only. I want to know about the experiences of students who have taken it in the past?

How helpful was it in your career as a programmer or a CS student? And also the amount of tangible skills gained from the course.Can I apply for the plme as an international student needing a full ride or just Brown pre-med?? (Class of '27)Hey!

I am filling in my OISSS profile and it ask me to submit an admissions letter and financial aid award letter. How may I obtain them in pdf?

&#x200B;Is anyone doing the data science masters program as a 5th year? I don’t know anyone else in the program and want to get to know some people!Hello,

I’m not a student but I might be coming to Brown to work as an RA for the summer precollege program and I need some help on navigating resources on campus.Hi,

I was accepted to Brown during regular decisions. I'm wondering how I can request to take a gap year. I don't see any form on the portal.

Thanks!How do I get the email signature that most other students have with the seal and my degree?Hi everyone! Incoming freshman here. As the title suggests the AP French exam is tomorrow and I doubt that I'm going to do well. In the best-case scenario I might get a 3 worse case probably a 1. Can I get in any trouble for that if I report the score? If it turned out lower than a 3 can I just cancel and not report it if I already said I'll be taking it on the CommonApp? For reference I took 9 AP Exams this year and probably got a 5 on 6-7 of them. Also for some context, my French grade over 4 years of high school has been >97 (our teacher gave a lot of presentations which I do well on with preparation), so I'm kind of scared they might think this as an inconsistency? Thanks in advance to everyone.

Edit: Just realized Brown has on their website that they require at least 3 years and recommend 4 years of foreign language in high school. Would the 1 / no score make them think I didn't satisfy the requirement?I'm an incoming '26 and I LOVE  languages. I intend to learn two new ones by the time I graduate, and I'd like  to start my freshman year by diving into one, but I can't decide between Japanese, Italian, Korean and Mandarin - they're all so appealing. Obviously the actual language I choose depends on a variety of things, but I was wondering if anyone could share some info on which language teachers/classes at brown are the most loved or hated by students, or any other info that could help me decide. Thanks!! :)Are there any prerequisites to declaring the CS Major? Currently an accepted junior transfer and saw I would need to declare my major as soon as I get in. I applied as an undeclared and am coming from a chemistry major (I transferred bc my school didn’t offer CS major).I'm really trying to get off the waitlist. are there any small programs I may not find in my research that I could mention (i'm interested in international politics) or programs that Brown is specifically proud of that they'd like to hear I like?Anyone know if there’s a transfer Discord? If not I don’t mind making one lolhello everyone!! I have a general question, as a first gen BIPOC student going to brown will put me in a place where i’d be eating foods that i’m not used to in the lunch halls. however is there a way to cook your own foods somewhere on campus?hey everyone, if I took multivariable calculus and linear algebra at my high school, is there a way for me to place out of those at Brown?   


would it be a test or just up to advisor discretion to let me out? is there anyone I can email for a chat/a  test?  


thanks in advance!Hi everyone! I'm looking for roommates with whom I can share an apartment. I have an internship at Hasbro and would love to stay around with some grad/undergrad students.

Anyone know if I’ll have access to a piano anywhere on campus?Thinking of taking econ 1090 (intro to game theory) this summer - what do people think about the class or  professor Geoffroy De Clippel? Hows the courseload and would it be too fast or intense over the summer?If anyone is looking for summer housing, I am subletting a room at 116 Waterman St. (across from the SciLi).
