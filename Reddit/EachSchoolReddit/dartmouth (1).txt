C/o 2026 Regular Decision MegathreadCongrats to everyone who been admitted for the class of 2026! We've created this thread for you to meet each other, ask questions to the rest of the community, and to celebrate!

For those looking before decisions have been released, please do not speculate or post about things like documents changing in your dashboard. Nobody benefits from this guesswork, and your real decision will come soon enough!What I wrote earlier about Dartmouth - just copying and pasting as it is chaotic right now.  
  
1. Similar to Princeton, they focus on undergraduate education, which is why they have the highest alumni donation rate and is honored year after year for their alumni network  
  
2. They’re consistently one of the highest awarding within the Ivy League for financial aid  
  
3. Their undergraduate economics and government program ranked top 5 in the nation with millions invested and committed to advance their STEM departments (I believe they recently finished construction on their multi-hundred million engineering building)  
  
4. Per capita, Dartmouth is third behind Wharton and Harvard in terms of sending students to top finance and consulting firms  
  
5. Flexible undergraduate curriculum similar to Brown  
  
6. Their “sophomore summer” program allows individual grades to experience Dartmouth among their cohort and is often cited as students’ favorite memory of Dartmouth  
  
7. They own the 2nd most land after the state government in both Vermont and New Hampshire, granted by the colonial state governments  
  
8. Their Greek life is often deemed progressive due to the amount of houses, including those for LGBTQ , non-binary, etc, and their generous financial aid and rules deeming that every house must be open to visitors for parties without cost or restriction  
  
Let me know if you all think a blurb of other Ivies would be helpful.Congratulations, all! 

Welcome to the Dartmouth Family :)Congrats everyone!Took you people long enough! Early Decision gang.Ok not necessarily today but yk ThursdayJust got in hahaHere's the class of 2026 discord server, it has ED, QB, and biggreen10 <3 

[https://discord.gg/XmtZTrvvkk](https://discord.gg/XmtZTrvvkk)So Sorry. Does that mean Wait List is closed? I hope you landed somewhere you love.i guess the person was rejected RD. no news about waitlist being closed yetRejected!Ok not necessarily today but yk Thursdayi guess the person was rejected RD. no news about waitlist being closed yetSo Sorry. Does that mean Wait List is closed? I hope you landed somewhere you love.i guess the person was rejected RD. no news about waitlist being closed yetSkateboarding?I’m a ‘26 and was wondering if skateboarding is a solid mode of transport across campus. Do most people walk? Would I be better off with a bike instead?I use a longboard. Bikes and electric scooters are really popular. I do disagree with ^^ though, campus is relatively small I think. The longest walk you can probably have is like 15 minutes.I rode a skateboard around campus for a few terms. It's a nice way to get around, but is pretty useless in the winter. Although most things besides walking are useless in the winter. You can bike, but it can be unpleasantLots of people have skateboards and bikes and electric scooters and whatever else to get around. Others walk everywhere. It's preference, but probably useful to have a type of transportation as the campus is large.Probably not feasible in the snow. During the one week without knee deep snow in the whole year you’ll be fineThere is a skatepark in LebanonWould any current Dartmouth student mind sharing their resume?I'm so confused about what to put in the resume for my commonapp applicn. Does it have to be a one-page record or a multi-page creative presentation. Samples would help.

Thanks, guys!Really don’t need a resume unless there’s something significant that isn’t on the rest of your application. I don’t think Dartmouth even lets you upload oneYou don’t need to attach a resumé? Isn’t it an optional extra?It should be a one page record that is similar to the professional ones you see online for jobsI would include it because if nothing else, it shows you cared enough to make and show it. One page, standard resume should do the trickChange in Dartmouth acceptance rate in 2023?Given than Dartmouth has gone need blind, is there going to be a dramatic decrease in acceptance rate for intls?   Is there also going to be a change in domestic acceptance rates?Dartmouth was already need blind for domestic.For internationals that’s likely.NoDartmouth BoundDoes anyone know when results for the Dartmouth Bound applications get posted?Alr ty !I applied and my friend told me that results usually come out before June 10thThey got back to me yesterday. Here’s the email.

Dear [My Name], 

Thank you for your email. We hope to release Bound decisions in the next 10 days.

Stay tuned!
Undergraduate Admissions OfficeAlr ty !Disappearing LLCsThe LLC application has disappeared in the darthub website - incoming freshmen can't apply to them anymore. Anyone know why it happened before the stated deadline of June 8th though?I’m having the same problem. There’s just a blank space where the application link used to be.This should have been fixed! If you keep having trouble, you can always email residential.life@dartmouth.edu ☺️What do you do with bikes when away from campus?Are there long term storage options? Do you just leave them locked up? What do you do with them over winter?

Particularly interested in these questions from an international student POV.

Thanks!you can store them the same way you store other stuff on campus when you leave but putting them in controlled storage (https://www.dartmouth.edu/res-ops/storage.options/controlledstorage.html) and at least my building has a bike room in the basement where i put my bike during the winter. if you leave your bike locked up outside for too long it will get taken and donated to dartmouth bikes.Maths Placement for Further Maths A levelHey I can’t seem to find any info about placement for further maths A level (only A level maths). Does anyone know what the automatic placement is? And if it is the same as A level Maths (placed into Math 8) how hard is the placement test and what class would you recommend placing into between 9/11/13.HELP!! TUCK002 need different section!anyone enrolled in TUCK02: Principles of Marketing looking to swap sections?

thank you so much!!Question About NRO for Econ MajorThe registrar website states that NRO can't be used towards the major but can be used towards prereqs for the major...does this mean I can NRO Econ1?Yes certain departments do not allow any courses or most courses to be NRO'd.  For ECON you can only NRO Econ 2, which doesn't count for the major and is also pretty easy anyway.Econ 1 can't be NROd in any caseEcon1 is a major course so I don’t think you can NRO itYes certain departments do not allow any courses or most courses to be NRO'd.  For ECON you can only NRO Econ 2, which doesn't count for the major and is also pretty easy anyway.International student packing listWhat should international students pack from home? What are some things that I should buy when I arrive instead? Do you arrive early to buy some dorm essentials or afterwards?Thanks for your help! When will I know my shipping address?it comes with your room assignment!i’m not an international student but i had to fly across the country to dartmouth and i remember shipping packages directly from the website i ordered them from (stuff like bedding) to my dartmouth shipping address and then i just picked them up once i arrived. toiletries i bought at stores near hanover but since some were sold out with all of the pre-college purchasing you might be able to ship toiletries to yourself tooWould recommend ordering bedding a few days/even a week before u arrive. The first day, I had to use my jackets as blankets HAHA aside from that though, you definitely don't need to bring much aside from clothes and any personal items you want to bring. Most things you can buy, but if you think those might be expensive here then I would recommend packing them in if they're not too heavy. As for clothes, the weather here varies a fair bit so just having different layers (thin-ish ones are fine as long as you can layer multiple when it's cold) and jackets e.g. rain coat, hoodie, maybe warmer jacket though you can buy it here if it's too bulky.it comes with your room assignment!Thanks for your help! When will I know my shipping address?it comes with your room assignment!Did you lose an Apple Watch?I found an Apple Watch during my visit. If you lost one and can describe it, I would be more than happy to ship it back to you.The apple stores won’t do anything.  

Mail it to the campus list and found.Go to your local apple store, they can probably track the owner downThe apple stores won’t do anything.

I’ve read that there’s some sort of stigma against macs but what do you guys think? Anyone have any recommendations?You will have no regrets if you get a 14 inch MacBook ProAs a CS Major, Mac is super helpful. Half the profs (even non CS) don’t even know how to use windowsA Mac. No clue about BME, but I’m a qss major and you’re going to want a Mac.I'm thinking about qss and geog and in the same position as op could you say why Mac?Most seamless operating system. Vast majority of students and professors here (not just Qss) use macs. Therefore, they’re going to assume you have one. Not to say that windows won’t work, but they’re going to have to go out of their way to figure out things for your computer. It’s just better to have a Mac. Trust. 

Also, not saying that you can’t do it, but be prepared to think about your majors and your plan. Because QSS is interdisciplinary, it’s course intensive meaning that there might not be enough space for you to double major. That’s just my experience. Most Qss minor in Cs or double

You’d have to relate how the courses you would take in WGSS are relevant to Econ, but you could do it.  If you wanna deeply explore both of them separately, minor or double major.okay thank you! :)Not very hard if you can state a rationale.How hard is it usually to get it approved?Not very hard if you can state a rationale.walk on to rowing?i’m a ‘26 interested in women’s rowing @dartmouth… and no prior rowing experience:) 

anyone familiar w the feasibility of the walk on process?Extremely feasiblethank u so much!!Very feasible. Crew as a sport is known for having people join with no experience and then gone on to row at the Olympics. 

Keep an eye out early fall term and they’ll have info sessions for Novice rowers. It’s a great time to try it out. 

It is an incredibly beautiful place to row and the boathouse was recently renovated. It can also be an incredibly cold place to row. Pack long Spandex. :)ty!ayo :) rowing seems really fun! lmk if you walk on, i’m cheering for you!yeah of course:)Hey I’m interested in this as well. Can I PM youthank u so much!!ty!yeah of course:)For transfer students: When did you get your transfer evaluation tab?For transfer students... when were you able to know when and what transfer credits were transferable?thanks! Was there any way we could know earlier?nopeYou could always reach out to the registrar about it but not sure if they would expedite it since everyone is likely in the same boat anyway. I would just hope that they’ve committed to releasing it earlier for everyoneA few days before course selection during orientation, when we were all on campus already.nopeYou could always reach out to the registrar about it but not sure if they would expedite it since everyone is likely in the same boat anyway.

I'm looking for a 2 bedroom or equivalent size, off campus and pet friendly, budget is under 3k. Ideally close to green spaces for the dog. Any of the surrounding towns works for us. Thanks!For the Spanish lsa+, is the application process competitive and do you have to be fluent when you apply?Also, is there an interview-type thing in the app process?Thoughts on the Individual Instruction Program?I’ve played the piano the last 2.5 years or so, and I’m a ‘26. I’d like to continue this, but I’d say I hover around an intermediate skill level. Is there an expectation of how good a student should be to enroll in this program? Do IIP students—especially piano students—recommend it? How has your experience been? What should I expect? I don’t intend to major in music, it’s just something that is important to me. 
Thanks!do you know how long the lessons are? i took violin lessons throughout high school so im wondering how similar it will be to that.1 hourI think it’s once a week for three terms and then it counts as a fourth class your spring term. I have heard great things but that it’s a commitment. Once a week might not feel like a lot but your days will be packed. Just something to consider1 hourdo you know how long the lessons are? i took violin lessons throughout high school so im wondering how similar it will be to that.1 hourLeast competitive major at Dartmouth for undergrad?Hey guys, I m aspiring to apply to dartmouth for undergraduate I would like to know which major is the easiest to get into because I have heard that computer science and social studies majors are extremely competitive.
So what are the majors with the highest acceptance rate if someone has got the data or can make a perfect estimate?But we have to choose the intended area of a study in commonapp college applicationYes, but that doesn't lock you into anything.Dartmouth doesn't admit by major. You actually don't even declare it until the later part of sophomore year.dartmouth (and the other ivies) dont admit by major, so it won't affect your admission decision at all. 

also, dartmouth really values fit, so they tend to easily filter out people who only apply for the ivy prestige/game the system to get in. 

the mentality of the student body is very work hard, play hard, so the school isn't a great fit socially for extremely academic-oriented students. its fairly taboo to talk about academics (things like comparing gpa, test scores, etc...) in social circles here.The thing is my class 11th is PCM means I am a physics chemistry maths student but my extraorichues are related to social science so I am confused what to apply for computer science or government or some you know political degreeIt sounds like you have a pretty well rounded profile. In that case, you should put whatever major interests you.Also my SAT score is 1440 with 680 in reading n writing and 760 in mathsActually my extra curriculus are related to social science and my sat maths scorel is 760 reading and writing score is 680 but it the same time I can also propose a project for computer science th
o I don't have any extra curriculars in it so I confused what to choose computer science or political scienceHowever I have a good idea to relate my social science extra curriclose with computer science and I have a project in mind which I can propose for computer science but at the same time my extra curriculars are related to social science and that's what makes it so confusing for meYou're massively overthinking it. When I say that the academic interest you put doesn't matter much, I mean it doesn't matter much.Why do you want to go to university?  Why specifically do you want to go to Dartmouth?  What value do you believe you can add to the Dartmouth community?  I'd be much more worried about being able to clearly articulate those points than applying to the 'easiest' major.  To echo other's points the major does NOT matter.  Showing that you genuinely have something to offer and can show why you would matriculate if lucky enough to be accepted does.‘24 here, I’d recommend you say you want to study business. I know literally 0 business majors, definitely the least competitive, good luck!!Well I am sorry do you have annoyed you but my primary extra curricular is debate. So if it could help you with advising which one would be better for me?Oh thanks for taking the time to reply your reply did satiate my curiosity. thank you.😂😂Good one 😂Woww that's hard to believe..you from Dartmouth?The. major. you. put. on. your. application. does. not. matter.Yeah, u/biggreen10 is right - since you can choose whatever major you want when you apply and change later without any oversight, the major you choose won’t have too much bearing on your admission. In reality, though, your high school classes and ec’s should suggest what major to apply as - applying for a major that might be regarded as easy to get into (hospitality) with no experience or extracurriculars in that field would probably have a lower chance of acceptance than applying as a major in a field your classes and ecs demonstrate interest in.You don't apply to a major and it doesn't matter for admissions other than I think a few of the math intended admits get Jack Byrne scholar distinctions. I think most everyone at Dartmouth is capable enough to successfully complete any of the majors offered here with enough determination and interest. We just have our own unique interests and goals. I applied as an undecided major because I legit did not know what I wanted to study after high school. You will have to show to Admissions that you are an excellent student capable of studying and exploring academically at Dartmouth. What you intend on majoring (on the common app) doesn't matter because your interests and course plans will likely change while attending Dartmouth.Yes, but that doesn't lock you into anything.But we have to choose the intended area of a study in commonapp college applicationIt sounds like you have a pretty well rounded profile.

WHATS THE RECOMMENDED WORD LIMIT FOR THE ESSAY QUESTIONS FOR THE LLCs?Idk but I just wrote a like 2 paragraphsAt least in Foley we would all read all the apps so for the love of all things high and holy don’t make it too longI emailed the LLCs email and IG but no responseTry res ops residential.operations@dartmouth.eduEmail res ops and askTry res ops residential.operations@dartmouth.eduI emailed the LLCs email and IG but no responseTry res ops residential.operations@dartmouth.eduAny competitions being hosted this summer at Dartmouth?So yeah, an Indian out here, applying ED to Dartmouth for polisci.....any competitions up I could participate in this summer (till August 1)? Could be related to writing, debating et al. 

Thanks, mates!What's the Directed Self-Placement process like for freshman writing courses?Incoming '26 here. Was just wondering what the self-placement process looks like. I know you've got to read and construct an argumentative essay of sorts but I'm not really sure. What is it like specifically?

(Also, could yall just add what writing course y'all chose and why? Is it worth going through the writing 5 rigour?)I took humanities 1 and 2. I wanted to be challenged and got the chance to read cool and intriguing texts. However, I would advise you to take humanities 1 and then switch to a writing 5 class because hum 2 was boring af with a couple of the readings being like 120 pages of a philosopher's wet dream. If you are into that kind of stuff props to you but I would take hum 1 then switch out. Congrats and welcome to Dartmouth. Heres a link for more info. 

[https://www.dartmouth.edu/hums1-2/](https://www.dartmouth.edu/hums1-2/)Thank you! Do you have any idea what the essay-type test actually entails?do you know how many terms hum 1 is?Not really…I saw it when it opened last year but I didn’t really look over it. I think it will open on canvas like June 1st or something. You’ll have plenty of time to do it if you want to. It’s one of the pre-arrival stepsIt’s pretty standard. Read one or two articles about a topic, write an essay. They give u a word count. For the past two years, it’s been about liberal arts vs stem based education. But take a writing 5 course if you’re able! Writing 2-3 is a three term commitment whereas writing 5 is two. Therefore, you can take an additional class of your interest.Hum 1 is one term and Hum 2 one term. Hum 1 satisfies the writing req and Hum 2 satisfies the seminar reqthanks!Wassup!! Also a ‘26 (deferred from ‘25), but Writing 5 is like the regular course most 1st years take. I’ve heard lots of good things about the course especially since there are a lot of different topics that are offered. Writing 2-3 is more of a focused/remedial course for those who don’t feel as confident and maybe come in with less ability. Hum 1 is an intensive writing course that goes through a lot more material and has greater workload. So if you are comfortable with your writing and don’t want the more intensive workload you’d probs go for Writ 5, if you want an intensive study/discussion based class ab classics in lit Hum 1 is cool. If you want more help with your writing going into college and don’t have lots of experience/confidence the you’ll probs want to go for Writ 2-3. A lot is self selection although I think there is a write on essay-type test for the Hum courses.Def take writing 5 unless you feel that your writing background is very weakJust take Writ 5 if you're just looking to satisfy the writing requirement. It (depending on which section you choose) is a pretty chill class in comparison to the other options and should be an easy A/A-. Also, don't stress too much about the placement essay (like I did) if you want to do Writ 5, as I think it's the default placement. My friend never even submitted the essay and got put in it.i was a ‘25, never did my placement and did writing 5It’s pretty standard. Read one or two articles about a topic, write an essay.

Is there any advice you'd like to give regarding applying early? Could be anything substantial. I'll really appreciate it!Try to have excellent GPA and test scores (>1550).
These will help you to a great extent. And show your love for Dartmouth traditions through your essays.
Other than these, i don't think there's any secret formula.Dartmouth has a really really strong sense of community so show how you'd fit into that. Oh and those teacher recs are 🤌 importantBasically the same tips as any other top school, along with making sure your peer writer is competent. Like any other T20/Ivy admissions are mostly up to chance at this level and even with a flawless application, most of your decision is out of your control.ThisBe authentic! It’s so easy to tell a genuine essay apart from others. And remember that people will have differing opinions on your essay, so be the chief cook in the kitchenWhen you write the “why Dartmouth” essay, make sure that EVERY sentence directly relates to Dartmouth and why you want to go there. If a sentence could be copy pasted to another schools prompt, it needs to be changed. 100 words isn’t a lot, so you need to use them wisely!

Also this advice goes for any “why this school” prompt :))Do you know about any humanities-related research that's being done at Dartmouth but not any other part of the country?Also, where do I find this info for 'research that is being done nowhere else in the country, except Dartmouth?'

I can come across two possible places:

1. Through the department directory for my intended major at Dartmouth (their Dartmouth profiles list their individual research projects -- mostly books or articles that **most** academic people write, hence I see no particular stuff that stands out to me as "exceptional" ifykwim)
2. Through the general research websiteI suppose this only really works for sciencey majors?? I was writing about Earth Science and remember mentioning one of the laboratories and the professor who worked there and how that type of lab was the only one of its kind in the country. I found it on the "Labs and Facilities" part of the earth science department website. Do keep in mind the website never said it is the only one in the country, but I was quite confident it was. It had a very specific and unique sounding name I guess, and it related very closely to what I had worked on in high school Check out the page I am talking about and hopefully it makes more sense:

https://earthsciences.dartmouth.edu/research/labs-facilitiesSee if you can write about a laboratory, program, or research that is being done nowhere else in the country, except Dartmouth, in your supplemental essay.Use you 100-word Why Dartmouth supplement wisely. Talk about something Dartmouth-specific like the D-Plan, Outing Club, or tight-knit community that appeals to you! 

Have a strong GPA and high class rank with test scores at or above the 75th percentile. Have stellar ECs with several awards to supplement your success; distinction at a national or international level always lets you stand out.I am an international :(These are all great recommendations. If it is not too late already apply for the fly-in program. I am a NAD (Native American at Dartmouth) and they have Indigenous fly-in and the other one for prospective students. This will pretty much guarantee admission; especially if you apply ED. Also they pay for everything so do not worry about finances.ThisDo you know about any humanities-related research that's being done at Dartmouth but not any other part of the country?I suppose this only really works for sciencey majors??

I want to double major in English/Comparative Lit. + Philosophy/Film and minor in German/or any other cool lang. Can I still opt for a creative writing concentration?[creative writing concentration- Dartmouth ](https://english.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/creative-writing-concentration#:~:text=The%20Creative%20Writing%20Program's%20sequential,literature%20from%20a%20writer's%20perspective.)

Can you explain me if this a part of the English major or is it something separate? I am so sorry, I am unaware of how the course structure works.Can you elucidate on the distribution requirements? What does that mean?There are concentration tracks in some majors like Engineering B.E. and English but isn't available for most majors.It is part of it.

I was a double major in film/media studies and English with a creative writing concentration. Totally doable, it’s a part of the English major with specific classes attached to itDartmouth is a liberal arts school and therefore requires you to take a class that covers a certain area of education (engineering, science, eastern/wester culture, literature…). Although it’s only ~9 classes it’s something to keep in mind. I personally enjoyed getting pushed beyond my boundaries of what I wanted to learn!

They can double as classes for you major though.

I promise just a few, I'm really curious!This is fair - I’m premed and a neuroscience thesis student and am therefore very restricted to the sciences/one major. I was unaware of these possibilities - my fault!I remember reading about the distribution requirements on the website but I just wanted someone else to confirm it for me --- weird I know. Anyway, thanks for the detailed response! I really appreciate it :)Dartmouth doesn’t have anything under the lines of “concentration”, but you can do two minors. You can also modify a major to encompass multiple studies. That sounds like a cool plan but one thing to keep in mind with dartmouth is you have distributive requirements (~9 classes) so that’s quite a lot of things. I only know of about 2-3 people (I’m a senior) who have successfully completed a double major + minorI think so because the concentration doesn’t add extra classes you need for the major, just 4 of your English classes have to be Creative writing tooCreative Writing is a track within English major so yes you can do that as long as you are declaring English as a major regardless of whatever double major or minor you do. You just have to take some courses that are 'concentrated' in CWRT as part of your English major course selection.

\- Also, consider the modified major options or even the special 'create your own major' option as 2 majors + another minor is like 26 courses of the 35 or so you'll take not including 9 distribs. It's doable but leaves you with less flexibility with scheduling as not all the courses are offered every term or sometimes every year.

[https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/academics/custom-majors](https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/academics/custom-majors)The English department is currently working on establishing a creative writing minor. Not sure when it will be instituted, but I think soon if I had to guess. The English department just got a large surplus of money from the endowment to expand. Email the department chair and ask if you are really curious! They would be more than happy to talk to you about it.You can also modify your majors or create your own majors, which go through an appeals process.

Many comparative literature majors also have a language focus and include another field, like film or philosophy, which might be the best option. 

As you add majors or minors, you reduce the number of classes you can take or want to take outside of your field of study, which is a huge upside to liberal art colleges. I double majored, and I found that I couldn't take many fun/educational courses outside of my field that would have made me a more well-rounded student. You can try and plan very carefully, but you will have to sacrifice taking classes that might interest you because of schedules.It is part of it. English major consists of \~ 10 ENGL or CRWT courses.

Anyway, thanks for the detailed response! I really appreciate it :)to LLC or not to LLC?incoming ‘26 primarily interested in the entrepreneurship LLC. 

i live the idea of the program, and the McLaughlin dorms seem cool, but idk if i’d feel like i was missing out on the rest of dorm culture @ dartmouth. 

is it worth it to join an LLC? What house are u sorted into if u decide to leave the LLC sophomore year? what are the stereotypes associated w LLC students?

also, how hard is it to get in?!

any and all advice/personal input is welcome!!!My daughter entered in an LLC in '16. Can't remember which. Said she felt not as connected to the first years who had a 'more typical' experience (which she more than overcame, but still). One data point.Nicer dorms if you're in McLaughlin but disconnected as mentioned from the majority of other freshman.thanks so much! 

was it worth it in ur opinion? how were the people/opportunities?I personally thought it was worth it. Met some awesome people and had some cool perks like dinners and stuff.I was in an LLC my first year. Everyone will envy your dorm because it is really nice and has a private bathroom and shower. Although you will miss out on the rest of the freshman dorm culture if you are not super out going. I wasn’t much of a party person so I didn’t mind it. Also as far as I am aware, you still are put into one of the house communities even though you are in an LLC, you just won’t live with the rest of your house though cause you’ll be in the LLC, which kind of sucks. Honestly I kind of just bs’d my essays and got in so I can’t imagine they are too competitive for freshman. They are more competitive if you apply after freshman year though as most people I met didn’t realize you get nicer dorms. Most people leave the LLC after freshman year though from my experience.

Also you’ll only really be missing out on the freshman dorm culture with an LLC. As you know Greek life is huge at Dartmouth so whether or not you join a frat or sorority sophomore year matters more.Dorm culture really only exists for Freshmen because D-Plan and upperclassmen are busy with ECs, job search, and internships to have time to make friends with dorm neighbors. LLCs are a mix of students of all class years. If you want the normal freshmen experience then just do the regular dorm.

First year dorm floors can get pretty close and the UGA helps with that with weekly meetings/events and the fact that freshmen are on campus for three consecutive terms. Upperclassmen dorms are not that close usually because people are coming and going with the D-Plan and people already have their set routines and friends.

Can always do LLC during your upperclass years.Also, one question from me is how long should our essay responses be for the LLC apps? How many words?I personally thought it was worth it. Met some awesome people and had some cool perks like dinners and stuff.thanks so much! 

was it worth it in ur opinion? how were the people/opportunities?I personally thought it was worth it. Met some awesome people and had some cool perks like dinners and stuff.how do i get involved in research?Hi all! im transferring to D in the fall and want to jump right in to research. Is there a process I should follow? Do students tend to join ongoing research or create their own?Check out UGAR’s websiteFirst, ask any friends and upperclassmen how they did it. 
Second, ask professors that you know if they have research opportunities.
Third, email everyone in the department you’re interested in. The worst they can do is say no.I just emailed a prof that was doing research I was interested in and they set up a short meeting about projects available and my interests and goals. Many talk to the profs of classes they're taking about what research they do.. and that leads to research opportunities naturally. Profs are very open to undergrad researchers here and most will even give freshmen a chance to learn on the job. 

There are also research listings and databases available to Dartmouth students to search available RA positions and also resources available through Presidential, Neukom, WISP scholars and other on-campus funded grant programs.. that will link you to profs looking for undergrad assistants.if you are a woman, look into the WISP program. Takes place in the fall and you get matched into a labAny Dartmouth student with approx 1440 on SAT (and not in athletics)?I only had a 1410 and was accepted for Class of 2026!Very few, if at all. Get a 1530 or 35 to maximise your oddsI had a 32 (which is about a 1440 or lower even) on the ACT and a few lower takes of the SAT and ACT. And I got in with the class of 2025I had a 1400 and was accepted into the class of 2026 but turned it down for Upenn!early decision?nope! rd!amazing essays?I mean they were decent but that’s up to interpretation hahaAnd tbh my common app essay was less than 300 words LOL. Sometimes less is more 🤓indeed!I didn’t submit test scores and got into the class of 2026! no athletics either :-)I would apply test optional with a 1440 as an Indian international. Even though some of the other comments may have you convinced that a 1440 is good enough, it’s barely 25th percentile according to the class of 25 profile, and you have to consider that the median is impacted by athletes and legacies as well. It sucks but, internationals (especially Indian ones), are held to a higher standard in the admissions process and a 1440 won’t help in the slightest. That’s not to say it’s impossible for you to get in with that score, just that you would rather go test optional at that point since it’s definitely not helping.nope! rd!amazing essays?I mean they were decent but that’s up to interpretation hahaAnd tbh my common app essay was less than 300 words LOL.

I was curious about substance free housing because it seems appealing to me but I thought there might be a stigma with it or a bunch of people whose parents signed them up for it and don't really want to be substance free. Does anyone here have any thoughts on it (as someone who has done it or is an outsider)?When I was a student I was in sub free every year and loved it. There was no stigma because most people wouldn't know you were in sub free unless you told them. I really liked sub free because my neighbors were quieter and more conscientious than the student body at large. You can still get drunk at other people's dorms, you just can't at yours, so if you're someone who likes throwing parties it won't be a good fit.I’m a bit older, but there was zero stigma about substance free when I was there.No stigma at all. Haven't heard about anyone in the latter case (parents signed them up).Thank you everyone for your answers, I think I will select it on my housing now.Not sure how strict it’s followed. A lot of students like it because it used to be primarily in McLaughlin, really nice dorms.it's not followed at all lmao. nothing is substance free at DartVisiting Campus Area Over the SummerHello, I am a rising sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin. I am from Dallas, TX but I’ll be spending the summer in NH since my mom lives here. I was wondering what is in the area that might allow me to potentially meet people as a non-Dartmouth student. Or, just what do you guys recommend for me to do for fun.By tours do you mean college campus tours prospective/incoming students go on?Go hiking! Swimming. So much to do. As for meeting students, tours happen over the summer and sophomores will be on campus. Ask questions, talk to people, etc.Meeting a stranger from the internet isn’t the best idea, but I feel inclined to accept this offer 😂I promise I go here lol. Kind of the best I can doYes. They might not be scheduled right now, but there will be tours over the summer. Also, I will be around this summer if you want an unofficial tour.By tours do you mean college campus tours prospective/incoming students go on?I promise I go here lol.

I have plenty of friends, go out on weekends, etc. and I shower and use the restroom in absolute luxury.Yes. Entrepreneurship LLC (or all LLCs for that matter) are in McLaughlin, which are very nice dorms on campus. That’s what makes it worth it. But we just do floor discussions and have occasional guest speakers that you have to attend.  But it’s worth it if you want to be in a nice dorm your freshman yearNot at all. I have plenty of friends, go out on weekends, etc. and I shower and use the restroom in absolute luxury.thank u! hows the social life? do u feel at all isolated from on campus culture?Not at all.

Can anyone clarify?So do they mean coed rooms when they say gender inclusive housing?I think so, but some dorms have gender inclusive bathrooms that are single use (anybody can use them). That might be what they meanThere are no gender exclusive dorms at Dartmouth. Some dorms have half baths in the rooms. Other dorms have gender inclusive bathrooms (single stall, anybody can use). That’s what they mean by gender inclusive.Most dorms have gendered bathrooms (communal, one for each gender) on each floor. Especially for freshmen.I think so, but some dorms have gender inclusive bathrooms that are single use (anybody can use them).

Good luck!What’s the Entrepreneurship LLC like?Incoming 26. Ik it was remote last year but to anyone who knows anything about it pre-COVID, what’s the general rep of it? Do most people enjoy it? Is it tougher living in McLaughlin and being somewhat isolated? What’s the general experience like and would you recommend it?First Year Trips for 26’sI know that first year trips were altered because of covid and I was wondering if they are going back to normal this year?
Also what are peoples thoughts on the altered version?i'm a trips leader this year and so far things look as if they will be progressing normallyI have no idea what trips will look like for 26s. However, I can say that due to Covid my trip experience was super mid. Our trips were shortened and we did not even get to camp outside due to this the trip bond was not all that strong. With Covid right now I would say your experience will far surpass my own because our campus has opened up. Also congratulations and welcome to Dartmouth!im involved with trips this year and its going to be the normal few days out in the woods thing that usually happenswaitlisted candidateshave you received any kind of acknowledgement that your LOCI was added to your file, or even any sort of response to your email?Thank you!

I have a few general questions though if you guys wouldn't mind answering.

The job I have gives me housing near the Co-Op but it's pretty shitty (1993 appliances) with no AC and I share the house and bathrooms with 2 30 year olds. I've looked at Dartmouth Upper Valley list plus every website I can and there is NO housing up here. I'm even willing to go up to 50% of my income and still couldn't find anything. Is that just a thing here where housing is pretty much a crapshoot? 

&#x200B;

Also since I'm 21, I'm still very much interested in meeting people my age but from what I can tell a lot of social life here is greek life based and/or restricted to students (Kyle concert, intramural sports, barbecue I was denied at, etc.). How can a 21 year old non-student meet people here? 

I also had a question about the AT bus. I have been given a parking spot in Dewey lot but that means a long walk to my office which limits the time I have for lunch. I believe that bus runs from Dewey lot to the Thompson lot (athletic fields) semi-regularly so is that an option or do I just need to get in shape and walk the mile or so?I’m the director of creative media for football programAlso check out the DOC! I am sure that they would be more than willing to accommodate.Check out Dartmouth’s bike shop- I think they have pretty cheap used bikes. It’s student run. 

And yes. Housing here sucks. Nowhere to rent and the majority of undergrad dorms are even worse than what you described. So no real way around that. 

As for a social life, I would recommend walking around campus, the gym, etc. can I ask what you’re doing?If you are willing to commute a bit you might check out housing listings on Vermont Law School's website though it's also a lean market in terms of rental optoins.  South Royalton (SoRo) is a small town but it's a direct shot to Hanover.The housing crisis is very real in the Upper Valley, especially if you want to live in Hanover. Even some professionals who work full-time for the college have to pay half their income for housing! If you talk to the food service employees here, you’ll find out that many of them have to commute as far as one hour each way. Restaurants often have to turn down customers for lack of workers.

So you’re actually pretty lucky to have Hanover housing provided to you.

As for social life: there’s one bar in town (Dunk’s) and it’s usually pretty packed on a Friday or Saturday night. Might be a place to meet both students and non-students.Also check out the DOC! I am sure that they would be more than willing to accommodate.I’m the director of creative media for football programAlso check out the DOC!

I think if one happens to get to know them it’s all good but seeking to know who attends a specific institution is just kinda weird at best 😬.I think they should have a chance to remain anonymous if they want to be. It shouldn’t matter who is a-listers or not. No need to churn the gossip mill. Here at Dartmouth, we’re all in the same boat going to the same place.Five years here and no idea of any gossip any celeb kid is here tbh some kids of politicians but I haven’t been involved in any “hype” hearing about famous people.Yeah. It just seems awkwardly low to do that…. Perhaps because it’s online but honestly if someone was asking that even in-perso it would feel weird to anyone too.I’m sure there are quite a few, but it’s not really our place to tell other people what a current student’s parents do for work on a public platform don’t you think? Even if you do want to share stories of a current student, please be vague and respectful of their privacy - keep in mind that they still go to this school. Alumini stories are fine igYeah I go here, I'm the president of the universeRoger Goodel’s kids go here but they changed their last name to blend in

Otherwise I haven’t heard of anybody tho I’m sure there aeethey're normal kids too. idk i never got the celeb hype though. they're just people.It’s definitely a bit of a weird question to ask online lol. I think if one happens to get to know them it’s all good but seeking to know who attends a specific institution is just kinda weird at best 😬.Yeah. It just seems awkwardly low to do that…. Perhaps because it’s online but honestly if someone was asking that even in-perso it would feel weird to anyone too.any advice on off-campus living? (transfer student)Start looking now and be prepared to shell out a pretty pennyLots of sketchy landlords who scam kids out of security depostis, ask around on who’s good/ not goodDo parents come to homecoming usually? Mine want to come but idk if that’s a thingYou will probably want to hang out with your friends over homecoming and may resent showing them around that weekend. Try to guide your folks to come over family weekend instead.Maybe if they are alums, but generally noThat seems like a terrible idea, depending on what kind of homecoming you plan to celebrateNo terrible idea, try to dissuade themSome parents come, but very few.Have Dartmouth 2022 transfer decisions been sent out?Hey, incoming co’26 here. Just wanted to know what all amenities/entertainment is present in the dormsTV, sparse kitchen pots and pans, might have a fuzeball table or some game boards. You really gotta just make your own fun. Hanover isn’t meant to be enjoyed indoors :)^^^ also throughout my four years here I’ve never seen someone use common room features as dining halls are all super close and most will find a friend or two that will bring a tvSome dorms have a micro fridge. But double check. And not many people stay in their dorms. I don’t get back to mine until midnight everyday.Information on next yearHi all, I'm an incoming '26. Just checking to make sure I am not missing anything - I haven't gotten any emails from Dartmouth about next year other than their emails last month regarding ways to learn about the school. I also haven't received an email about making a Dartmouth email. Is this where most people are at right now?Awesome! Thank you!i’m a 26 too and at the same place w everything! :)This stuff usually doesn’t get sent out until July.Awesome! Thank you!WaitlistedWho all got accepted from Dartmouth waitlist.?check out my post like two posts down from this oneAny one from or in Turkey currently class of 2026?to those already got off the waitlistfirst of all, congrats!! it’s hugeee

when did u guys send ur locis and how did you find this out?do you know if they accept in waves (like based on region or some other factor) or just all at once? And if waves how far apart?I honestly can’t tell. Everybody who got in from the WL so far got notified on May 5th and I haven’t seen anybody else say they got in ever since. Maybe they’re finished taking people, maybe not. Let’s just sit back and wait. That’s what we do best anyway 🥲I might email admissions to find outLet me know with any update you get! 😉I emailed them and they said we have extended few offers and we don't know whether if or when there will be more waitlist activity i dont think they will be extending any more it is such a heartbreak.Waitlist activity sometimes extends until the end of July but in Dartmouth’s case, I’m really not optimistic about it. But hey, who knows!I am not optimistic i think may 5th was the chance and that's itSaw somewhere that waitlisted applicants from last year received an email on May 6th, saying that the class was full and they weren’t taking any more students from the WL. So far, we haven’t received such notification, so my guess would probably be that they’re releasing WL decisions in waves this year. And as I said, the WL process can be extremely long. Let’s wait a few more days to see if more students get off the waitlist. In any case, good luck to y’all!Sent mine on April 25 and still anxiously waiting 🥲 wish me luck!! Good luck to y’all too!!Where did you send your LOCI?U got in .?Dartmouth admissions emailYesCongratulations.Dont mind me asking are u an international student.?I am notStats?Like 4.5 gpa W, 3.95 UWI sent mine around April 15 and they emailed me around like may 5 about my acceptance off the waitlist.Was anyone rejected? Or did everyone get this email?Sent my LOCI around April 8th or 9th. Received acceptance on May 5th. International student asking almost full aid.I am waiting i sent my loci on 19th April.Have only accepted students received an email so far? Has anyone been rejected yet?International student?I bet domesticSent mine April 15th and got off May 5th. Good luck!!I sent mine on 4/20, and got an email back on 5/5. I think 420 was the magic number..Does anyone know around how many students have been extended spots off the waitlist so far?it means that by now it’s full which means that they are very unlikely to take anyone off the WL, but in case some current prefrosh withdraws (like in case they also get off some other WL’s and choose to attend there), Darty will get some new spots availableare transfer students part of the 2026? I got waitlisted as a transfer..I see - thank you. well... I guess that's that thenNo, I don't think so.If the Class of 2026 is full what are they monitoring? 😭I'm so confusedI honestly can’t tell.

Nice, thick, fluffy, preferably weighted blankets. 
2. PILLOWS!!! Something that a lot of my freshmen floor mates forgot to bring. These are important because your bed doesn’t come with a pillow.
3. Laundry Hamper. Something that most people over look and will end up buying.
4. Slippers/shoes for showering. Had to give my freshmen roommate an extra pair that I brought with me.
5. Shower caddy 
6. A fan. For a few weeks in the year it will be very hot, and a fan will be useful especially if you will be living in one of the older dorms.
7. A bunch of wall hooks in case you want to hang some stuff up, which most people do. 
8. Extensions/Power cords.
9. Plates and silverware. For the occasions where you don’t want to have to leave your room for food. And trust me these scenarios will arrive plenty. 
10. Storage bins/containers. 
11. Minifridge and Kettle. On the days you don’t want to run to a snack bar or foco for something warm or cold, I would suggest a minifridge and a kettle

And finally, this wasn’t really a necessity but I just found it really comforting. ROBES! During the colder months, after a nice warm shower, I would snuggle up in bed in a nice, fluffy, bath robe and watched Netflix with hot coco.College Pack List

Edit: to be fair, I know that's the case for several majors but I don't know the specifics of the language requirementYes, I didn’t have any AP test credits but I was able to test out of all 3 levels of Spanish from the placement test.Ap creditfor the classes that give credit does that mean you don’t need to take the credit or you can take a different class to fill the credit but you still need to take a class? Also, does it make sense as an engineering student to place out of a calc1 or introductory physics class?Will I get Rescinded?Just gut off the Waitlist for the Class of '26. I am so nervous and excited. But I might get all C's in my final grades. I also have a valid reason. I was preparing for my country's entrance exams for colleges which is just a month away. Can I explain this to the admission officers or will it get me rescinded?Okay.Good luck and congratulations. Dartmouth is a fantastic school. You should be proudGetting all C's in your final semester sends a bad signal to the schools. Will you be resilient enough to endure the rigor and the 10-week quarter pressure at Dartmouth?
You should also ask yourself about this. Try to explain the situation to them and build a strong argument in order to avoid any trouble.Thank you. Will try doing that.I think explain your situation to them. They are not looking to rescind someone for the sake of rescinding and are generally very understanding.Good luck and congratulations. Dartmouth is a fantastic school. You should be proudOkay.Thank you. Will try doing that.Good luck and congratulations. Dartmouth is a fantastic school. You should be proudTVs; End of Term Move-Out!hi! just wondering if there are any upperclassmen who are moving out this term who have tvs that they’d like to get taken off their hands. kindly PM me to negotiate prices!

thank youRescinded Application for C’s?Hi,

I was recently admitted under the waitlist for Dartmouth. However, this semester I may get a C in a difficult chemistry class at my high school. Would getting an A, B, and a C this semester cause me to be rescinded if I had near perfect grades before 2nd semester senior year? I’m pretty anxious right now.Thanks for the feedbackWork hard not to get the C, but one really shouldn’t sink you, IMO. If they notice at all, they’ll likely ask you to explain it, and if you can do that, you should be okay.

Disclaimer: Not on the AdCom.Yesterday and through emailCongrats! Its seems this year they may have space for waitlists.

How did they tell you?Thanks for the feedback!No worries. Unless it is academic dishonesty or D/F, you are good. Enjoy Hanover!!Thanks!I got a C and a bunch of B’s in my last semester.

I'm particularly interested in learning a string instrument like violin or cello, through IIP or maybe any alternative arrangement? Do yk of ppl who did?

Also some background Abt me, my parents did force me to guitar school as a kid but I hated it and have forgotten most of it.For Piano there’s a placement process due to high demand, for all other instrument it should be open to all. But if the studio is too full beginners are lowest on the list of priority. I suggest emailing the prof you want to take lessons with and ask if you can take beginner’s lessons. https://music.dartmouth.edu/peopleFor guitar it’s open to beginnersBoating License?If you have a boating license and are looking for a fun adventure out onto the waters of the Connecticut River next week (all expenses paid) or know of someone who would be willing and is legally authorized to drive a motor boat, please PM me!can u get rescinded for ap scores?i did not lie about any exam scores. 

i am referencing scores from exams that i will be taking in the next two weeks.I'm not a member of the admissions committee, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I highly doubt it.i kind of thought you had to…i can get placement for some of my precious APs, and i think that means i’d have to send my entire report. 

i have no idea how i’ll do on my upcoming exams, but let’s just say i don’t have much optimism.Yeah to get credit you have to send them in, but darty doesn’t let you place out for a fair bit of them 

But no way that you get rescinded if you do poorly, and I seriously doubt you’ll do poorly anyways. For my year, I think the bar for getting a 5 on AP calc was like a 70%Are you sending them in?If they’re bad just don’t send them in. But even if they were bad I doubt they’d give a shit tbh. I knew plenty of ppl with 1’s and 2’s on random APsYeah to get credit you have to send them in, but darty doesn’t let you place out for a fair bit of them

I’m an incoming 26 and I was wondering if someone could tell me a little about the dorms and somewhat rank them. 

Thanks!!Coming from someone who lived in the river, I will have to disagree with this. The river is far, but that makes you make the most out of your day instead of being holed in here. It also is near the river itself, so we have taken advantage of that. We are all also really close in here. The only thing that sucks is the second floor mens bathroom and the laundry situation. But you’ll find that in any dorm.agree with the above. as far as i know, there are no one room doubles in the river, so you’ll have more personal space than a lot of your classmates in other dorms. the walk isn’t as bad as google maps makes it out to be, either (even to the LSC- i could get there in 13 minutes if i was really booking it). also, a lot of people in my floor got pretty close this year which is more common in the river because it’s somewhat more isolated.choates/river are the worstMcLaughlin is pretty sweet, and the distance problem (if any) is negated if you have a bike or scooter or \[insert similar device\]. Living in Gile or Streeter as a first-year will probably get you a single, and it has perks of being central. But I would not trade McLaughlin for anywhere else.All of the dorms will be what you make of them. Even a “bad” dorm will be great if you focus on making friends and being social. The folks who live in the River of Choates bond a lot. I would take that over having a single in a less social building - especially your first yeareach dorm is what you make of it.

the choates/river dorms are notably the "worst" dorms on campus given their far locations (river is the furthest away as it's situated behind thayer) and poor quality of housing...nonetheless, it's said that the people here form close bonds with one another, so it's not a complete loss). 

the fayes are notorious for their rowdy nightlife scene. the lack of elevators (4 floors!) and multiple-stall style bathrooms in the basement and lack of renovated interior are additional downsides to living here. if you are housed here, noise-silencing headphones and a diffuser are valuable investments. 

mclaughlin has some of the nicest dorms on campus and are commonly referred to as the "hotel" dorms...their two room doubles can be quite awkward as only one of the rooms has the closets for both. however, the renovated interiors and big snack bar are a huge plus. people usually only live in mclaughlin if they are in LLCs, though, i believe.

east wheelock also has nice dorms. aside from mcculloch which has an awkward bathroom situation and also inconvenient two room doubles, the other dorms here have private bathrooms or single-use ones which are quite nice. it is also quite common to have freshmen dorm here in singles. morton has some of the nicest amenities (recently renovated study spaces and common rooms, single-use bathrooms, tons of singles, elevator, and water bottle refill stations).agree with the above. as far as i know, there are no one room doubles in the river, so you’ll have more personal space than a lot of your classmates in other dorms. the walk isn’t as bad as google maps makes it out to be, either (even to the LSC- i could get there in 13 minutes if i was really booking it). also, a lot of people in my floor got pretty close this year which is more common in the river because it’s somewhat more isolated.Coming from someone who lived in the river, I will have to disagree with this.

I am a 21 year old living in NH who has been playing guitar for more than 8 years at this point and am also capable of backing vocals, which I intend on doing both for this band that I am putting together. I started playing guitar being inspired by punk music, but have since expanded my taste over the years to include all kinds of rock music. I have played in bands and have experience with live shows. I go to a different school but I figured that I would reach out here figuring that there may be a lot of you from NH as well!

This will be a very intense band. I'm looking for bandmates that can make themselves available at least twice a week on weekdays. We will practice for 2 hours every practice, give or take 30 minutes depending on the speed at which we are able to accomplish our goals for that night. Every member will walk into the first practice knowing the entire repertoire I have planned by heart so that all we need to work on is developing chemistry and sense of dynamics within and between songs for that practice and all those afterwards. In terms of performing live, I seek to do this at least once a month. We will work on original material, however, I have already written the majority of the material. We will start with all covers and slowly incorporate original works as we play more live shows.

Here is what I am looking for from each individual member:

1. Drums - Loud, fast, and tight percussionist with a great sense of dynamics from each individual song down to even the most minute details of small fills. I am a huge stickler for drummers...as such I will be highly critical in terms of who I want to fulfill this role.
2. Bass/Backing Vocals - Someone who knows exactly how to fill the space, and is just as tight as the drummer is what I am looking for here. Must also be able to sing some form of backing vocals, preferably harmonies.
3. Rhythm Guitarist/Co-Lead Vocals (M or F) - You must know how to execute rhythms in a way that elevates the sense of "bigness" this band has as well as sing. You will not need to perform backing vocals, only taking lead vocals on certain songs that you are assigned for this set.
4. Keys/Co-Lead Vocals (M or F) - A decent keyboard player should be able to fill the space by incorporating a large variety of sounds into the mix (piano, strings, synth, etc.) from a single instrument, and be able to switch from simply making a cover more faithful to the original to making a pretty song sound prettier. Similar to the rhythm guitarist, you will not need to perform backing vocals, only taking lead vocals on certain songs that you are assigned for this set.

Here is what I am looking for from ALL members besides the previous points I mentioned earlier in the post:

1. 18 to 25 years old. Will not accept outside of that range.
2. Playing your instruments in your role of choice in this band for a MINIMUM of 4 years.
3. Must be able to bring all of their own gear. Drummers are a special case and will be figured out at some point in the future. Rhythm guitarists must possess both an electric and acoustic guitar. Singers must own at least a microphone, it is completely understandable if you don't own some sort of sound system for it (let alone want to attempt to bring it to every practice), so we will figure this out sometime later on as well.
4. Vehemence for the genre of rock and a desire to ultimately form a bond with your bandmates that will hopefully carry on even after the band dissipates.
5. Knowledge of showmanship and how to get the crowd nodding their heads to the rhythm, even if it's less than 50 people. It ain't just about bringing the noise, people say they're going to SEE a band play live, not listen to them.
6. The desire to be great, and learning what you can in order to get there.

Speaking of being a great musician, there's one more note that I want to make clear. When we practice for the first time, I want to be the worst player in the room, but I'm going to try my absolute hardest to be best. Get it? Good.

Now onto audition materials. There are five songs for this audition. They are as follows:

1. How Far We've Come - Matchbox Twenty
2. Welcome to the Jungle - Guns N' Roses
3. Dreams - Fleetwood Mac
4. Sugar, We're Goin' Down - Fall Out Boy
5. Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting) - Elton John

This is not the full set, and at this time I am unsure if all of these songs will make the final cut for the first full repertoire, however, I am sure that 3 or 4 of them will. If there are any changes, I will let you know later via DM (I will explain that shortly). All musicians must audition all of their parts for each song. Rhythm guitar does not need to take any solos, and only needs to be able to sing How Far We've Come, Dreams, and Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting). Keys only need to play on the three songs previously mentioned, and sing on the other two. Bass players do not need to audition backing vocals, simply indicate that you are capable of doing it.

If you have made it this far and decided that you want to be a part of this project, awesome! Here are your next steps:

1. DM me indicating your interest, your role of choice, your general availability over the next 3 months, and how you meet all of the criteria listed above as well as any additional information you feel like sharing about yourself. I will then provide you a time frame (and any potential changes to the audition set, if any occur) in which you are allowed to submit your audition material to me. DO NOT SEND ME YOUR AUDITION MATERIAL ALONG WITH YOUR INITIAL MESSAGE INDICATING YOUR INTEREST OR I WILL RULE YOUR SUBMISSION AS VOID.
2. After I give you a deadline to submit your audition material, you are free to submit it at any time before the deadline. You can submit it in spurts, all at the same time, etc., but it must be live footage of you playing the songs in real time to a backing track. I will judge you based upon the level of energy that you put into playing the songs as well as the accuracy to which they are played based on the original version. Obviously, you must submit the audition before the deadline is up, otherwise, you will be excluded from being a potential band member.
3. After you submit your audition, please wait for me to reach out to you. If I invite you out to coffee or lunch, it means I'm very interested in you joining the band. We will go from there.

That's all everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read through this and if any of you have questions about this post do not hesitate to ask as I will be happy to answer them. Additionally, if any bands are looking for a lead guitarist/vocalist I am willing to do it, but understand that the main reason I'm posting this is because I'm more interested in forming my own project. Also, if any of you want to talk guitar or music feel free to DM me, I'm always down for a friendly chat :)I’m working as an entrepreneur in tech, is Dartmouth the right choice?Hey guys, I’m an admitted student who’s most probably to Darty. So basically I’m working on a tech startup in San Diego (I’m from India tho, the rest of my team’s in SD). I was wondering if Dartmouth has resources to further my goals, help me develop as an entrepreneur, secure funding, build relevant networks and the like. 

Basically, is there is a good entrepreneurial community working on tech stuff at Dartmouth, and are there ample opportunities for me to progress through this place? Tbh I’m a bit concerned cuz it’s pretty isolated.I'd reach out to the faculty and staff at this [center.](https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/)Dartmouth is also opening two new centers in Energy, and a center for Engineering and CS very soon, and those are right next to Tuck. There’s a lot happening — https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2022/01/irving-institute-center-for-engineering-and-computer-science-to-open-spring-of-2022Yo who dis?Ssup aamishYo who dis?Keggy the KegI'm a high school senior and Dartmouth is my dream school. I was wondering if Keggy was still a thing at Dartmouth? Do people still wear Keggy's costume? And also, is Keggy frowned upon by the management?KeggyManagement has put Keggy on probationWould it be okay to mention Keggy in one of my essays?Lol no100% do not mention Keggy in your essay. Why on Earth would you make any reference to campus drinking culture in your essay when 1) you're most likely under 21 and 2) you probably have many, many more things about Dartmouth or the Hanover location that specifically appeal to you aside from Keggy that you can speak to. Risky topic. Don't do it.Probably not, ik the dean at the time of his conception was actually pretty ok with it but not sure how the campus feel about him nowThank you so much for your advice! I wanted to reference wearing Keggy's costume for Halloween but I've since changed my mind.Oh okay, thanks a lot!Lol, cool costume! Do not mention :)I would not say that management wholly endorses keggy, no.Thanks a ton! Can't wait to (hopefully) attend Dartmouth 😭i mentioned it in my salutatorian speech about how our dr seuss school has a keg for a mascot but don’t talk about it in ur essay the traditions at dartmouth that you can talk about are easily more than enough with that being said we all fuckin love keggy and i personally consume more keystone light than i do water good luck buddy roll kegsManagement has put Keggy on probationLol no100% do not mention Keggy in your essay.

I'm interested in studying cs, and I had a few questions.

1. What is startup culture at Dartmouth like? I've heard a lot of great things about it.
2. Where do students normally tend to go after graduating? What kinds of companies/grad schools?
3. How prominent is doing undergrad research? And how easy is it to get involved?
4. What other things are important to take into consideration when choosing Dartmouth for CS?

Thank you so much!

(if it helps, I'm currently choosing between dartmouth and williams)Do you have any idea the kinds of research Dartmouth offers for AI and other areas of computer intelligence? Ik they have a few classes but it just doesn't seem to be a big focus at the school.Thank you so much!Artificial intelligence was actually founded there by Dartmouth professors in the 1960s.

they certainly have opportunities. They have several AI projects for undergraduate researchers, they have some AI things in dartmouth’s several CS related clubs like HackDartmouth. And, Dali Lab likely incorporates some AI and ML in their work1. Pretty great. Dali lab and the cs department have loads of opportunities and funding. 
2. Usually software engineering. Not many go to grad school. Most popular companies they work at are usually something similar to big N/Fanng like microsoft, uber, doordash, snapchat, google.
3. Decently prominent and easy to get involved since the professors are tailored to undergrad education
4. Look into DALI lab! it’s basically a part time pre professor software engineering/development job that pays around $10-15 per hour.Artificial intelligence was actually founded there by Dartmouth professors in the 1960s.

And, Dali Lab likely incorporates some AI and ML in their workIs there a club ski team?If so, how big is it and is it good? Also, how is Dartmouth ski way for those who have skied it?Ski racing at Dartmouth is run through the Outing Club, if that's what you're asking. In terms of whether Dartmouth skiing is good, yes, it is, although the results can be misleading because the really fast people (e.g., Tommy Ford, before he graduated) are in Europe and so don't show up in College results. Conversely, other schools will recruit athletes off Europa Cup to come to the US, but, yes, it's very good and has been for a century. Maybe you're asking something else.
Skiway is fun. Nobody will confuse it for Rendezvous Peak, but you can have a great time there.Yes, there is both a club level nordic and alpine team that compete in the USCSA against schools from all over New England. I don't know much about the nordic team but I know the Alpine team practices twice a week and has about 5-6 races a season. No experience needed for either but both have members who have competed at high levels before college so there is a wide skill range.Any reason to take AP Literature or AP Biology exams?I’m going to Dartmouth next year and I’m signed up to take these two exams this year. Since they aren’t in Dartmouth’s chart for AP credit, is there any reason for me to take them?I don’t think so? Unless your school makes you take the exam then I don’t think there’s any benefit you would get. Not sureWhy does that even matter? If you are already admitted to Dartmouth your hs gpa has become irrelevantVal and sal lolI’m in the same boat, I’m taking 5 ap exams and Dartmouth doesn’t take any of the credit but I still have to take them otherwise our school doesn’t weight our GPA as AP 🥲Has anyone asked thier admissions counselors at Dartmouth if they have to take AP tests?  If the tests were listed on the common app as going to take this spring do you have to follow through and take them or can you skip them if you know you won't get a 5 or don't want to skip the class next year?  Anyone know?I will be messaging you in 1 day on [**2022-04-29 14:05:33 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-04-29%2014:05:33%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/udu3gt/any_reason_to_take_ap_literature_or_ap_biology/i6j9pln/?context=3)

Also good riddance HanlonThey were always sent out at like 1 or 2am so if you were up late studying with people, someone would say "it's Vox O'Clock."Yea it is I’ve definitely heard people say it.

It comes out at 1 AM right nowLest the old traditions failHow big is the DPlan actually for finding internships? Is that the only major benefit of it?Trying to decide between Dartmouth and a few other top schools for a major in CS with a focus in AI. Dartmouth from what I've heard has the weakest program for this area out of my options (albeit not by much, they're all very close), but I haven't ruled it out yet since I keep hearing things about the DPlan making internships miles easier to come by. Basically, I'm just wondering how big of an advantage is actually gives you with stuff, like whether it's a slight boost or if it's actually a major game-changer where you'd get internships you almost never could have gotten otherwise.People get way too caught up in the USNews CS rankings. It's a ranking of grad programs not undergrad programsAnd those rankings rely heavily on department size b/c of research output, which can work against smaller departments like Dartmouth. Many students actually prefer a smaller department environment - you definitely get to know your professors better here. It does come with downsides, though, e.g. we haven't had a deep learning class here in a year because the main deep learning professor got hired by Facebook (that'll be fixed soon though).

The term "Artificial Intelligence" was literally coined at Dartmouth, and the BASIC language was invented here too. It's a top tier department. If you're applying to serious CS jobs (or grad schools) from here they'll count Dartmouth the same as anywhere else in the upper tier, they care far more about your technical abilities.

Additionally I'll add that I'm a grad student with not many undergrad connections and yet I know three undergrads who are going to FAANG after graduation this year.I'm just concerned that employers and other ppl won't understand thatThey won’t care. They’ll just see an Ivy League schoolI can say that employers won't care about that as a grad myself. Dartmouth has many recruiting options with big tech companies and smaller startups. You also have the unique opportunity where professors are heavily involved with student life, meaning they will help you put more where larger schools don't have that luxury. 

The D Plan is why I attended because it gave me a lot of flexibility with internships. And internships are what lead to jobs. Your major won't carry as much weight as your internship experience when applying to jobs. 

And like someone else stated, networking is so important at work and finding jobs.So do you think the DPlan and the internships that come from it were a major factor in your success after graduation?Absolutely. I had an advantage over other candidates because I did so many internships. And because there were fewer interns during "offseasons," I could work on more significant projects. We could do full-time internships when other schools couldn't. I'm in tech, but I was a humanities major. Nobody has ever asked about my majors. They only cared about work experience and how it ties to the position. And as a manager, I care about the same thing. 

The only disadvantage is how remote Dartmouth is. And you can't do an internship with a large company while attending schools like universities located in major cities. Students at NYU or Columbia have a big advantage there. That might change since more people are going remote.I see so many posts about how Dartmouth's CS program "isn't quite as good" as some others, and I think that they really miss a big point about hiring.

Making up some numbers, no hiring manager is going to look a a student from the #10 program differently from the #12 program. The #10 program vs. the #200 program? Yeah, that'll probably matter. But there is way more individual variation between candidates than there is between CS programs in a given "tier". A good student from a #12 program is going to be a much stronger candidate than a mediocre student from a #10 program. So don't sweat the fine points so much. 

Also, *soft skills*. For every asocial, supernatural programmer that gets hired because they're _just that good_ there are 10 (or 50) people who get jobs because they're competent programmers who are also, like, functional adults. 

So stop worrying so much about the precise rankings and go somewhere that you think will help you become a (high) functioning adult. To that end, I think a liberal arts degree with a CS major from a school as good as Dartmouth is a pretty compelling opportunity.A lot of other undergrads can only pursue internships and/or jobs over the summers. That's a really competitive applicant pool. You can have a unique opportunity to apply to/reach out to a company that you admire and be the only undergrad to do so. I know a lot of people who got to do very cool things on their off terms.Are there less internship opportunities during off months though?No. Some specific programs (like freshman ones for the underrepresented) are summer (you can’t even use the d plan as a freshman anyways), but usually all internships are available year aroundPretty big difference. 99+% of students who do internships compete for the limited summer ones. You’d basically be competing against less than 1% of the talent if you apply to winter, spring, or fall ones. It’ll be like applying to a something that no one else can apply to.And those rankings rely heavily on department size b/c of research output, which can work against smaller departments like Dartmouth.

It seems as though Hanover and the surrounding areas are in a bit of a housing crunch (as is the rest of the country). Due to this, I expect to live in a nearby town (most likely Lebanon, Wilder, or Hartford). I've found a handful of potential places using Dartlist, Zillow, Craigslist, etc., but are there other resources should I use? Would it be worth it to use a realty firm? Furthermore, if you have experience with living well-off-campus, I'd love to hear what you have to say (I am coming from a *very* walkable campus city). 

Which leads me to my next question: how is parking on-campus? I noticed [this](https://www.dartmouth.edu/transportation/parking/cost_information/gradstudentcommunication8262021.pdf) announcement which states that grad students won't be charged a parking fee for fall-term parking. That is great, but is on-campus parking competitive? How likely is it that I get a parking spot? I am fully open to using public transportation, but there are likely to be many days where I get to campus early and leave late. 

P.S. I'm from Northern Minnesota, so I'm fine with winter driving :) thanks in advance!The Dartmouth Real Estate site has a community list: https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/rental-property/upper-valley-rentals and a faculty/staff/grad student list: https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/rental-property/dartmouth-rental-housing/graduate-rentals

I’m not sure if sharing a specific landlord name here is acceptable or not but if you’re looking in Orford, I’m happy to warn you away from a landlord there via private message. She’s left a string of wronged tenants, including at least one that won a case against her in small claims court. We found out too late. She lists on the community list so I like to mention this whenever I share the list.Parking here isn't a problem - almost all the graduate students I know commute, yet the lot I use gets at most halfway full during the week. Also parking passes have been free for graduate students the entire time I've been here - not sure if that'll continue, but I'd assume yes. Hanover public street parking is free after 5pm and rarely full. The area is small enough that there's hardly any traffic, even at 9am or 5pm.Parking is free for Guarini students in Dewey lot. Thayer students get Ledyard, Lewiston and Dewey for free. If you work in the new CECS building, then you get all 3 for free as well. This is until at least the coming June. Hopefully it continues being free.

Dewey is not competitive at all — lots of free space. But ledyard is competitive at times. Lewiston is also mostly free. Thayer staffs (such as research assistants) use it since they don’t get ledyard parking.Random point, but the spaces in Dewey are about a foot more narrow than NH guidelines, so be aware you are going to pick up A LOT of door dings.  Smaller spaces is how Dartmouth fits more cars in a lot.Why did you choose Computer Science at Dartmouth?Can I know why you guys chose computer science at Dartmouth specifically and not any other college? Also, if I wanted to take a few game design courses next to software engineering core courses just to pursue it as a hobby, is Dartmouth the right place?

Thanks in advance.If you want to pursue a hobby, there are a lot cheaper ways to get started besides an Ivy League school w/ $60,000+/year tuition! Not so sure about game design, but there are 3D design & animation classes.

Dartmouth was by far the most “prestigious” school I got into, so for me it was a no-brainer. Certainly, there are many other schools that are less “prestigious” but offer a competitive, if not better, computer science education; however, it was more important to me to have a well-rounded education with name-brand value, strong alumni support, and future connections.

After spending a couple years in post-grad, I’m very happy with my pre-grad decision process. I work in Silicon Valley, and people here come from all types of schools. Those at tech-centric schools like CalPoly, Georgia Tech, MIT, etc. had to take lots of classes for their B.S. that I didn’t have to take to get my B.A. Many of these classes were difficult and didn’t end up paying off in the end by giving relevant experience for the job market. Getting the B.A. at Dartmouth, I was able to take more classes that I was passionate about on the side in addition to the core CS curriculum, which is certainly sufficient to land a job in the current market.It's insanely easy to get to Google/Microsoft by getting your degree at DartmouthI didn't come here thinking I'd do CS, but the alumni network for tech, consulting and banking is fucking insane.I'm a grad student going to Dartmouth next year for CS. I went to an undergrad school that didn't offer any CS, and I'm really interested in game design/programming, so getting a grad degree in CS is something that is worth my while regardless. I applied to a ton of schools, and while some of the big California schools (Berkeley, Stanford, USC) might be better for game industry connections due to their location (and not to mention some of the best cs programs in the country), Dartmouth is much closer to my family, and is a 2 year program while some others are only 1 (I'll need the extra time since I have a small cs background).

Dartmouth also has the digital arts program, and its website includes some references to game design, and lists some places that students have done internships at. I'd check it out here: [http://digitalarts.cs.dartmouth.edu/](http://digitalarts.cs.dartmouth.edu/)

I'm not sure what specific game design courses there are, but I'd bet there are a fair number of students interested in games.This was the only place that accepted me. A lot of grad students come here because its the only place they got into 😅It's insanely easy to get to Google/Microsoft by getting your degree at DartmouthQuestions about the new summit on JuniperHi everyone, 

I am an incoming Dartmouth Master program student. I am looking into housing options at this moment.

The summit on juniper is an option and I believe undergrad students have already moved into the apartment this spring. 

It’s a brand new apartment with nice alarm ties. However, there are some concerns I have:

1. How much is the electric bill? I know that there is a 35 dollars credit per person. But this apartment building uses individual water heater to generate heated water. I have seen similar ones in nyc and monthly electric bill can be up to 400 bucks for a regular two bedrooms.( bill from a traditional central boiler apartment is around 100 bucks for the same tenants)


2. How is the noise insulation? I heard the wall is super thin and ppl can hear conversation from the other apartment.

3. How bad is the smell? The new construction makes me dizzy and I am not sure how other ppl feel when moving in.

4. Open-ended question: what other problem did you encounter?

Thanks for the help!Yep. You take why you can find and deal with it.Not to be crass, but if these things are even on your radar or of concern you are better off not moving to the upper valley. Housing here is at an all time high in demand and the college is not going to help you at all. They do not care about graduate students. If you have the cash to swing it and really want to come here then by all means. Otherwise, I'd sincerely consider how badly you want to come to Dartmouth.Yep. You take why you can find and deal with it.What are the different LLCs like?McLaughlin seems very nice and I might apply to a few LLCs to get a room there. I was wondering what the different LLCs are like e.g. how were your experiences there, what type of activities they do, what type of ppl do they usually attract, pros and cons and over all vibe. 
I feel like I'm gonna apply to Thriving Through Transitions and the Great Issues Scholars. I feel like I'm the type of person they want at GIS and would be a good fit there but I also like the mission of T3 and it might be helpful on adjusting to a new environment, especially as an international. Might try the Humanities LLC too.
Also, is the niceness of McLaughlin worth being on the edge of campus?cs is in a different building nowyea, but anon hall is still the closest to mclaughlin compared to most dorms, pretty much the same path as lscI've lived in Mclaughlin for two years, feel free to dm me with any questions since that's a pretty wide range you want to cover.

You'll be close to the LSC, Steele, Sudikoff, and the library so if you're interested in life sciences, physical sciences, or cs then it won't be that far off. It'll be like a 5-6 minute trek to dining halls but it really wasn't that bad.

Facilities were great and even if you get assigned a double, the rooms are spacious enough and separated by a door that it's pretty much a single. 

In terms of type of people and vibe, it honestly depends on who you are grouped with. Some of the clusters like humanities were very tight knit and did alot of events but I heard that others were very hands off and struggled to even retain interest (those have since not been renewed bc of covid it looks like). 

There's alot activity wise like apple picking, 6 flags, nyc/boston trips but again that depends on if you enjoy interfacing with your cluster and if that cluster is involved at all. 

I have alot more I can say about this so just feel free to DM any McLaughlin/LLC questions.yea, but anon hall is still the closest to mclaughlin compared to most dorms, pretty much the same path as lsccs is in a different building nowyea, but anon hall is still the closest to mclaughlin compared to most dorms, pretty much the same path as lscResearch at Geisel School of MedicineHi, I am a prospective student and I was wondering if undergrads can do research/gain access to facilities at Geisel School of Medicine? I am interested in biomedical research in gene technology/oncology. Also any information on the Pre-Med track at Dartmouth would be much appreciated. Thank you!!Hey there, current grad student at Geisel. You can absolutely do research in one of the labs on campus either in the medical school or within the bio program or at the hospital. The options for undergrad research is a strength of the school. As for the medical track, I cannot comment on that as I do not have any experience in that area.Yes you can! I did research at Geisel when I was an undergrad. Pretty much just emailed the PIs and got a spot. 
There’s not really a strict premed track but the advisors are good at letting you know what classes you need to take to meet requirements. Biology was probably the most popular major among premeds.You definitely can - just be aware of your time constraints in this new environment.  As someone who worked with about a dozen Dartmouth undergrads in a research lab over the years, the biggest problem was that a freshman would come in thinking they could do it all at Dartmouth - classes, social, research, extracurriculars.  Then fast-forward past the two months of necessary bench chaperoning, and I'd often find they flamed out as they realized they were WAY over-extended, and then either quit or asked to come in just once a week (which is the same as quitting, TBH).  It happened enough times that I eventually decided only take sophomores or older as it's in your second year that you really begin to figure out what you are capable of doing.So many medical research opportunities on campus, all you have to do is ask!How do quarter schedules work?I'm a high-schooler that wants to apply to Dartmouth, and I was checking the website. It said that there are 4 ten-week quarters per year, but the website said students only take classes for 12 quarters. That leaves one quarter each year without any classes. Is this right?Cool! Thanks!The 4 quarters a year include summer, so almost everyone takes freshman and junior summer off. Because of sophomore summer, you also wind up taking one "normal" academic year term off during sophomore or junior year.

The terms run roughly:

* Fall - Early September - Thanksgiving
* Winter - New Years - Mid-March
* Spring - Late March - Early June
* Summer - Late June - Late AugustThe sophomore summer is required as far as i knowMy information is out of date, but last I heard there are some exceptionsVisa issues for full year abroad for internationals, significant research or job opportunity, financial hardship, health issues https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/enrollment/petitions/Yes, this is right. Many students stay for the summer sophomore year and take another quarter off.Cool! Thanks!My information is out of date, but last I heard there are some exceptionsVisa issues for full year abroad for internationals, significant research or job opportunity, financial hardship, health issues https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/enrollment/petitions/The sophomore summer is required as far as i knowVisa issues for full year abroad for internationals, significant research or job opportunity, financial hardship, health issues https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/enrollment/petitions/My information is out of date, but last I heard there are some exceptionsVisa issues for full year abroad for internationals, significant research or job opportunity, financial hardship, health issues https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/enrollment/petitions/handling school expenses togetherhey, since the semester is almost over: if you have some dorm supplies or textbooks you don't need anymore, or want to sublet for the summer you can list all stuff on College Souk

I've been working on this app for a while [collegesouk.com](https://collegesouk.com/) / [instagram.com/collegesouk](https://instagram.com/collegesouk) (follow is appreciated)

It's a free marketplace restricted to students — once you log in with your user@dartmouth.edu email you'll see listings from peers on the Dartmouth campus only.

I'm currently on adding services section so it's gonna be a place for finding tutors as well

I hope you find it helpful..As a broke student myself I wanted to develop something that can help reduce expenses during these 4 years 💚 (upvote for visibility! more ppl means more cheap items for students)South Asian Community at DartmouthHey everyone! I’m an accepted student and was wondering what the south asian/indian-american community is like at Dartmouth. I’ve grown up in a pretty white town and have always wanted a sort of “brown community” around me to just talk about our common culture and experiences. Would I get this at Dartmouth?Thanks for the response! How large was the association when you were a part of it?There were about 300 members in the GroupMe, including also people simply interested in South Asian life and culture. I’d say about 50 were regularly active and 20+ went to every single major event. Hard to say, exactly, as it waxed and waned with who was on campus each term.You certainly would -- the South Asian Students' Association at Dartmouth was very active with event-planning and outreach, last I was a part of it. There're a good mix of people, undergraduates, graduate students, from Wisconsin to Massachusetts to India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, etc. themselves. Some had parents who grew up in Europe or Africa. A wide variety of experiences and viewpoints and interests but with some common characteristics, of course. Diwali on campus is a big affair, and there are Hindu, Muslim, etc. services in Rollins Chapel and other places frequently. There's also a surprisingly large South Asian community in the Upper Valley (some professors and some simply living and working in the area) who come to the Hopkins Center for the occasional dance performance. There's one excellent Indian restaurant and one even more excellent Nepalese restaurant in Hanover itself (<15 mins from the Green) and more in the surrounding towns.Not really, at least not when compared to larger Ivies or state schools. There’s not a big culture around dance teams, acapella groups, and cultural events that you might find at Michigan or Penn for example.

You’ll definitely meet other south Asian students (and some of them will become your best friends) but I wouldn’t bank on a huge brown community like you might find elsewhere. Not a bad thing - I actually loved the extra push to get out of my comfort zone as someone who came from a pretty brown high school haha

Feel free to DM me if you got any other QsCurrent first year student here! Tbh, had no idea about the South Asian Students' Association here...could be in part due to lack of advertising around campus. 

The different South Asian student bodies in my perspective operates like a mosaic and is quite separated, 

As for Muslim students, there is one small prayer room with a very small (10 students ish) community. I believe that Hindu Puja services happen daily at 7pm in Rollins Chapel.

The desi food here is not ideal (definitely miss home cooked meals around here). Not a fan of the options on campus but different cultural+religious clubs sometimes have events where they would cook foods which is a great experience. 

There are South Asian dance groups where I think you are most likely to find other desi students. Apart from that, it is quite hard to find more brown kids.If you don’t mind, could you elaborate a little?I'm neither the original commenter, nor South Asian, but is there something more specific you're looking for? South Asian Student Association, dancing, sports?Yes.There were about 300 members in the GroupMe, including also people simply interested in South Asian life and culture. I’d say about 50 were regularly active and 20+ went to every single major event. Hard to say, exactly, as it waxed and waned with who was on campus each term.Thanks for the response!

A lot of majors have math 3 and/or math 8 prerequisites (the equivalent of AP calc AB and BC respectively). There is a QDS requirement for all students, however (fulfilled by stats or math).PHIL 6 and LING 1 both give a QDS too!Do the theatre students generally participate in fraternities/sororities or do the theatre students have their own little community outside of Greek life?Ok thank you for this information!  That’s great to know.A good number of the theatre students are part of Greek life, but I imagine they are also a pretty tight knit group on their own from what I’ve seen from people on campus since they do productions and such together.Ok thank you for this information!  That’s great to know.Bound IncomeHas anyone gotten into Bound without being either FRPL eligible or test fee waiver eligible? Not super low income but not well off either so unsure how this will effect my chances.Is the ethics minor still a thing?I can see it in ORC and the minors list and the requirements but the ethics institute links there end up nowhere and the Institute website shows nth regarding the minor. Also an alumni told me it might have been disbanded.No, if you google it, that entry is from the '17-'18 ORC. It was discontinued that year unfortunately. You can pretty easily focus the Philosophy modified major or minor on ethics though!TimetableHi! I’m coming to Dartmouth next year as part of the Thayer dual degree. I’m having trouble accessing the summer timetable through the link I was sent. I’m getting a 500 error. Does anyone have a link to the timetable that’s working? I was told the link should be live by the 22nd.Thank you!!https://oracle-www.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/timetable.mainThank you!!Can someone tell me more about the gym facilities at Dartmouth?I am a ´2026 and I truly love working out. I just wanted to know more about the gym facilities and some general advice/recommendations.Do you have a personal trainer? Do you have to pay a fee?You can do a virtual tour of the fitness center here: https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/2018/5/30/590342.aspxOMG SAME, PM MEEAlso a ‘26 and I love working out… super excited abt morning hikes before workoutsHi! ‘25 here, no need to pay a fee. All students have free gym access. You just have to scan in with your student ID.Do you have a personal trainer? Do you have to pay a fee?OMG SAME, PM MEEHow easy is it to have driving lessons and get a license in/near Hanover?Would like any input on if this is a done thing, especially for internationals. 

Thank you!Keep in mind that a lot of people do this and use a VT address of a friend’s, but it is likely considered fraud. Highly unlikely you would get caught, but just do your legal research first unless you’re willing to risk it.Classes are very limited in the area. You have to mostly remain on a waitlist for weeks if not months. Because of the limited classes, they’re also very expensive. As an International, you should also know that in NH, if you don’t have a license from your home country, you have to mandatorily take driving classes. This means you cannot learn driving from someone you know. Because of this reason, a lot of students just show residency in Vermont (use a friend’s address as their address) and get their license from Vermont. In Vermont, you don’t have to take classes and learn from anybody and appear for the test directly. You can transfer your license to NH once you get it.

I’d recommend getting the license from your country, if possible. If you have a foreign license, you can use it for 60 days (i think) and appear for the test directly without taking any classes.Those were almost certainly from an area high school. The College does not have driver's ed to the best of my knowledge.Hanover High School hires a driving school to hold classes for students, I do remember having a Dartmouth student (international) in my drivers Ed class so it is doable for Dartmouth students. There are also a couple private driving schools - Warners is one of them, but I don’t know anything about it.this is totally an anecdote but i went to hanover for a day and a half basically and saw three drivers ed cars. no guarantee they were college affiliated but it seems to me like classes are there.Keep in mind that a lot of people do this and use a VT address of a friend’s, but it is likely considered fraud.

On Dartmouth’s website it mentions that they give out institutional loans. I wanted to know if anyone had any experience getting these loans because I asked for one (I can take out private loans to meet my efc) and I haven’t got a response back. Just wanted to know if this was still a thing or if this is outdated information.Thanks you so much. Hoping that it’s different for domestic studentsI'm not sure if it's different for domestic students but this is what the finaid office told me.
"International students can borrow a Dartmouth Student Loan. It is a subsidized loan (interest does not begin accruing until nine months after graduation), and the interest rate is 7%. In the financial aid offer, the Dartmouth Student Loan can replace student employment, the student contribution, the cost of a computer, and half of the student health insurance cost. We cannot replace the parent contribution with Dartmouth loan."Thanks you so much. Hoping that it’s different for domestic studentsGREEK LIFE AT DARTMOUTHhi, I’m a prospective Dartmouth student and am wondering what the campus culture is like if you are NOT involved in greek life.

I really like a lot of things about dartmouth, but the intensity and involvement in greek life definitely deters me, and I’m wondering what kind of student activity exists outside of the part scene. bc I’m a lamo and do not enjoy parties.

any and all insight is welcome and helpful!one thing about dartmouth that i underestimated was how central greek life is to a majority of students here. this is largely because of the lack of other nightlife/amenities existing beyond dartmouth itself in hanover/nearby area. for background, i'm a freshman, but i'm just not into drinking/partying. 

my advice is to seek out other individuals and friends who share similar values and interests. you can do this in more chill settings from going out to lunches, going on walks, or attending collis/club events which can be pretty fun! don't ever feel compelled to do something you don't want to do if your heart isn't into it and if it's something you're not comfortable with in the first place. the community you strive for is here...just takes time to figure out and find the right group of people.

plus, there's always more to life than just frat parties. sometimes just asking people if they'd be down for something like a pizza party or a night-in can do wonders in developing intimate friendships and finding a group of friends that relate to you...having a supportive group of like-minded friends will be especially helpful to you since there's not much on campus aside from the school itself.This is definitely reassuring. One of the things I’m looking forward to most abt college is being involved in things, and I’m at a pretty big high school that has a bunch of idiots rn and am managing with my group of people I’m friendly with. 

ig a question I still have is do parties divide the campus? like does the party culture destroy campus unity?i don't know how to answer that. parties bring us together if anything, but they're frat parties. lots of people will host smaller parties, house parties or parties through sports or clubs. and everyone is always invited to almost anything, besides specific frat events.i think this is an effective answer. the idea is that you’ll find unity in a number of circles, right? so it doesn’t matter if the entire student body is on the same page.i hate greek life. i think it's the worst thing about dartmouth, lol. i felt less strongly when i came in, but knew i wouldn't rush.

the best thing you can do is build a group of friends who also aren't big into greek life. DOC people often fit the bill. people also build really great communities around club and IM sports. i am not a sports person, but i really pushed myself out of my comfort zone. i asked people out to lunches when i wanted to know them better, i threw "dinner parties" (read: domino's pizza and beer), and i offered favors to people as much as i could. i have a great group of friends now, especially because i'm VERY involved in my relatively small department. i also befriended grad students. 

so it's possible, absolutely, to make friends and have a great time at dartmouth without going through greek life. but it does require more work. you need to be ok, especially in the beginning, with getting out of your comfort zone, building a pattern through which to make friends. i saw it kind of like dating. 1) ask out to lunch 2) invite to watch something or study together 3) if you like them, ask what they're up to on friday nights. you can honestly get a good thing going just by studying with the same people over and over. there are concerts here, there are sunny days where you can sit on the green and just talk. but you will have to put effort in.

"just ask people to hang out!" is such trite advice, but that's what my socially inept self did. if they demurred or seemed busy, i gave up and tried someone else i thought was cool. everyone's lonelier than they seem in college.This is so helpful, ty. I’m trying to be positive so would you say that you can look past whatever drawbacks partying does have to enjoy it, or is it really that impactful?As a fresh 18 year old, we all go through questionable times and actions. I personally enjoyed my time here but as a freshman it would be pretty tough because all the kids just party because they think thats what College Kids should do. It will absolutely suck for the first few terms but then when everyone mature up a bit, it will be a great College experience.

My only advice : Have some reliable friends and you will  generally be having a good time.awesome. unfortunately this means it likely won’t be at the top of my list, but it’s the ‘exception’ students that I’ve found that assure me that i’ll be fine wherever.They will lie and tell you that there are fun stuffs to do if you aren't into Greek Life; I bought that nonsense and you too will soon realize its bs. It sucked back then and after the last 2 years, The Admin had further shutdown everything that made Dartmouth barely enjoyable outside or Greek.
Best I can tell you is you might grow to enjoy it and even participate (I did, but now kinda grew crusty).i don't know how to answer that. parties bring us together if anything, but they're frat parties. lots of people will host smaller parties, house parties or parties through sports or clubs. and everyone is always invited to almost anything, besides specific frat events.i think this is an effective answer. the idea is that you’ll find unity in a number of circles, right? so it doesn’t matter if the entire student body is on the same page.This is definitely reassuring.

I’m a ‘26 and have been thinking about what courses I might want to take this fall term. My intended major is neuroscience on the pre-health track, and I know that on average students will take 3 classes per term. 

I was wondering if anyone has suggestions as to what courses I could take. I’m looking for a mix of harder and easier classes that I could take to fulfill my requirements while not completely ruining my GPA. 

2 classes I’m considering are Math 3 and Psyc 6 but I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to take both in the same term.
Layuplist.comThank you so much! Yes, a lot of the neuro pre-reqs also align with the pre-med reqs so that works out nicely.I believe Neuroscience has a LOT of prereqs (as does pre-health), so it's probably wise to start knocking some of those out. MATH 3 and PSYC 6 should be fine during the same term. You may wind up having WRIT 5 during the fall too, but you won't know that for a while.take placement exams for the types of courses you know you’re going to take (e.g. math, chemistry, biology) so you don’t waste time taking courses with content you already know.Thank you so much! Yes, a lot of the neuro pre-reqs also align with the pre-med reqs so that works out nicely.Dartmouth PowerliftingDoes anyone know how Dartmouth Powerlifting is organized and how often they meet?

If so, how long are they?You can see the whole academic calendar here: https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/calendar/academic/21-22.html

Breaks range from 6ish weeks from Thanksgiving to New Years to more like 2 weeks between the other terms.I don't know if anyone has explained the D-plan to you, but you don't take all 4 terms every year. It's a system where you pick 3/4 (on average). Freshman and senior year is your traditional Fall through spring with the summer off, but sophomore and junior year you pick (except sophomore summer has to be on).no, we actually have classes 52 weeks a yearlooking to make friendsI'm an incoming 26 and looking to chat with some of my classmates.

DM me :)unexpected dorm room recs?what’s something that you didn’t expect to need/find helpful? or something that’s totally unnecessary?A brita and extra water bottles.  Lost water bottles like socks in the dryer, and a lot of dorms don't have water fountains.Get a drying rack, the dryers don’t always work well and it costs $1.50 to run themBuying those heavy chests are a complete waste of money and super hard to lug around term to term.definitely getting a small fan, drawer organizers, Tide pen for stains, perfume beads for washing clothes, SLIPPERS (especially, if you have a common area in your dorm)I notice a lot of ppl use scooters or bikes on campus. Are they really that useful?It's up to you. If you live in a remote dorm/house and/or have back-to-back classes on opposite ends of campus then you may want one.Personally for me, yes. Only because I like getting to places faster than walking lol. Also there's relatively less crime in Hanover so bike theft is not something you have to worry about as much as perhaps other places (though you still will want a bike lock/chain).skateboarding will get you more tapsDefinitelyLots of bikes and scooters.That is a great point. I used bikeindex.org to register it, but I think I should also register it with S&S.Also, be sure to register your bike with S&S. They'll etch a number into it which can help recover it if it is lost or stolen.Don’t bikes slow you down?So do you still lock it up if it’s foldable while you’re at class or something tho?I do, but bring it in overnight.Co-sign other comments , bike lock for sure . I didn’t use my bike daily but on my long days , it helped a lot. My parents were also worried about bike theft , so they got me a foldable commuter bike - no worries about someone taking it- :)definitely depends on where you live+whether you can afford it+whether you will actually use it. if you live in the river dorms, maybe it will be of more use to you. aside from that, everywhere on campus is pretty walkable (no more than a 20 minute walk to anywhere)...just depends on what you'd prefer.That is a great point. I used bikeindex.org to register it, but I think I should also register it with S&S.I do, but bring it in overnight.So do you still lock it up if it’s foldable while you’re at class or something tho?I do, but bring it in overnight.Financial Service User Survey - DiversaTech @ UC BerkeleyHello everyone!

As part of a consulting project, my team is currently collecting data by surveying and interviewing dozens of college students across the country in order to better understand student preference, sentiment, and behavior towards innovation in financial services (e.g. app-based brokerages, digital banking, etc). In an effort to further a student initiative, I kindly ask for your collaboration by filling out this quick 3 minute [survey](https://forms.gle/uyvv2bt9V4qaBhdh9)! Also, please indicate that Marden referred you to this survey.

Thanks!

Is it essentially students working in teams on various projects (and getting paid for it)?What's the process for getting into DALI?[http://dali.dartmouth.edu/applicationsupplement](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/applicationsupplement) 

No time limit. You download all materials and submit to them as one package and they review your application. I've never done it myself but I have two interns who were accepted to Dali while in my internship program and one who did my program + Dali at the same time (we're an upper valley company) and it was tough for her but now she's an SDEII @ Amazon just 1 year out of Dartmouth and Dali and making $180K a year....so like I said, it's worth it to try and get in. They teach you a lot of soft skills that make working in tech much easier.As someone who brings on about 18 CS undergrad interns a year, the best and brightest are members of DALI. It’s a great program and gives you real world experience. If you get picked, it’s worth your time to join.Unity would definitely be my largest interest, since game development is my aim. The website + coding challenge also lists that there's a lot of interest in VR?VR/AR projects weren't particularly uncommon when I was there (2018-19). Those constituted the majority of the Unity projects. I wouldn't be surprised if that has picked up some in recent years, though, with the increase in popularity of VR as a medium (thanks, Oculus), helped on campus by an undergrad course for AR & VR design & development. I just checked on the course listing, and the design portion of the course is also offered as a grad level course (123), if that's something you're interested in.Thanks, that's good to know. I will probably send in an application.Former DALI dev here. It's worth mentioning that DALI projects are generally pretty focused on web applications, usually with one or two Unity projects as well per term. If these aren't the skillsets you want to be developing, DALI may not be right for you.[http://dali.dartmouth.edu/applicationsupplement](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/applicationsupplement)

I've scheduled a zoom call with the office later this week, and will be talking to them about aid.

Unfortunately, schools have given me very little aid, with the highest package still making it impossible to attend. Regarding merit offers, are you referring to merit scholarships?

Dartmouth is my dream school; I'll be turning down a few great schools (cambridge, chicago, CMU, berkeley) to attend - will the quality of those schools impact the aid offer in any significant way?Yes, I am referring to merit scholarships.

I have not gone through the aid process myself, but again if you can respectfully find a way to insert the other colleges into the conversation to demonstrate your desire to go to Dartmouth, I think it's worth a shot. I would still mention the highest aid package you got, especially if Dartmouth gave you nothing.

Another thing to be aware of is ways your FAFSA may not have accurately represented the "usual" income of your family. When I applied to Dartmouth, my FAFSA was messed up because the company my father works for had just been sold, and he had "assets" that weren't actually his, which Dartmouth counted as money in our pocket. Likewise, I had a friend whose father sold his business when she applied to college. He was in the process of buying a new business with that money (and these were small businesses, think local car dealerships) but her college again considered that money to be stuff they could just spend on college. When she spoke to the college she wanted to go to, I know she told them about the sale and about how all that money was going to be re-invested. I also believe she might have given them older tax returns to demonstrate how much her parents make *on average*. I think that may be helpful. My friend did end up getting a much more advantageous aid package.

Gather every tax return your parents or guardians still have on file, as well as all of your past tax returns. Also, think about if your financial situation really reflects how much money your family has. Write down things that have cost your family a lot of money, like medical bills or another child about to go to college. At the end of the day, respect and earnestness will take you a long way. Be upfront with the office. I really hope it works out for you!Why have other schools not given you much aid either? Does your family appear to be making more than they actually are making? Because if tuition is more than your family's income, Dartmouth should be giving you a lot of aid.ok thank you so, so much!! This is uber helpful, i'll definitely follow your advice!i'm actually not sure either, my FAFSA efc was still way too much (about half of post-tax income) but we "could" technically push through and pay it. i was expecting a lot more aid honestly.I'm so glad it's helpful : ) HMU if you end up visiting or going here!talk to the financial aid office. schedule a meeting with them, explain your situation (especially the part about tuition being more than post-tax income and your EFC). that is your best bet. i've known plenty of people who successfully petitioned their tuition down by talking to the financial aid office, both at dartmouth and at other similar schools.

it is not an easy process by any stretch of the imagination. i've heard it's quite stressful. but take a deep breath and get in contact with them. that is your best bet.

i don't think it's a faux pas to mention other schools, especially if they gave you more financial aid than dartmouth (emphasis on FINANCIAL aid, because dartmouth will not care about merit offers since they don't give them). tell the office about those offers in a respectful way, and explain that dartmouth is your dream school but that money is a big consideration for you.

good luck! i'll keep you in my thoughts <3ok thank you so much! is this irrespective of any assets (price of house, etc?)https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/afford/how-aid-works#:~:text=Families%20with%20Total%20Income%20below,offer%20will%20not%20include%20loans.

Here's the information you're looking for. It doesn't explain typical assets, which I assume means a house and retirement funds.

And yeah, you can mention that you got financial aid from other schools. I did this over ten years ago, so things probably have changed. I showed them the school that had the lowest family contribution. And when I showed what Northwestern offered, they couldn't match it because NU was offering loans, and that's why they couldn't drop the cost of my parent's annual contribution. Express that Dartmouth is your first choice and you want to go there, but it's too expensive for your family! 

If you have been in contact with admissions, you should message them and see if they can give you advice. They know you and picked you; they are interested in making it work! 

If you have any siblings in college, bring that up! They're supposed to try and split the family contribution if the schools cost about the same. That helped me out since my brother was at an equally expensive private uni. 

Congratulations on getting admitted to so many great schools.If you only have 1 house for living, it doesn't count to your assetsThank you so much! in my case, i got screwed over by aid depts. everywhere, so don't have any offers per se to compare. this might be in part due to the fact that im a us citizen living abroad.  im definitely expressing my interest in dartmouth cuz id srsly love to go, cost is a pain tho.  i have a younger brother who'll go to college the year after i graduate, not sure if that'd play a role.ok thank you so much!I'm so sorry to hear that! They might be counting you as an international student; not sure if that matters? 

Do chat with admissions! They might help you find some money or chat with financial aid for you. And your school councilors! Mine were crap but you might have better ones.Dartmouth give Household income Under $125,000 , free tuitionYes, I am referring to merit scholarships.

I found an awesome house for rent in the area, DM me on interested :)Which carrier has the best cell phone coverage on campus?Hi Everyone! I am an incoming ‘26, and I was wondering which carrier (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon or any other carrier) was best on campus. Thanks so much!My experience has been Verizon is the best, but none of them are great.Both kinda suck, there's a dead zone near Thayer/West Wheelock. I've been using AT&T and I guess it has sufficed so far.I have never had any trouble with T-Mobile. In the Upper Valley area you tend to lose service pretty fast after leaving the towns and citiesI used AT&T for my four years. I never had any issues, and if your phone permits Wifi calling, switch it on and you’ll never have to worry about dead spots.If you care about cost (i.e. you are paying for your service and not your parents), MVNOs like Ting and Mint are much much cheaper and work great, as they're using the exact same networks you mentioned above.Some e-sports action?I've been getting pretty good at Rocket League recently. Anyone wants to play together either online or somewhere on campus? Open to trying other games out as well tbh.

\- JSTNShould we get one going again?would love to see it started up again, we also had an overwatch and league team but again covid kind of killed all that

it’s already extra hard at dartmouth to do gaming teams bc super low student pop + leave terms + terms getting extremely busy after like week 5I know we used to have a rocket league csl team before covid, but those guys have all graduated by now :(

Smash Bros. just held a tournament yesterday with cash prizes, and they travel to outside tournaments and do csl as well.would love to see it started up again, we also had an overwatch and league team but again covid kind of killed all that

I am an admitted int'l and haven't gotten mine yet, though I've seen others in my region receive them a week after acceptance.Fellow intl '26 here. I think we are supposed to but I'm in the same boat as you so I wouldnt think much of it. Some people in my region got it, some others didnt. I'm ED btw so not sure about RD.I'm anxious! I don't have a single close friend at high school. I'm scared that I won't be able to make any friend at Dartmouth. what shall I do?Thank you so much. This is really helpful!Every freshman is entering a new and unfamiliar situation this fall, you are not alone. I’m also nervous about making friends but what worked for me in the past is joining clubs that I care about, volunteering because I got to bond with people, and approaching people when they are alone to start small conversations. It will be okay :)[deleted]Mine too!same!! <3I'd really love that. Can you pm me your IG?😃Amazing! Thank you! Can you pm me your IG?Can you pm your IG?Hey can you pm your IG?You can be my friendThanks a lot! This is so helpful!! I hope I'll find my nicheDon’t worry! You won’t be the only one in that situation. I was the same way coming into freshman year (I’m an ‘18). I found lifelong friends freshman year that I’m still very close with today. Lack of close high school friends does not mean you’ll have the same experience in college. Everyone will be new and looking to find friends at the start of term.This is really helpful. I'm more into STEM stuffs so I'll join the relevant clubs. Hahaha yes I'll not forget to wear my sunscreen. Thank you so much!Practical tips:

1. During move in/ first week, try leaving your door propped open, and meet people on your floor
2. What are your interests? Show up to club meetings early on and see if you like the activities and people
3. Say yes to things. Someone asks if anyone wants to swim in the river? Yes. Someone asks if you want to try rock climbing? Yes. Someone wants you to play Fifa with them? Yes.
4. Don't take yourself too seriously. Most everyone is trying to find themselves, things that seem monumentally bad in the present will generally just be a bump in the road in the future, the social circle is not as closed as it seems.
5. Wear sunscreenThis is so amazing. I always adore such friendships. Thank you for motivation!That was me as a Freshman, not uncommon, quickly made lifelong friends (will be going back for reunion and staying with a college roommate)Thank you for the advices so much! Super gratefulLife gets easier as you get older with this stuff. 

The chance that you will meet someone like you gets more likely as you get older. Was it tough to be really studious in HS? Well, basically everyone at Dartmouth will have likely worked their tails off to be there. 

Are you super interested in something very niche? The longer you stay in a discipline, the better your chance of meeting someone like you. 

It’ll happen eventually. Be patient and be open. 

Also, go on your first year trip.Well, hi thereThank you so much. This is really helpful!Amazing! Thank you! Can you pm me your IG?[deleted]Can you pm your IG?Mine too!Hey can you pm your IG?same!! <3I'd really love that. Can you pm me your IG?😃Thanks a lot! This is so helpful!!

I'm doing an English Lit. + CW major and I just wanted to ask about the overall experience of studying English Lit. there.There is a "concentration" in Creative Writing within the English major.Thank you! I'm actually talking about the writing concentration -- sorry I phrased it wrong haha.How would you describe your overall experience at Dartmouth? I've heard that there is a lot of racism happening on campus especially against poc.I am an Asian American male to preface. I’m not going to lie to you and say that you’re not going to find racism here, because you will, but not more than I found in high school or anywhere else if that makes sense. In fact, I’d consider my experience at Dartmouth fantastic in comparison to my high school experience. People are a lot more mindful and accepting. I am not sure what you heard, but rest assured that the other Ivy leagues are probably worse lolYeah I’d also like to know about racism on campusWe have a creative writing major? Lol don’t think so. But I know they’re working on a minor right now. English department rocks, taking a literature class right now and it is awesome.

I am not sure what you heard, but rest assured that the other Ivy leagues are probably worse lolYeah I’d also like to know about racism on campusHow would you describe your overall experience at Dartmouth? I've heard that there is a lot of racism happening on campus especially against poc.I am an Asian American male to preface.

“Our offer of admission is made with the expectation that you will maintain the level of scholarship and personal excellence that characterized your candidacy. Accordingly, we will carefully review your performance during the remainder of your senior year…if you enroll we ask that your final transcript shall be forwarded to the Office of AdmissionsWe can't tell you. If any of us had been rescinded we wouldn't be here.Depends on a lot of factors. If you had straight As all through high school and that was a high point in your application, admissions might have some concerns about grades dropping in multiple classes. Dartmouth cares a lot about “intellectual curiosity” and senioritis is sorta antithetical to that premise. I would avoid getting Cs if at all possible. Bs most likely wouldn’t be an issue.sameidk about you but i basically got a letter in august that said “we accepted you based off your original grades, make sure you don’t fall behind at dartmouth and ask for help”i got a bunch of Cs and a D or 2 my senior year and wasn’t rescinded.I got a C+ and a few B’s my senior year, got an email that suggested I use the academic resources on campus once I got to Dartmouth but they didn’t actually say anything about rescinding meidk about you but i basically got a letter in august that said “we accepted you based off your original grades, make sure you don’t fall behind at dartmouth and ask for help”sameidk about you but i basically got a letter in august that said “we accepted you based off your original grades, make sure you don’t fall behind at dartmouth and ask for help”
