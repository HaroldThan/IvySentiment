High-Tech Entrepreneurship?Has anyone taken EGR 491: High-Tech Entrepreneurship? What is the course structure? What did you like about the course? What did you dislike? Are there any other Entrepreneurship courses you would recommend?

I personally have some tech startup ideas but am not sure how to judge market fit (or if they are viable ideas), and I'm also not sure how to build a team and raise funding. It seems like I would need funding even before building a prototype and I'm not sure if VC's give funding for just an idea.I took it a few years ago and loved it! Chris Kuenne is a wonderful professor and it was one of the best courses I took because of his teaching style. It’s mostly discussion-style, and it’s expected that you are prepared and contribute. The material is super interesting tooI took it 20 years ago with Ed Zschau. Fun class. Mostly reading HBS studies and a little bit of accounting basics.How much is a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment or house near campus?A decent 2 bedroom apartment is  ~$1800/month, 3 bedroom house is ~$2500 but there’s also a huge variation depending on location and how new/nice (or not) the place isHousing Sublet
Summer Housing from June end to Aug end

Where to find summer housing in Princeton ?I'm a UMich student who's going up to Princeton for an internship over the summer so am looking to hopefully sublet an apartment from a current student. Any recommendations??Hey Umich Intern,

Former Umich grad here with an apartment in Princeton that will be empty for all of July and a good chunk of August. DM'dTypically (~95%), Princeton students live on campus in university housing.  Finding a student with an apartment will be very difficult.  

If your internship is affiliated with the university, you may be able to coordinate summer housing through them.https://offcampushousing.princeton.edu/Also look at https://retail.tigerapps.org
there are several sublets available there rnSenior thesisAre there any concentrations at Princeton that do not require a Senior thesis? I read that there are a few that don’t. TIA!Only BSE COS. Other engineers have theses.Thank you to all!Yep, keep in mind that AB COS still requires a thesis. BSE requires a semester of independent work when I was there, but no thesis.Technically ORFE can do a senior project but I believe it is extremely frowned down upon so basically everyone writes a thesisEngineering but tbh doing a thesis is cool!Yep, keep in mind that AB COS still requires a thesis.

I'm a prefrosh from California.What's the price range like there?Honestly, I don’t remember exactly. I feel like I got a nice sports coat for $30-50 around ten years ago. It depends on what you’re trying to buy, but it was very reasonable for the quality.I was a big fan of Greene Street consignment when I was in school. Since Princeton is an affluent suburb, you can get some very high quality clothes for a reasonable price.Why is it better? Just curious.They have a better selection I think - much cooler clothes. Not sure why, but I almost always find something I like there and I can't say the same for Greene streetThe Princeton consignment shop on spring street is excellent! In my opinion much better than Greene streetThere is a banana republic, Ralph Lauren and other higher end shops but nothing midrange or low price.  If you have a car you can go to the REI at Mercer mall.Buy a few Princeton sweatshirts and you’ll be good. :)Nothing on Nassau street is cheap. There’s a free weekend shopper bus that goes to Target and some other shopping areas.

Tbh you don’t need too many winter clothes - buy one waterproof cold weather jacket for when it’s legitimately cold and snowy and buy one light water-resistant jacket, and then otherwise you should be fine in sweaters/sweatshirts/hoodies (layer if necessary). You shouldn’t go out of your way to buy sweatshirts/hoodies/sweaters - bring a couple you already have from home, and then you’ll get several for free in your time at Princeton from your class/res college. And honestly, even that might be too much - my freshman year it snowed like once, and was only below freezing for like 3 days, which my Floridian body was able to handle.AmazonThe free jackets at any eating club…. ;)Honestly, I don’t remember exactly.

I was unable to find many film classes on the course catalog. Am I looking in the wrong places, or are there really just no film classes?There are definitely classes that analyze films! If you search the catalog for film as a keyword, a bunch will pop up — but film tends to be the channel they use to analyze another topic (i.e, Spanish language and culture through film: https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1232&courseid=009308) or Hollywood history and injustice through film: https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-detailsThere’s a few classes for film analysis. In terms of film production, those tend to be one-offs (look up Princeton Atelier)I’m taking a German film theory class next semester, and I’ve taken a Japanese cinema class. I know they offer classes on Chinese, Italian, French, noir & screwball, environmental, and South Asian film.Visa assistance for newly admitted international students?Does Princeton offer any assistance to help newly admitted international students obtain their Visa on time? Is there a good contact person at the University to ask about this?Thank you! This is for a student I know, so I will share this post. Thank you so much!Yes! The Davis IC website has important information regarding visa applications. As an international student, you will have an advisor who will guide you through the visa application process. I recommend you book a Zoom appointment with your assigned advisor as soon as possible, as they will be able to guide you through the process, and you will need documentation from the Davis IC (in my case, an I-20 form, but this might change depending on where you are from and the type of visa you will apply for). 

[Here](https://davisic.princeton.edu/new-students-scholars/new-students) is a link to the Davis IC’s guide for new students.

[Here](https://davisic.princeton.edu/about-us/advising-appointments) is the page containing information on who your advisor is, and how to book a Zoom appointment with them. There are virtual drop-ins available throughout the week, and they can also be reached via email for relatively straightforward questions. 

Please let me know if the links don’t work. If you have any further questions or concerns, do feel free to DM me! Advisors are extremely kind and patient, and they will be a great resource during your Princeton journey.Thank you! This is for a student I know, so I will share this post. Thank you so much!Achieving resume successFirst off, right off the bat, I must say I am not selling anything and I certainly don't want any contact info. I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of *free* resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online.

This is the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.

Just in time for graduation and/or summer break :)

Whether looking for an internship, your first career job, or *actually* good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt.

Because let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.

Anyways, below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches ($1500 total spent there, yikes!), and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out the formula), complete with notes on how you can do it, too.

(They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after following this ressume formula and other methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).

It details how I got recruiters' attention, networked online with people who had the role I dreamed of, and, most importantly, includes a *jaw-dropping* resume/cover letter format, as well as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that contain practical tips and tricks for how to get that coveted role:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM_)

It's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those students who may be actively or passively looking for a job and need help standing out from the pack.

As mentioned earlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is *perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles *much* quicker and added a "WOW" factor to it.

**Some additional notes on resumes:**

1. Usually keep it to one page.
2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)
3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers *love* that. Which is better? "responsible for managing team and hosting meetings" or "managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota" See what I'm sayin?
4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---> number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the "vague description" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anyways.
7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.  
This is *KEY!*  
Ex: "Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America." See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a "+ after the rounded number (ex: "157 employees ---> "150+ employees") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital "K" for thousand, "M" for million (ex: $23,800 ----> $23K+; $5 million ---> $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please, *pleeeeeease* don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

"Hey (name)- I'm a (junior, senior, grad student, etc) at (uni name) and I just wanted to say that your job at (company name) seems like the dream role I'm working towards! How do you like it?" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call or over coffee (more details on that in the link).

Use the free site [hunter.io](http://hunter.io/) to find anyone's work email to send cold emails to (email templates in the link).

\------------------------

Look, I have a history of mental health issues and the the job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.

I don't want that for *anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

I want the process to be as easy as possible for *everyone* and for *free*.

I'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost guarantee their resume and tips ain't as good this.

Anyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!

Let me know in the comments if this helped.

Go get 'em, Champ!>Because let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.

I mean, Princeton has a career center where you can get specialized appointments to consult on your resume / future internships or jobs. They also have a resume guide and other information on their website.

 Post information was interesting, though.Thank you!Whatever you do. Don’t watch the new Dumbledore.oh ok i wasnt planning on doing so anywayCons of Princeton as a PhD Student vs an UndergraduatePrinceton advertises itself as "an undergraduate school". What does this mean?

How, specifically, are graduate students not appreciate by admin or professors?Why does population matter? Princeton being small seems like it would be better. Harvard is so big that no one gets attention besides the law, business, and undergrad schoolsproportionally to population; they focus on undergrad a lot moreWhat do you mean by “focus”? I think I’m dumb and can’t get what this means exactly. What do you grad students wish they had?as other comments have pointed out, undergrad is much bigger than grad so naturally more of the resources go to undergradWhat resources…If 5 percent of Princeton is grad students and the grad students receive 5 percent of princetons resources, and 40 percent of Harvard is grad students and the grad students there get 40 percent of Harvard resources, the grad school experience at the two should be the same right? So is this not the case?graduate students are indeed regarded as subhuman /s

nah but just look at the undergrad and grad population size here compared to ex. harvardAcademically, grad students are appreciated by admin and professors.  No problem there.  There are also plenty of grad student events and you'll have opportunity to meet and make friends with other grad students.  The major issue is having social outlet beyond the grad students.  Depending on your personality, you may wish to expand your social circle.  No offense to grad students, but as a whole, they can be idiosyncratic.  

Princeton isn't a typical college town with restaurants and bars that cater to the students.  (The undergrads mainly stay on campus.)  You may find you have to go to Philadelphia, NY, or New Brunswick to get the experience of going to bars and concerts and being around other people in their 20's and 30's.that doesn't sound too bad... to my knowledge every other school in america is like this: the undergrad and the grads live in separate social atmospheres. when i was an undergrad i only ever interacted with grad students through my lab group

do you feel like you miss out on anything though? like maybe some events or opportunities that only undergrads have? in what way specifically does admin "care" about you less? sorry lol i just have trouble understanding how specifically any of this is instantiated in your daily life (besides that you're not going to be welcome in the eating clubs or chilling in the undergraduate residences)It's honestly not too bad, Princeton treats its grad students pretty well. However, it's important to note that this social scene I talk about is one of the major draws of Princeton as an institution. So though us not interfacing with it is to be expected, and isn't really a "negative" of the school, we miss out on the "positive" of it, if that makes any sense.

>Do you feel like you miss out on anything

The undergraduates have a world of events and clubs and stuff that I really, honestly, do not have time for. I think the general fact that the prestige of schools levels out more from undergrad to grad school means that grad school is less prestigious than undergrad. It's hard for me to quantify what opportunity you are particularly missing doing grad school here rather than undergrad because they're very different worlds, but both generally set you up pretty well for a good career path from what I've seen.

>In what way does admin "care" about you less

Admin keeps very close track of the undergraduates and the school manages them a lot more directly. They were locked down a lot more intensely during late covid while we were basically allowed to do whatever as long as we kept testing regularly.Ah yea I see what you mean. I think you could probably go to the events like all the dance and music stuff they have going on if you found time. I noticed that grad students don’t really hang in frist or murray-dodge. I wonder why that is since it seems pretty fun. I feel like there’s always time for this kind of stuff, I was personally much more busy in undergrad taking so many classes. I’m not an experimentalist though, so it could be different for people not doing pure theory. 
Princeton seems to have a bunch of cool clubs but yea it would probably weird if a grad student joined because you’d be the only one lol. Might be normal as a G1 but I’m sure undergrads would find a 27 year old G5 creepy. 
What do you do outside of research if I may ask? Just chill in the dbar and on Nassau? That seems like it could get boring fast.. maybe groups of grad students hit up the on campus events and frist and Murray-dodge and Firestone library?Grad students already have a bunch of events, but our events mostly focus around academics (i.e. colloquiums, departmental events, etc). We don't tend to go to the undergrad events because we don't really want to socialize with the undergrads (I have very little to talk about with teenagers, no offense to them) so we don't go, even if we're technically allowed to. I eat lunch in Frist sometimes with other grad students but don't 

Many of us also have already have developed an identity and associated hobbies for ourselves outside of school that takes up a lot of our time. I personally spend my free time playing competitive pokemon (hence my reddit history...lol), working out, and just having casual hangouts with my friends online or in-person. I hope to get back into DnD and cooking in the future.Nice I also play competitive PokémonLol are you a current grad student here? There's quite a few of us who play pokemon regularly.Nope lol..

I hope to get back into DnD and cooking in the future.What resources…If 5 percent of Princeton is grad students and the grad students receive 5 percent of princetons resources, and 40 percent of Harvard is grad students and the grad students there get 40 percent of Harvard resources, the grad school experience at the two should be the same right? So is this not the case?Lol are you a current grad student here? There's quite a few of us who play pokemon regularly.Nope lol..

We have a 6 year old and a baby.

I am from the midwest and completely unfamiliar with NJ. Can anyone give some insight as to what towns/areas to scope out for housing within a reasonable commute from the University? Or areas to avoid. We are looking for safe, quiet, family-friendly areas near good schools (prefer house/townhouse over apartments or condos). I'm a speech therapist and he will be in academics, so we are pretty solid middle class. 

Thanks in advance!!The area around Princeton is generally pretty safe, you could find some place in the town (though housing prices are insane, I think the average is abt 1 mil 🤠). Outside of Princeton the prices are still high but better, Montgomery and west Windsor are both pretty great places with great school districts and Cranbury is nice as well. Also I’m pretty sure the University can provide housing for faculty so I would ask around.Checking it out now, thank you!!There should be faculty housing. Try that until you get a feel for the area.Just went through this myself, with an 8-year-old. If you can afford to buy or like to rent, stick with Princeton area. I’ve driven around the state over the past year. Hopewell is a nice community in the country. Yardley is a great option in Pennsylvania. I personally think Bordentown is great and more affordable. Cranbury is nice but zero homes. That’s the biggest problem right now. Homes go on sale and are immediately bought. The schools in NJ are the best ranked in the US, but they look pretty miserable and underfunded to me no matter where I look.Look at South Brunswick. A lot or good family friendly communities. Much more value for money compared to West Windsor. Good school district as well. Another town is Franklin Park but the schools are not good per the rating.Hillsborough, just about 35 minutes north of Princeton, is a great option.  Very family friendly, rural community with a huge school system very much in need for additional speech therapists. PM me if you want more details.Checking it out now, thank you!!Question about STEM and Language Placement TestingHey ya'll! I'm an upcoming student at Princeton intending to do a BSE in MechE. In high school, I took AP Chem, but received a 2 on the exam (oof). I didn't take Physics 2,  Physics C Mechanics, or E&M (school didn't offer), but I took AP Physics 1 and received a 5 (as far as I know, this doesn't matter, but let me know if I'm wrong). I'm hoping to skip out of the chem requirement (chem 201 or 207) and maybe even the physics requirement (physics 103 and 104), and I was wondering if I'm still allowed to do the STEM placement testing for physics (since I didn't take Physics C) and for chem (since I received a 2 on the AP exam). I looked at the website and I still need some clarity since there are quite a few conditions that they mention. 

If I'm eligible to do either exam, what resources do you recommend I self-study with, and what textbooks does Princeton use for these courses?

Also, I'm eligible to do the language placement exam (took Spanish for 4 years),  and I was wondering what sources I should use to refresh. 

Thank you!Speaking as someone who skipped a calculus class by APing out of it, I actually wish I had taken that calc class so I would have been more prepared for calc 2 at the college level. As it was, I wasn't really prepared for the intensity and rigor of a college mathematics class and starting with one I'd already kind of done would have been a boon.

Best of luck!Adding onto this, it’s important to note that AP Physics 1 is algebra-based physics (PHY103 and PHY104 are calculus-based), and only covers like 3/4 of PHY103 (it doesn’t include Kepler’s laws or waves, and just generally has less depth) and none of PHY104 (which is electricity and magnetism, electronics, and optics). You may be able to self-study to skip out of PHY103 (I’d recommend reading Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Tipler and Mosca if you choose to do so), but I agree with @bc_127; biting the bullet and taking them will probably serve you best in the long run. Your future Princeton classes will require a very thorough understanding PHY103/104 material.Congrats on being accepted! Skipping out of intro classes is a good idea. I placed out of physics through placement exam, chemistry through AP, very glad I did. Be aware that physics placement test is very difficult, much more difficult than AP physics c, which already is quite challenging. Your experience in Ap physics 1 probably won’t be comparable, to feel comfortable, try the MIT OCW physics materials. It is not easy to place out unless you are very comfortable with physics, plus, if you are MechE, you probably want a strong physics background so sticking with intro classes might not be a bad idea. 

For chemistry, I used AP credit so not sure how difficult the placement exam is. Would recommend emailing the department head or the chem placement officer (find it through the website), my guess is you should feel very comfortable with the AP chen material.

Anyone can take the placement tests, regardless of class background, just beware they are quite difficult.

BSE kids do not need a foreign language so it is not necessary to place out of language if you are set on BSE. I tried French after taking a couple years of French and with a 4 on the AP test and basically bombed, it is quite specific on grammar and comprehension. If you somehow manage to ace it, I believe you will need to do an interview to officially place out of the 100 level Spanish classes. In other words, very difficult again.Adding onto this, it’s important to note that AP Physics 1 is algebra-based physics (PHY103 and PHY104 are calculus-based), and only covers like 3/4 of PHY103 (it doesn’t include Kepler’s laws or waves, and just generally has less depth) and none of PHY104 (which is electricity and magnetism, electronics, and optics).

Here is the original message from their previous post retyped as they deleted it:"The FSI scam that everyone was suggesting was a scam as usual. It was $3500 for two classes during the summer for everyone fucking year. This funding this year, however, was a fucking meme of $350. WTF. Like actually wtf. Why target poor kids. I already don't want to be here and will likely end up like the other two people who offed themselves this past week if I go.

I mean fuck. Why? Am i the asshole here? Yale is giving over $1k for their comparable summer program shit and Stanford, etc are probably much more. So Why? I am in hell."

Let's do a cost breakdown right now of going to Princeton versus Yale for example. Yale's program actually only gives a $250 stipend. The number that they are quoting is reflective of the "summer savings contribution", which Princeton got rid of years ago because it disproportionately affected low-income students.

Beyond this, EFC 0 students at Yale still have to pay $1,600 every year unless, unless they do fsy (which only waives this cost in the first year). On the other hand, Princeton requires zero student contribution for the entirety of the education if you're EFC 0.

If you're curious as to why students previously received a larger stipend, but are receiving a lower one now, that is because that $3500 is ONLY reflective of the stipend over COVID. Students who took FSI over COVID had to take it from home, so this was to offset housing, books, and meal costs. However, at FSI in-person, there are 3-meals a day provided, a dorm room, and all educational resources covered. You are getting PAID to get taught two separate courses, which furthers your own educational career. Princeton is an educational institution, not a full-time job. Their focus is not to make you wealthy, it's to educate you. Be grateful about this, many FLI students have to pay and go into debt for such an experience.

Going further, the user also made this comment (here is an excerpt):

"THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE COME HERE IS THE FUCKING MONEY... WHY DOES EVERY . FUCKING. OTHER. IVY. CARE FOR THEIR FUCKING STUDENTS."

I genuinely don't understand this point. Princeton is marketed as an educational institution, and I would wager a larger part of the fame of Princeton is around the ideals and education than the money (although I do not discredit the large endowment to student ratio is beneficial to the educational opportunities). An educational institution's job is to educate you, not pay you a full-time wage to go to the school. I can't really understand the privileged position this person is in, as they feel entitled to such an experience. I will say this as a matter of fact, NO school is going to give you the experience you seek. At MIT, at Yale, at any other school you will not be catered too as if you are some expensive commodity. They are giving you the opportunity of upward mobility, do you not see this?

Sorry for the long message all, but I thought I ought to publicly address some of this person's comments to give a full perspective to any other FGLI student who intend to come here. This person's experience is NOT representative of the truth. I am an FGLI student, I applied through Questbridge, and my experience as Princeton is not perfect. However, Princeton's FGLI resources have provided me the opportunity to be on a level playing field with students with significantly more preparation than I. I went to a school where they did not even teach Calculus, but I am able to go through the Physics curriculum because FSI gave me a head start.

And one could argue that if to utilize these resources I must sacrifice my mental health due to difficulty to gain access to these resources / terrible staff, I would understand. However, this is not the case at Princeton. The staff at the Emma Bloomberg Center for Access and Inclusion (EBCAO) are some of the best people I have met in my entire life, and they will go leaps and bounds to make sure you have everything you want.

However, there is a difference between being an FGLI student who needs to lean on EBCAO for support, and someone who feels entitled to it all. This student does, and their actions and posts point to this. Do not trust what they say.  


Edit: GrammarHey! Just wanted to say thanks so much for sharing this. As a first gen alum whose education was heavily, heavily subsidized by financial aid, I was getting worried we were falling behind other peer schools / had issues but couldn’t find anything else. 


I know we still have a long way to go in making Princeton accessible for everyone but appreciate you sharing that it isn’t as dire as others make it seem. 

Good luck with the rest of your Princeton career! It’ll fly by. 🐅A.B vs B.S.E programCould someone please explain the B.S.E program and the benefits it holds as opposed to a regular bachelor’s degree?Which is easier depends on your background. For me, switching AB to BSE meant making an appointment to meet the dean, then signing a paper. That was it.

If you don't do the prereqs, then it's certainly harder. On the other hand, AB majors don't have to write an extra essay when applying.If you want to be some type of engineer in the future, you would need a BSE. Otherwise I don't think there is a "benefit" over BSE vs AB. I will say it's easier to start as an engineer and switch out than vice versa (that's what I did)."one semester of independent work" is true for COS but not the other BSE majors.

Note that for distributions, it isn't actually more courses (unless you still need a language) but rather more flexibility. Then they add on more specific/intense math/science requirements.Excellent description. I would add that BSE requires more advanced math and science courses.Oh, thanks, I didn't know that. I think that's changed since I graduated.Bse has no limit on the number of departmental (300+) courses you can take in your major. Bse requires only one semester of independent work, with flexible requirements on the final writeup; ab needs two junior papers and a senior thesis. Bse declares major after year one; ab after year two. 

Distribution requirements are totally different as well; bse requires a handful of humanities courses that can come from almost anywhere, while ab students have a wide variety of distribution courses that need to be satisfied for a well rounded liberal arts education.No one in the real world cares what your degree is called.. the BS vs BSE vs AB standards different from school to school and some schools don’t even offer them all (I think Dartmouth only awards ABs and Caltech only awards BS). What’s most useful to you in life is: 
the material you learn (and learning the ability to learn complex things quickly)  > the connections you make, alumni network >> the school you went to > your major >> everything else
Just choose bse vs ab at Princeton based on wha the requirements for each are and which you’d rather do. I think the cos bse doesn’t require a senior thesis? The only other thing I would say is that no matter what you choose I would always recommend to do the senior thesis. It’s an incredible experience if you find an advisor you likeBSE concentrators have a 20% higher rate of bursting spontaneous into brimstone and tears for no reason in particular during Dean's DateWhich is easier depends on your background.

Summer can be a lonely time on campus so I figured it would be make sense to post this

About me: I'm into technology and business growth. I like listening to podcast about venture capital and artificial intelligence. Self driving cars and other technological developments. I also enjoy nature a lot and do a fair amount of nature trails. Aside from that I have really just been exploring my home state of New Jersey a lot more as of late. Finding the hidden gems in the state is kind of fun like really good restaurants and unique stores

I'm relatively extroverted and rather calm. Also in the process of making a technology social group where we share cool articles and discuss them in person and online. I like to build things especially things that bring people together. Have already had a decent amount of success with this and will continue to do it. I also have a pretty large network of friends already and would be happy to include you in some of the things we do if we vibe together. DM me if you want and we can talk a bit and exchange social mediaThat shit was funny as hell. But I'm not sure if you're trying to use it as an insult. If so that's pretty stupid.

Hockey?I'm an incoming freshman at Princeton. I learned to play ice hockey in high school and got pretty okay at it. I was always just on my school's JV team but I really liked the sport and wanted to continue it in college. Obviously I'm not good enough to play on the actual hockey team but I was wondering if I could still play at a lower level? Is there a women's/co-ed intramural or club team? I know there's a club hockey team, and their Campus Recreation webpage says they take all ability levels, but their website makes it seem like they're pretty high level and a men's team. Also, how time-consuming are club sports/intramurals in general?Thanks for the info! Even if I can't play hockey specifically I'm still interested in some of the other sports groups, so this is good to know.Check out rugby! Men’s and women’s club. Two practices a week and Saturday matches. Few new players have ever played before getting to PU.Intramurals is very low time commitment / intensity — just go to the games, show up as you are and have fun! 

Club I would say is more similar to a lower version of a high school varsity team - a few practices a week, travel somewhat to play other schools locally, etc. Much more of a team vibe. 

I’m not sure about hockey opportunities specifically, sorry. But good luck!Check out rugby! Men’s and women’s club. Two practices a week and Saturday matches.

I think it doesn't make much sense for me to buy these things only to get rid of them after a semester. I'd be glad if someone knows something!What all do you recommend should I buy second hand from the website.Depends on what you needDepends on what you needAre the chairs given by college good or should I get one from here?

I have to move to Princeton in like a week for a summer internship and I still haven't found a place to live! So if you know anybody that's got an empty room this summer, please let me know. I'm clean and friendly and I don't have any pets. 

Really looking forward to my summer in Princeton, btw!There are some on tigertrade you could contactCould you tell a little bit about yourself. You can DM me I have a roomThe Weeknd Concert TicketsHey everyone, I’m trying to sell some tickets for The Weeknd concert at MetLife Stadium on July 16. I have 6 tickets that I’m tryna sell and am able to send them over through Ticketmaster. Message me if interested.
Thanks!incoming freshman studying ORFE advice/tips?hello! i'm heading to pt in the fall (class of '26) and applied as an orfe major. I've always liked math and want to go into finance but i have very little experience with math competitions/cos. 

in high school, i was super business orientated. i made 501c3 and did lots of debate but i'm super nervous i can't handle the level of math. btw i'm taking mv calc and diff eq right now.  

any advice on any books/study material/gen advice is appreciated!!thanks so much for the advice!It’s hard to know until you start! I’d say definitely pay attention in lectures, precepts, go to office hours, McGraw for tutoring/support. And recognize that there isn’t anything wrong with changing majors if it ends up not being your cup of tea! You can 1000% get a business job without being an ORFE major, unless there’s a super specific one you want. With you liking debate, I could see you enjoying Econ or SPIA too - something that is math and more policy too.

Enjoy!!!It should be renamed IEOR like all other schools.Happy to chat more if you’d like OP, feel free to PM. The math won’t be too easy but if you feel comfortable in Calc and Diff EQ you will be fine. The more important question is whether or not you actually want to do study ORFE. Be aware that this major could just as easily be named Operations research and industrial engineering. All of a sudden, it’s probably way less interesting. 

Would encourage you to not view ORFE as just more mathy economics, and there are not many more opportunities that ORFE would open that economics wouldn’t. By contrast, CS would perhaps open quite a few more doors. Source: ORFE turned COS ‘25You’re more than qualified and you’ll do fine. barely anyone has experience with math compsthanks so much for the advice!It should be renamed IEOR like all other schools.Proposal at East Pyne Hall on Saturday 5/21 eveningIf anyone happened to be around East Pyne Hall on Saturday 5/21 evening (at 8pm) and witnessed a guy (me) proposing to his then-girlfriend (it was an Indian proposal, if it helps), I'd sincerely appreciate any videos or pictures you'd be able to send me! Or even forward this to anyone you know who was there. I have some photos, but was so wrapped up in the moment that I didn't think to ask if anyone who was around happened to take a video.   


I realize it's a long shot, but figured it wouldn't hurt to try. If you could spread the word that I'm looking, would also appreciate that! 

  
Btw, it turned out great! My now-fiancé & I are ecstatic :)Congrats !!!!Congratulations!!It already happened thoughThat famed Cornell reading comprehension.WAIT SERIOUSLY? DamnUhm. Cornellian here.

DamnLaptop recommendations for CS?I'm shopping around for a new laptop. The biggest factor for me is software compatibility with course curriculums. What are some recommendations?I only took 126 and 226 and I was fine in those classes with windows, but everything was absolutely geared towards Mac/unix>126 and 226

Are these the only 2 classes that you take in cs as a freshman in AB COS major?No one is an ab cos major until their third year. 

That being said, you can take whatever you want, as long as your advisor signs off on it. I skipped 126 and took 217, 226, 333, 341, 324, and 494 in year one.

This was a few moons ago so numbers may have changed cause I'm old afTL;DR Having an Apple computer can make things easier for you if you're not confident using Windows already 

Disclaimer, I am an ex-cos major and don't have a super deep understanding of what goes on under the hood for a computer. But iirc a lot of class assignments are done from the command line, and the most support is given with unix commands, which is v straightforward on an Apple computer. If you're using Windows/DOS commands, you may be more on your own. Though Windows 10 has pretty good support for running unix shells, it's still a bit confusing for me; this may not be an issue if you have a basic understanding of operating systems lol

In my time, everyone I knew did their work in Linux or macOS. When, for example, COS 333 has you adding features to a Unix program from the 70s a Unix-based OS is just easier. In industry, Macs are dominant as well as developer laptops go so it’s also a simpler transition if your plan is to go into industry. 

The university has a laptop purchasing program by the way which I believe lets you get a discounted laptop if you’re on financial aid.>126 and 226

(In a summer)Hello Princeton community!

I am an incoming intern for the summer of 2022. I will be doing some work at the GFDL, and I can't wait to immerse myself in the Princeton community. First, some logistics: 

\- I will be staying from June 13th - August 6th.

\- I will have a vehicle on campus

\- Will be staying in the "Joline" dorms

\- Will be on some kind of meal plan 

\- Will have a good amount of free time on the weekends!

I just wanted to consult with you all to see if I could get any "insider" information about Princeton. What are some things that I should totally do before I move out in August? Any tips for the best places to study? Are there any events on the weekend that I should keep my eye out for? In short, what should an 8-week summer intern know about Princeton University? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!Astrophysics / Astronomy at Princeton?Any high school opportunities for non-US citizens in Princeton in astronomy and astrophysics? Thank you!
I adore Princeton and the community. Glad mediums like reddit exist to connect with it :)Still buying graduation commencement tickets!I can meet up in person, I’m on campus! I will buy each ticket for $20What's the difference between upperclassman housing and residential college?I'm doing an exchange at Princeton next semester. I've been asked to choose between residential college and upperclassman housing. Is there a price difference? Which option do you recommend and why? Is it possible to get access to the kitchen? (PS: I have already read all the information I could find on the Princeton website)Not OP, but want to say thanks for your reply, because it was very informative. Thanks again.The dining meal plan is quite expensive; at least when I was there, living in a res college meant you were required to have a dining meal plan, which set you back several thousand dollars if you were cooking your meals yourself anyway.Glad it was helpful! :)They actually just changed it this year - upperclassmen living in res colleges are no longer required to get a meal plan.

To respond to OP’s other questions, at least to Princeton students, the price is the same, and there’s a lot of variation within each option. The newer residential colleges (New College West, Yeh, Whitman, Butler) are overall nicer than most upperclass housing, while the older ones (Rocky, Mathey, Forbes) are similar. Both have shared kitchens you can get access to, but the details vary by dorm. If I were you, I would go for res college, because your odds of getting a decent room are better imo, but I doubt it will make a big difference.Ooh, is it required for upper class men living in res colleges? I didn’t know. Great call out!Finally! They were considering mandating that all students not in eating clubs have dining meal plans, regardless of where they lived. I went to several meetings they had to say that was an atrocious idea. Glad they're finally extending it to res colleges, too!Hey!

Biggest difference is age of people living in them. Residential college will be largely 18-20 year olds (freshman and sophomores), and Upper class dorms will be 20-22 year olds.

Additionally, res colleges have more structure and have an associated dining hall. They will have events at the dining hall/dorm, you’ll have an RCA (like a dorm advisor), and in general a little more structure. Depending on which res college you’re in, you may be able to walk to the dining hall without going outdoors (nice in winter!) whereas this isn’t an option for the upper class dorms. Another factor is location - upper class dorms are more central to campus (in general). 

In terms of kitchens, res colleges will have a common kitchen you can use, but it would be hard to cook regularly in it on your own I think. Some upper classman dorms (Spellman) are like normal apartments, with a private kitchen — these are popular and possibly not available to you, but are easiest setup for cooking on your own. There are also co-ops in upper class dorms where people use a common or dedicated kitchen to take turns cooking that would probably be open to you - but I think you’d have to wait to learn more / sign up until you are on campus. I don’t think there is a price difference, though dining hall meal plans are a significant difference across plans you can choose from.

Is there a reason you want to cook on your own? Quite common to just eat in dining halls.

I have heard that if one selects upperclassman housing, there might be a kitchen, or not. Since I'm on a diet, I'd like to cook for myself at least half of the time. Is that possible? Also, I've heard about co-opts, how does that work? Can exchange students be part of a co-opt?Spelman has kitchens.  In my day 2 Dickinson was a coop.  Probably there are more options nowadays.Upperclass housing only has communal kitchens, and not every building has one. You should specify to housing that you want to be placed in a building with a kitchen.

Spelman is not part of upperclass housing proper, so I doubt that’s an option for you. Don’t know if exchange students can join co-ops, but I’m sure you can email the co-ops and ask.Oh nice! How can I join a co-op? Also in addition to the semester cost, do we have to pay for food or do we use this money to purchase food together?I would contact them directly to ask about joining, you should be able to find the info on the link I included above. For 2D the semester fee covered food (bulk order is a beautiful thing!!)Thank you very much!! :)) Btw this is really much cheaper than the meal plan and it would be ideal if I could joinI would mention that you are an exchange student and would only need to join for one semester! It might make a difference if they are otherwise full :) Good luck, and enjoy Princeton!!I was in a co-op and loved it (2D). I can't imagine that they wouldn't let you join for a semester. Depending on your dietary constraints though a co-op might not be right for you... the idea is that everyone cooks a dish once a week for the entire co-op to ease the burden of cooking and also have a small community to eat/socialize with. You could use their kitchen at off hours but that's not really the point of joining! https://odus.princeton.edu/odus-programs/dining-eating-clubs-and-co-opsI would contact them directly to ask about joining, you should be able to find the info on the link I included above.

What are your jobs now?I was a COS major so I can't speak to how the ORFE undergrad experience is, but I asked one of my friends (class of '20) for a general breakdown of the 2020 ORFE class's jobs!

* roughly half of his class is in finance (quant trading, investment banking)
* a "good chunk" of students in data science-y jobs
* some consultants
* some "regular" software engineers
* a few in academia

Something that I brought was an electric kettle which I pretty much used daily for coffee, tea, and making soups and comes in handy when the dining hall is closed. You might find a lot of this stuff at the “Resale” Princeton does in the beginning of the year but it gets real hectic. I personally ordered some of this stuff off of Amazon, which you can always do if you need things. :)You bring seasoning with you the dining hall?Spices/Seasoning. Dining hall food is bland asfA good umbrella! As someone who grew up in a town where if it was raining, you took a car, I didn’t realize how insufficient raincoats would be when I was walking 15m to class in rain. Also, waterproof shoes/boots.

I'm a student at Michigan, and I'm going to be doing an internship at Johnson & Johnson over the summer. I was looking for housing around the Princeton area, and I was wondering if anyone here had any good resources for finding sublets, or if anyone has had any luck with any Facebook groups or stuff like that.

Any help is appreciated!!Sometimes sublets will show up on Tigertrade

I've been told by a few friends who have lived up North before that I need a four wheel/all wheel drive car because of the snow (I've never driven in snow!!) but was wondering what you all think, and whether it is necessary or not! Also if you all have any other cars recs for driving up North and in colder weather :) Thanks!thank you!No you don’t need 4wd. There might be one or two days a year when it’s bad enough that you would need it but if it gets that bad you probably shouldn’t be out driving anyways. Any normal car that runs will workthanks!>thanks!

You're welcome!A regular sedan or SUV will work fine in NJ. You don't need 4WD or snow tires or anything. Depending on where you're housing, you may just want to bike to work--I lived on/near campus and only used a car to go food shopping but other grad students with families lived in west Windsor which is cheap and they needed cars.I moved from FL 1 year ago and heard the same thing, mostly from other Floridians-that if I didn't get some bland Subaru 8 wheel drive box, then I'd never be mobile in winter,

Bought a rear wheel drive Miata and no issues at all. NJ townships in most areas reliable plow snow and our winters are relatively mild. Get whatever you want.thank you!>thanks!

You're welcome!thanks!>thanks!

You're welcome!Transfer credit evaluationI just got accepted to Princeton as a transfer today! (Yay) 

Are there any transfer students here that I could message about the credit evaluation? I have nearly 60 credits at a California community college, but I received my preliminary credit evaluation and they’re only accepting 3 courses. Can I appeal it and get it reevaluated? Thanks in advance guys!Thank you so much I’m so excitedCongrats!!! Princeton takes very few transfers so a) EXTRA CONGRATS!! and b) it may be tough to get an answer here!

I’d say it doesn’t hurt to appeal! Princeton in general is always open to a discussion but I wouldn’t be that surprised if they don’t accept more credits — they can be sticklers in general on stuff like this.

Welcome to the family! 🐅🐅Thank you so much for your insight I’ll definitely keep that in mind! Did you appeal by any chance?I did not appeal. Starting as a sophomore is the best anybody will get, which I had, so the decision was just whether I wanted to stay as one or not.

Again, doesn’t hurt you to ask though. Worst they can say is no.Hi there! I’m a current transfer here at Princeton. 
While you can definitely appeal for your credit transfer, I also would say that not having as many credits as you expected isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

Princeton is a special place. I had enough credits to start as a sophomore but chose to restart as a freshman and I’m glad I did. There’s a lot of amazing opportunities here and im glad I’m getting to spend 4 years here. Just something to think about, and we certainly hope to see you here in the fall!Thank you!!You're welcome! And congratulations, hope to see you around!You can also contact Dr. Keith Shaw for some friendly help on this matter - he works directly with transfer students to make the process easier https://sifp.princeton.edu/people/keith-shawCongratulations! I was notified that I was put on the wait list. Any transfers here have experience with that? I know that getting in on transfer is difficult enough.Yup go for it!Thanks!Congrats on getting accepted! Could I DM you and ask for a few details about your transfer application, what you did in CC, etc.?Thank you so much I’m so excitedI did not appeal.

Just contact Mudd and have someone do it for you. I used to do scan requests as a student worker. I’m sure if you explain the urgency, they can prioritize it (either with or without a fee).Thanks so much for the advice!

|-|-|-|-|anyone know where/if I can park my car next semester?Current freshman. I live about 90 minutes away from campus and I go home frequently, anywhere from 2 to 3 times a month. It's super troublesome to take public transport (takes twice as long) and I want to bring my car to princeton so I can drive back. However, I know that it is very rare for princeton to grant parking permits. Does anyone have any advice?Find a grad student who doesn’t have a car and ask them to get you a grad student parking permit so you can park at the lakeside garage. Either that or go look on tigertrade/Craigslist/Nextdoor and people in the surrounding neighborhood sometimes rent out parking spots at their house at a monthly rate.Usually Princeton only grants permits to undergrads for medical reasons but it’s worth a shot. It’s a bit of a hassle but I park my car in west garage during the day and move it onto the street at night. You may be able to park in west garage for extended periods of time if you park on the 3rd or 4th floor, I doubt they check up there.There's a car park nearby for I think $800 a yearMove Out/ Parking near BlairI’m moving out later this week and live in Blair. I’m not sure where to have my parents park. I was thinking of the following options:

1) they could just pull up in front of the building like during move-in. They would have to drive up Elm Drive but I heard that access to Blair drive is limited
2) enter via Nassau but again I think that gate is always closed
3) park in Lot 8 or on University Place

I’d prefer option 1 due to the weight of some items but would they need a permit or could they enter campus from somewhere else besides Elm?Just tell the guard that you’re moving out and your room number and building and they’ll give you a temp passI made a playlist of 7 hours of chill synth music to lift you up and motivate you while studying.

I am an incoming graduate student and I am looking for backup housing (in case I get assigned a shared bedroom). Does anyone know of any affordable apartment complexes/areas where I could rent a 1-BR apartment at a reasonable price? I don't mind commuting. 

Thanks!This is what you want:

Welcome to the grad school!Princeton junction and Plainsboro are two good for off campus housing, that will only be a 10- 15 minute drive to campus. Good luck!Thanks for all your replies! Will check out these resources/neighborhoods.Unfortunately yes. The university uses a lottery system and you may be assigned to a shared bedroom if your preferences cannot be accommodated.Whoa, grad students are sharing bedrooms now?Unfortunately yes.

This is an odd request, but I have been searching the internet for months for an archive of a specific Korean television show and found that Princeton has an archive of the channel I'm looking for:  
[https://library.princeton.edu/news/eastasian/2018-10-08/mbc-archive-korean-television-archive](https://library.princeton.edu/news/eastasian/2018-10-08/mbc-archive-korean-television-archive)

If anyone is willing to download and send the files for the 500th episode of the TV show Wednesday Art Stage (수요예술무대) I would be extraordinarily grateful. If there is a better place to ask for this, please point me in that direction.Thank you!Have you found anything about this?I’ll see what I can doThank you!Have you found anything about this?astrophysics major please help. hi. I will be attending Princeton this year as an astrophysics major. is there any advice before starting?Thank you so much for your time and response ❤️1. Don’t be intimidated by the first two years of math/physics, the astrophysics classes come junior/senior year and are GREAT so stick it out for the cool stuff to come later!
2. Try to find summer research work with one of the astrophysics professors after your freshman year
3. The Astro department is full of odd personalities. Embrace it and get to know the professors and students. Go to the Friday afternoon department meetups even as a freshman and don’t be shy.Thank you so much. I really appreciate your response. I have a question it is simple but weird and important. If you studied/ completed the assignments/ attended and also followed the professor's advices would you still have an A for example in such hard courses?For reference, I was very unprepared as I went into PHY105 and MAT203 having self-studied both AP Physics C and Calc BC and I was NOT prepared at all. I could have taken PHY103 instead and probably have gotten an A-/B+ without a whole lot of extra effort, as I was very familiar with the content already. I came into PHY105 and struggled greatly in the first half, and got a class-low score on the midterm. I did much better in the second half, and got a C+ overall (I was probably near the bottom of the class with a C in the first half, but doing pretty well with a B-/B in the second half). Had I been using my resources consistently, I probably could have ended the course with a B-, but again I was vastly underprepared (this was my first physics class ever with a teacher that wasn’t the internet), and students who were more prepared than me coming in got grades in the A/A- range. I feel like many freshman STEM classes are just “How much did your high school prepare you?”, and the amount of effort you put in pushes your grade up/down a notch from that. You can only do so much catching up to get used to Princeton Physics’ pace, so be proud of yourself if you keep up quickly and get an A, but don’t knock yourself down if you are immensely struggling just to get a B. It all evens out by sophomore year for the most part. Plus, nearly everyone suffers in that class anyways, regardless of grade, so you won’t ever feel alone! 

I wouldn’t worry about grades too much in the first year. Focus on learning and understanding in physics, and you’ll be more prepared for getting a better grade in the next class! (Also just FYI Astro classes are generally easier than the physics classes, so far my Astro classes have been “oh yeah I should try extra hard to get that A-, I’m very close!” whereas some physics classes are just a lost cause, but it’s different for everybody and varies generally).

Kinda rambly but hope this helps lol, freshman year made me want to drop out and quit everything, so brace yourself!Sorry for the late reply but thank you so much for this. I really appreciate itFreshman year will be hell but that’s okay, don’t be intimidated if you die in physics/math, if you’re starting in PHY105, I strongly encourage you to not drop to PHY103, even if you’re struggling in 105 and think that it would be better to drop down—I ended up staying in it despite struggling very badly, but I was able to pull through and did not regret taking a class that was above my skill level coming into freshman year. I fell in love with physics in that class even tho it killed my GPA. Also go to office hours and study sessions, as the class is impossible without them. Don’t be afraid to drop down in math if you must to survive in physics, math here is not taught great at all and the goal is mainly to survive until you’re finished than to actually learn anything. The hardest part is getting through freshman year, if you can do that, you can do anything! 

Also, be aware that many Astro classes are only offered EVERY OTHER YEAR, so plan ahead! Unlike other majors, the requirements are plentiful for Astro, so make sure you have a decent idea of when you’re going to take stuff. Talk to other people in the department as much as you can, and ALWAYS have multiple sets of eyes see your schedule to make sure it’s good.

Overall, the classes are overbearing and stressful but the community is full of the nicest, most supportive people you’ll ever meet. Use your resources, and you’ll be fine. Get in touch with Neta Bahcall and Polly Strauss, they would LOVE to talk to you about the department and all of the research and opportunities we have. They’re always happy to see people interested in Astro (our department is very small, so new people are always welcome)! Everyone I’ve talked to is so kind, supportive, and passionate about astrophysics, so get to know them ASAP!!!I know some of your classes early on are no joke, but see if you can learn some cs, either now or early on. It'll probably help with research.I’d just like to comment that PHY105 and MAT203 are NOT required or even necessary to be an astro major (coming from someone who took PHY103 and MAT201). There’s a lot of pressure to follow the higher track that’s offered, but as others have said, it all evens out in sophomore year. Yes, PHY105 will give you a bit of a leg up in part of PHY205 sophomore year, but by the time you get to PHY208 in the spring, it’s totally new material for everyone. Additionally, I’ve seen PHY105 turn several people away from physics/astro unfortunately, because of the sheer difficulty; if you can see that happening, just go with PHY103! It’s certainly not worth sacrificing your passion for a topic just for the sake of following a higher track that nobody outside of Princeton will care about.Thank you so much for your time and response ❤️For reference, I was very unprepared as I went into PHY105 and MAT203 having self-studied both AP Physics C and Calc BC and I was NOT prepared at all.

I was recently accepted into pt and will be joining the class of '26. I've been studying up on APs but I'm not sure which ones I need to take/give me credit. 

Does anyone know the difference between units of credit vs princeton courses replaced? I got a 5 in AP US History but what does "one unit of AP" give me? I'm considering taking the European history test this Friday but unsure if it means anything? 

btw I'm planning to study in the engineering department. idk if that helps

[https:\/\/odoc.princeton.edu\/advancedplacement ](https://preview.redd.it/a7jxex94bbx81.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=024694c1831f803c382ed44d5d02648a70f329ec)Yeah to add on to this, for example in engineering for a BSE you need 4 “units of AP” (2 physics, 1 math, 1 chem) to have “advanced standing” and graduate in 3.5 years. I’m guessing similar rules apply to AB students. This is the only way you *reduce* your course load, otherwise “courses replaced” simply means you meet a prerequisite and can start at a higher level (none of these courses in your image meet this, but something like Calculus can “replace” MAT 103 and you can start in MAT 201). Sorry this is math focused but that’s what I’m doing lolah ok tysm!if an AP test has "no equivalent course" under the "courses replaced" column, it means that it does not satisfy any course requirement (i.e. it doesn't take the place of any course). an example of an AP test that _does_ satisfy a requirement is a 5 on AP chemistry, which you can use to replace CHM207 (meaning you don't have to take CHM207 at all).

i believe that a "unit of AP" is applicable if you plan to take advantage of advanced standing, which allows you to graduate in <8 semesters.Yeah to add on to this, for example in engineering for a BSE you need 4 “units of AP” (2 physics, 1 math, 1 chem) to have “advanced standing” and graduate in 3.5 years.

Can you send a link to the source?I think OP mean OP themselves is the source (they are a PhD student or knows one)Oh alr 🙃You may have a hard time finding a job in aerospace engineering. The state schools are the ones with the actual connections to companies where you might want to work. A Princeton degree may be useful at private aerospace companies. 

But, a Princeton degree still holds value and will open doors for you, just giving a heads up that it’s not quite the landscape you think it is out there. State schools hold a lot of clout at government aerospace companies. And people may think you are over-qualified coming into it with a degree from Princeton. 

Source : Princeton PhD from the MAE department.Just try to do as much project based learning as you can, and look for summer research positions at Princeton the summer after freshman year (yes, I know it’s early, but it will help you create a relationship with a professor and make you more likely to get an internship other summers).In what ways is grad different from undergrad? Does admin care more about the undergrads? How so specifically?How are you committed to a major before you even start? Go in with the interest, sure, but don't hesitate to flex as you learn more.

To your question, ignore other commenter (undergrad is vastly different than grad), there are Tigers in all manner of aerospace, public and private. Not sure if you get access once you start or only after graduation, but either way hit up Career Services office and ask them to check the alumni network for people at companies or organizations you might be interested in (Boeing, JPL, etc.). Get contact info and reach out for a quick chat. The networking could be good to circle back for internships later on too.Also, ignore your grades. Some people change major because the (absurd) grade deflation policy means they will get lower grades at more challenging courses that are nonetheless very important, like advanced math. So they leave those courses early in the term, change to "easier" stuff, never challenge themselves in the way that's necessary for real development and achievement. Take those courses even if it starts looking like you'll get suboptimal grades; it's much better to take them and admit to yourself that it will take maybe years to fully assimilate the material, rather than giving up your dream as a whole, in my opinion.you are tired of the princeton superpipe right..I think OP mean OP themselves is the source (they are a PhD student or knows one)Oh alr 🙃Alright, thanks for the insight 😁

Out of curiosity, among the graduates at commencement (not the guests), how do they decide who sits where on the lawn or football field?Could be different now, but when I was there it was a big line and you walked in, in line. So the earlier you get in line, the earlier rows you get.Trying to keep my cat with me, any tips?Hey y'all! I'll be starting my freshman year at Princeton this coming August (Go Tigers!), and I'd like to keep my cat, if at all possible. Both my parents will be moving to China after I settle into the dorms, so my cat's kinda my emotional support line.

I considered having her stay at a pet hotel, but I feel like that wouldn't be super comfy for her, and I'm not sure if any freshman dorms allow pets. Would the best option be to find someone nearby to take care of her for the first two years before I move out of the dorms, or are there other options?Only way to keep a cat in the dorms is if you get paperwork declaring it an emotional support animal, but that might require actual attestation from a therapist. Dunno about pet hotels or any other options like that, but it seems like it would be tough and expensive - it’d be easiest to have your parents take the cat and just visit it when you visit your parents imo.Also just noting that few people ever move out of dorms - not very common at all.It's best to find a therapist, meet several times, and then get approval so they have stuff to write about (ie. why a cat specifically is needed)Here are your options: 

\-Find a therapist to fill out the paperwork for an emotional support animal. This may be difficult, and I've heard that they've rejected certain applications. BUt not sure because I know quite a few people who approved

\-Find a family friend to take care of her for two years 

\-Bring her sophomore year and spend next year getting approval for an emotional support animal

&#x200B;

Also while some people are very allergic to cats, it doesn't become an issue unless you room with them. I have a cat on campus and it's been fine (note: I also have a single dorm so no roommates)You’ll need to get documentation that it’s an emotional support animalmaybe register it as an emotional support animal?many people are very allergic to cats..It's best to find a therapist, meet several times, and then get approval so they have stuff to write about (ie. why a cat specifically is needed)What are some good study spots on campus that don't require a Princeton ID?I live in the area and attend college from home. I don't attend Princeton but it would be nice to have somewhere to study :0 All the academic buildings are locked since Covid but you may be able to get guest access to Firestone. There are meant patios bear Nassau that are really pretty that you could go to though.I’m in a similar boat! My partner attends Princeton so we live in town, but I commute to Columbia two days a week for class. I highly recommend getting a Princeton library card! It’s only a stones throw from Nassau Hall. They have tons of space to study, a good wifi connection, a cafe on the first floor, and it’s free!Prospect Garden is nice especially in spring, and while I can’t officially endorse this, you can probably follow someone into Frist during a crowded time (which is 90% of the time) and use the quiet study spaces on floor 3 or the loud ones on floor AOn weekdays during business hours you can get into New South from the A Level (at least during the school year).  I don’t think you’re ~supposed~ to if you’re a non-Princeton student but I doubt anyone cares lol, it’s a really cool building to study in.All good after receiving Confirmation Email right?Hey all I just wanted to confirm that after I received a confirmation email after filling out the committing form in the portal that all is good? I don’t have to do anything else right? All the NetID, Princeton Email, and other information will be sent out after May 2nd?Yeah you’re good homie, congrats!!Right... my son did thatLOCI for PrincetonI haven't written a LOCI yet for Princeton since I already submitted an update late February and I haven't really done anything significant since. Do you think it'll hurt my chances of getting off the waitlist? They did mention in the letter that no additional information is required and that everything they need is in my file. Do you think I should still submit one anyways?I agree with you, but at some point it becomes a cargo cult 😜From my experience, people who got in off waitlist or after being deferred typically wrote a LOCIyes, I'm confident my LOCI after being deferred got me inI agree with you, but at some point it becomes a cargo cult 😜No deposit required for incoming freshmen?So I committed to Princeton via the form on the applicant portal yesterday (!!!!) but just wanted to double check that Princeton *does not* require a deposit for incoming freshmen. On the reply to admission form it states that "No deposit is required" but I felt I should make sure. Just a bit paranoid as classmates who are going to peer institutions have had to put down deposits at their respective universities.Thank you sm! I did get a confirmation email already so looks like I'm good.Nope, I had the same worries last year. As long as you get a confirmation message, you’re golden.Welcome to the family!! 🐅🐅🐅Thank you sm! I did get a confirmation email already so looks like I'm good.Premed at PrincetonHi everyone! Recent admit here and I just have a few questions. 

How’s premed at Princeton? Is it true that it’s unforgiving because of the harsh grading? Also approx what percentage of people actually stay on the pre med track? 

Thanks!!Current premed here. Princeton no longer has grade deflation. Of course, classes are still difficult, but if you manage your time well and seek help early, you’ll be fine. 

I don’t know the % of people who drop out of premed (you could try asking HPA, our health professions advising office, for that), but anecdotally, the people I knew who dropped out of premed didn’t really want to be doctors anyways and found their passions by being exposed to other fields at princeton. Hope that helps!SPIA on pre-med?So I know it sounds kind of crazy but the HPA website said that public and international affairs are one of the most successful pre-med majors at Princeton and I love policy but am also super interested in medicine and don’t know what route I’ll ultimately choose (law/public sector or medicine). However, I know I have to start working on pre-reqs and was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to accomplish this successfully or just in gen? Also, if I’m invited to FSI and do it, what would make the best secondary course? 


ThanksThank you so much! Your response makes me feel much better about possibly pursuing that :)Hi there! While I am a pre-med and politics or anthro major, SPIA isn’t that far off and I considered SPIA for a time so I know what goes into it somewhat.

First off, I did FSI and definitely recommend it if you get invited. It’s a great way to get some courses under your belt (with easier grading imo) that can give you some wiggle room later on if you need to drop a course to take a lighter load. I took the SOC/POL one and it was fine, nothing to write home about. They’re pretty good about placing you in the one that matches your interests I think.

As far as doing pre-med and SPIA, imo it really isn’t as difficult as some people may have you believe. SPIA pre-recs are only 4 classes, and those classes are either super flexible or are large classes that many students take, so provided you take 1 each semester in freshman and sophomore year, you’d be plenty set to major in it.

The same thinking goes for pre-med. Depending on how you choose to plan your schedule, you’ll be taking 1-2 pre-med classes each semester. The only real downside to doing pre-med and SPIA together (along with any non-natural science major really) is that your choice of electives and taking weird and strange courses is going to be a little thin, because each semester will have you taking 3-4 classes (likely 4 in freshman and sophomore year especially) to meet either major requirements, pre-med classes, or distribution requirements. If you’re fine with that, it’s plenty doable to do those two things while here. If you’re not fine with that, you can always go up to 5 classes in a semester and diversify your semesters a bit more at the cost of more work. It’s really up to you what you feel you can handle.

Hopefully that helps! If you have any other questions feel free to ask!Thank you so much! Your response makes me feel much better about possibly pursuing that :)Aerospace Engineering at PrincetonI’m a recent admit at Princeton and I plan on studying aerospace engineering. I have not committed yet, and that’s cause I’m stuck between UCLA and Princeton.

AFAIK, UCLA’s aerospace program is slightly better and organized with much stronger clubs, but I don’t really know too much about Princeton.

In terms of strictly AE, what school should I can choose? Also, what should I know about AE at Princeton?

Thanks!Wait, seriously? Even engineering graduates end up in finance or consulting? WTF? That's somewhat shattered my dreams of going there and studying aerospace engineering...Certainly not all of them, I won’t cite old numbers from ten years ago but fewer than half of engineering grads at that time stayed in engineering for jobs/grad school. 

The finance/consulting pull is so strong at Princeton :-/Almost all of the computer science graduates my year ended up on wall Street, despite very aggressive recruiting in the middle of the late 90s dot com boom.Just curious, why would you allow one comment (let alone one from a basically anonymous source who by their own admission isn’t even a current student) shatter your dream? Seems a rather spurious basis for such a decision.So employers would be attracted to someone with an engineering degree from Princeton, people just choose to go into finance/consulting?LMAO. good point.Yeah for sure, Princeton is still great for name recognition for any job, my first comment is just arguing that in applied fields like engineering, domain specific experience > ivy leave name recognitionAlright ty.https://mae.princeton.edu/undergraduate

I’ll say you are definitely not wrong to be considering UCLA if you already know you want to do a specific degree that is stronger there. Especially in a hard engineering field, name recognition (within top tier schools like Princeton and UCLA) is not the most important thing; the aerospace industry cares more about demonstrated experience like project teams and internships. (Also the hyper obsession among new admits with school rankings is not shared with the entire professional industry!) If I were you I would consider cost and also learn about the engineering clubs and project teams at each university, particularly in applications you are interested in working on for a job later. If you want to stay in academia perhaps the Princeton name will serve you well, though. 

Also a lot of Princeton graduates (including engineering graduates) end up in finance and consulting which is disappointing. I think the program has improved since I studied there though and Princeton engineering is expanding with ongoing construction…https://facilities.princeton.edu/projects/es-seas

Good luck with whichever you choose!Princeton’s MAE is very good. I’m currently a PhD student here and have TA’d several undergrad class and can confirm it’s very good. I went to undergrad at Stanford for mechanical and the education here is equally as good. For reference I did a lot of research in undergrad and worked with PhD students at Stanford who did their undergrad at Princeton and they are the best of the bestPrinceton. Peers matter more esp at undergraduate level.If you’re undecided between UCLA and Princeton, please go to UCLA and let someone else take your Princeton spot.Depends what you want, if you want more intimate time with professors and generally a tighter knit atmosphere - princeton, if you don't really care about those things then UCLA might be the choice for you. And also to add, people say often that princeton engineering isn't very big on research which is generally a myth, they have the facilities and do encourage independent research, they have a whole senior thesis which would be straight research on whatever you want.   
I would also recommend interacting with admits at both schools and if you can, visit, because determining whether you like the vibe of a school is going to be a major factor of your happiness there moving forward.

This is coming from a pre-frosh commit at Pton who is intent on majoring aerospace and who also got a pretty in-depth look at MAE at Pton.

Good luck in whatever decision you make!What school u commit to?Go to UCLA. If you want to be an engineer, they don't care about the brand name of the school as much (plus, UCLA is equally as prestigious)Certainly not all of them, I won’t cite old numbers from ten years ago but fewer than half of engineering grads at that time stayed in engineering for jobs/grad school.

Hi, we are two CS students looking for people who are interested in starting a quantitative hedge fund with us. Please PM us if you have a quantitative/ technical/ STEM background and are interested. We have previously worked with quants from D.E. Shaw, Saudi Aramco, DC Energy.

Feel free to reach out for more information, and/or indepth conversations about quantitative finance :)How are premeds doing at Princeton?Currently deciding whether or not to commit as a molecular biology major (have some other options like Brown and Penn’s dual degree life sciences/management program) so any advice would help a lot.

Obvious ikr there will be bias, but please try and remain honest about things like grade deflation, lack of a hospital nearby, etc. The Preview people were obviously not going to tell us it’s tough and stuff so I would like the truth. I’m an international (Canadian) who’s hoping to practice in the US and don’t want my premed dreams crushed lol.I didn’t actually get into PLME! But I was accepted to Penn’s dual degree program in Biology and Management @ Wharton.as a formerly premed student as pton, i would say go for PLME (i was gonna apply to that haha) because it offers you a lot more opportunities. my premed friends at princeton struggle with finding medical internship/volunteer work opportunities and even penn is much better for that bc of the nearby hospitals. as much as i love princeton (sometimes lol) it is not a good place for premed. also our chem classes are not premed oriented at all and will kick u in the ass if ur not very chemistry-oriented. finally, if you enjoy studying things besides math/science, and are even thinking about a non bio/chem major, don’t come to princeton. if ur premed at pton u basically have to be a chem or bio major or risk taking 5 classes every semester and having little work/school life balance. princeton obviously has a great name but doesn’t compare to dual programs or PLME if you know you want to go into medicine.There were more princeton grads in my med school class (T5) than any other school for what that’s worth. Princeton like every other school wants their graduates to succeed. You won’t be hurting your chances at med school by going to Princeton.I went on a Princeton tour yesterday (as an admitted student, still deciding between schools) and my tour guide was a pre-med senior majoring in Chemistry. He was very enthusiastic about Princeton—while he did say the academics were challenging, he really loved the atmosphere and was very fulfilled by his experience. 

Also, graduate schools account for Princeton's rigorous academics. For example, Harvard Law's GPA median for accepted students is 3.94 while for the average Princeton admit it's a 3.78. I think it should be the same for med schools.no…? have some friends therehttps://ripplematch.com/journal/article/the-average-gpa-of-every-ivy-league-university-64f7f55d/

If not deflation it’s at least not inflated at allPenn is also known for grade deflation.Do you mind if I Pm you?Sure!I’m premed at Princeton. It’s true that classes are hard (but that’s true at any top institution) and the lack of med schools nearby makes it difficult to find clinical volunteering opportunities but it’s not impossible. There’s the Princeton Medical Center, EMT squad, hospice volunteering and more that students can be a part of. 

However I find that the close relationship you have with your thesis advisor and the (very) hands-on advising that HPA, the health professions advising office, gives is more than enough to make up for this. Ultimately, it comes down to whether you like the campus vibe at these schools better than another. Any school is a great choice and there are pros and cons to everything.

Edit: also you don’t have to commit to a particular major now. It’s very easy to switch majors in the first 2 years of your Princeton career, so you are not locked in to molecular biology at all.Damn, do you think I should go to Penn or Brown instead?I've only interacted with residents from Brown and they seem pretty happy with their lifestyle in the hospital. I don't think you can go wrong with either choice in terms of clinical experience as they both have great hospitals nearby. In terms of academic experience, however, I think there is potentially a large gap between Princeton vs Penn/Brown. My experience at Princeton has been largely "intellectual" in the sense that academic pursuits for the sake of exploration or deeper understanding is encouraged. I also found this same sort of mentality at my PhD program (hardcore STEM university) and really flourished there. Medical school was the exact opposite; you are so overwhelmed with facts and information that your only available move is to absorb and regurgitate. In other words, it was the antithesis of a strong Ivy League education, and since I was essentially brought up educationally in the former manner, my biggest struggle was seeing my time wasted memorizing content. I'm not sure how the education of Penn/Brown compares to Princeton, but I would assume you'll still get a good experience there, albeit one that will still be in stark contrast to the mindless grind of medical school.Do you feel comfortable sharing which university you’re currently doing your MD/PhD at? If not I  completely understand, I’m just trying to gauge where some of the premeds at Pton end up going for MD/PhD (I’m kinda in the same
boat as you: really passionate about research and discovering new things, the clinical aspect is interesting as well)DM'd you.Former pre-med at Princeton. grinded through chem major under intent to enter med school. Didn't get much clinical exposure, because Princeton. Now I'm almost done w/ med school and looking at non-clinical jobs because I realized that I hate the hospital lifestyle. In hindsight, having that clinical exposure during undergrad would've definitely helped w/ narrowing down career options during undergrad. I guess I was just following what my friends did; we were all good at science and had aspirations to go into medicine. I'm on the MD/PhD track, way more passionate about research, so at least I have an out.Current premed. While there are opportunities to shadow and volunteer at places around here, they’re often hard to get into/confusing/not promoted properly. I’ve really had to make an effort. That being said, I’m a current soph so a lot of my difficulty at first could have just been Covid making medicine difficultI didn’t actually get into PLME!

“A true Renaissance woman, Princeton’s valedictorian has proved herself an extraordinary scholar and research scientist, and has also starred in stage plays and written stories and poetry, all while earning 10 A+’s in courses from six different departments, including English and psychology as well as molecular biology (her concentration) and quantitative and computational biology (her certificate program). At Princeton, A+ grades require written justifications from the professors. Over the course of her four years, Orlovsky earned no grade below an A.”


https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/04/25/natalia-orlovsky-named-princeton-valedictorian-frances-mangina-selectedOh, she was in three of my classes this year. Clearly very intelligent person, and very friendly and humble as well.You were almost salutatorian!I wasn’t even aware you COULD get an A+. I get one A and about 3 Cs a semester.Add two more A+‘s for humility and kindness! What a joy and privilege to have a friend like this.Natalia is one of the sweetest people I know of, and honestly through all my interactions with her over the past ~2 years I've known her I still didn't know everything about how amazing she is! I'm glad she is given a spotlight for everything she has achieved :)She is super impressive.  All those A+ grades are      mind-blowing.That’s insaneWorth what?Not worth the costs such as over emphasizing grades, possibly discouraging taking challenging courses or those you normally wouldn’t have taken etc

Edit: not sure why all the downvotes, this isn’t an incredibly controversial opinion. For example Stanford doesn’t have Valedictorian/Salutatorian or merit based scholarships or any big awards that puts anyone above others. All students are already incredible at these top schools, there’s no point singling out ‘incredible’ individuals, and even then I don’t think grades are the right metric in this case anywaysI tend to agree with you that having these categories doesn’t really add anything particularly positive or helpful to the community. I guess I just don’t really see it making anything much worse either. It strikes me as pointless at worst. I admit, though, it was sort of cool to hear about her and I probably wouldn’t have had there been no valedictorian. And I suspect she would have had no less impressive a career at Princeton without that distinction being there to achieve. Doubt very much she strove like that in order to become valedictorian.In terms of grades, I can definitely point out Anthony Hein '22 has at least 17 A+'s (just look him up, he has his transcript on his website), so it's not just a grades thing. Natalia is an amazing well-rounded individual and got her valedictorian nomination for that, and I can agree to disagree with you on this but I think it's great that her accomplishments are celebrated!I agree with you. There’s “no point” to a lot of things. It doesn’t mean we have to stop doing them. But this does have a point. It’s an earned distinction. Why shouldn’t she be rewarded for her stellar achievements?  I don’t think it discouraged people from taking difficult classes. They aren’t going to hand the title to people that do that.[deleted]👏They should get rid of valedictorian/salutatorian imo, putting people on pedestals (as great as they are) isn’t worth itYou were almost salutatorian!Add two more A+‘s for humility and kindness!

I don't know if this is the appropriate place to post this but I have been lucky enough to have been offered a place at Princeton and Oxford for Computer Science. I was wondering if any Computer Scientists / Mathematicians could give me some insight into what a regular day at Princeton looks like for them and how it might differ to Oxford. Thanks!This, 100% lol. I also think the college vs uni life is really differentI'd think it's more about whether you want to live in the US or the UK for several years.It’s a small thing, but no student takes five classes *every* semester, even if they’re engineers. 4/8 semesters have to be five classes if I’m not mistaken for BSE students, which can be even less if one participated in summer classes.... I took four semesters of 5, three semesters of 6, and one semester of 7.  Whatchoo talking 'bout?Good point, I guess you don’t have to take five every semester (I just opted to). Either way, still more than you’d have at Oxford.Your experience is fairly atypical, I’m sure you know that. No need to take my statements so literallyIt really wasn't.  Many of my friends were doing all 5's and 6's.  People wanted to get the most out of their time there.And many of my friends are doing 4 or 5 classes, so 🤷‍♂️

In fact I don’t even think they let you sign up for more than 6 now, so I have to wonder when you were here.

I only know of a single person ever doing 6 classes, and everyone I know agrees she’s unique in that regard.Hi, congrats! I studied ORFE at Princeton (Class of 2018) and went on to do an MSc in CS at Oxford (+ I spent my junior spring semester at Oxford).

The big thing I’d say is that undergraduate life at Princeton is very structured compared to undergraduate life at Oxford. At Princeton you’ll have multiple classes a day, some of which will be large lectures. At Oxford, you’ll have a handful of classes a week and they will be very small in size (like, usually 2-3 people with an instructor). At Princeton, you’ll constantly be getting graded with homework, midterms, etc whereas at Oxford the only evaluations that really matter will happen at the end of the year (not counting end of term collections). At Princeton, you’ll take five classes every semester, and they’ll include not only classes relevant to your major, but also distribution requirements. You’ll also (probably) be expected to do a senior thesis. At Oxford, you’ll take two classes most trimesters and they’ll all be directly related to your topic of study.

Basically, Oxford will give you lots of work but lots of freedom in how you handle it, and will be single-minded in your topic of study. Princeton will give you lots of work, but its structure will force you to spread out your learning in terms of time and also discipline via distribution requirements. Both CS programs can be quite theoretical, but I found Princeton to have more practical coding assignments than Oxford.

Oxford’s college life is much better than Princeton’s residential college system imo, and Oxford as a city is much livelier than Princeton (and well connected to London). On the other hand, Princeton is a secluded place to study and take in every aspect of college life, while still having great access to NYC. Also, most people enjoy eating clubs, which compensate for Oxford’s colleges a bit.

Idk what your financial situation is, but unless A) you’re paying full price no matter what or B) you got really, really lucky and got a scholarship at Oxford, Princeton will probably be way cheaper. If you are paying full price, this probably flips though, as Oxford’s only three years and college costs in the UK are a little lower.

I’m kind of rambling, but having spent a lot of time at both of these (great!) institutions, I have lots of thoughts. I don’t think you can go wrong either way though. Happy to answer any specific questions you have in this thread or via PM.

Also, as a side note, there are lots of exchange programs between the two schools, so whichever one you pick you’ll probably be able to check the other out during your undergrad!Ewww England. It’s so grey there lmaoI'd say Princeton, on the basis of pure prestige they're similar, but Princeton is definitely stronger for STEM, particularly CS. Plus, I personally prefer the US education system with minors (certificates at Princeton) and the liberal arts curriculum allowing flexibility to explore other disciplines. I'm CO2026 too and will possibly be doing CS, hope to see you on campus! 

Also, I feel oxford is just way too small in terms of sheer size for a good experience (the fact there are so many colleges means there will be only around 3-4 other ppl from your course staying with you, just something to consider)This, 100% lol. I also think the college vs uni life is really different... I took four semesters of 5, three semesters of 6, and one semester of 7.  Whatchoo talking 'bout?Good point, I guess you don’t have to take five every semester (I just opted to).

I only know of a single person ever doing 6 classes, and everyone I know agrees she’s unique in that regard.It’s a small thing, but no student takes five classes *every* semester, even if they’re engineers. 4/8 semesters have to be five classes if I’m not mistaken for BSE students, which can be even less if one participated in summer classes.Your experience is fairly atypical, I’m sure you know that.

I made this new app, called FuzeMee, that allows students to buy and sell items to other students on campus in a safe and easy way. So, if you're looking to get rid of stuff before the end of the school year (furniture, clothing, books, etc), you can list it on the marketplace. **We will match anything you make up to $100 for these last two weeks of school!!** This is the app: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fuzemee/id1532369140](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fuzemee/id1532369140)Getting RescindedI was recently accepted to the class of 2026. My predicted grades were 99.4/100 (unweighted, I'm from India so we have only 5 subjects and our final transcript consists of our end of year exam marks). 

What is the absolute lowest I could go without getting rescinded? People say within 5% but 95 seems tough for me now, I think I can get 90-93 comfortably. 

Do any of you know of people getting rescinded? Or better yet, doing very badly and then still keeping their admission?i think typically unless u have a drastic grade change (like an a to a c) ur acceptance won’t get rescinded. ik ppl who flopped their tests but were still fine>I think I can get 90-93 comfortably. 

you'll be perfectly fine with thatNo one ever gets rescinded.Thank you sm for this!!!Bro chill. I am from India. My IB grades dropped from 44 predicted to 39 which is as good as a A+ overall average to a B+ overall. It's all good. These schools will not rescind you. I go to an ivy too (not Princeton). They genuinely dont give a fuck about ur grades. If that is ICSE OR CBSE, you can score upto a 80-85%, and i bet u'd be fine. But try to not lag tooo behind. Also, Congratulations!!!Thank you sm for this!!!Princeton or Brown for pre-med?I also want to actually have some fun in college too.But also, you may find a new passion in college and change majors or want to stay with biological related fields but not be a doctor! Or maybe you just love Princeton. In which case … definitely Princeton 🐅Pre med at Princeton is hard — took out a couple of my friends. I can’t speak to Brown, but it’s one of the few Princeton tracks that makes me 😬😬Brown is easy af so probably there for GPA bumpPrinceton grad student here, who also got into an M.D/Ph.D program in the past. The only two things that **really** matter for med school admissions (right now) are GPA and MCAT. Average GPAs at Brown historically tend to be higher than at Princeton.Do you have a link for more info on that Penn program?Yeah for sure, it’s a program specifically for URM (Black and Latinx) tho.That sounds awesome for those students, but my profile is definitely over represented in medicine 😅No worries, do you have a school you’re leaning towards?I’m deciding between these as well. Brown is def  easier with GPA, but I found Pton had some pretty cool programs with Penn Medicine (one of them is an undergrad research internship program that, if selected as an undergrad, allows you to matriculate to Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine and get your MD upon graduation). If you’re really motivated, premed at Pton should be manageable, and in my opinion, while both are amazing schools, Princeton is a whole other tier.brown(WL brown and into pton) - i chose ptonPrinceton is great, and if you like the vibe and opportunities you should come, but I think it’s a tough place to be pre-med. (I’m not, but as a bio major I take the same classes they have to and know a lot of them.)

Ask around and find out what Brown’s orgo and other hard pre-med courses are like - Brown’s pass/fail options will help your GPA, but you can’t do that with orgo etc. Outside of chem and math I don’t find Princeton’s grading that tough, so it really just comes down to those subjects.But also, you may find a new passion in college and change majors or want to stay with biological related fields but not be a doctor!

The AP exam is in a few weeks. As I read this statement from Princeton, there appears to be no reason to take this exam, as credit isn’t available for it, regardless of score.

Thank you.based on the page you linked, it seems that a 5 in statistics replaces ECON 202That’s very helpful! Thank you!Check the prereqs for departments you’re interested in - some of them allow you to get out of things with AP scores even if it isn’t on the main AP table page (it’ll be on their websites)Princeton can’t rescind you if you don’t send the scores.

First off, I just want to say that I'm incredibly lucky to have gotten into both schools and to be in this position. But right now, I'm having the hardest time deciding between the two schools. I'm thinking about going pre-med and pursuing a degree in the STEM field. Princeton's better for the program that I'm looking into, but I'm really worried about the grade deflation here. On the other hand, Penn has one of the best pre-med programs in the country. What do you guys think?lol I was making the same decision until like a week ago. chose Princeton in the end, I think u j have to go with a gut feeling at this point bc they're both great. I would directly contact students doing ur program to ask about their experience tho - that's what ultimately helped me choose[deleted][deleted]Congrats on your acceptances!

Princeton ended grade deflation in 2014.

If you're interested in PhD programs, Princeton has a lot more graduates attending most elite PhD programs, although it's hard to say to what extent this has to do with self-selection. Princeton's faculty in most departments are rated higher, and this could help if you take advantage of undergraduate research opportunities, which Princeton students are required to do.

Normalized for size, Princeton has more graduates attending top medical schools, although this also has to do with self selection. Penn probably has more in absolute numbers because Penn has nearly twice as many undergrads (2400 vs 1300 per class).

Medical school prestige doesn't really matter, at least not nearly as much as law school/MBA/PhD prestige in terms of career opportunities.

I'm a Princeton grad doing my PhD at MIT.Princeton, no doubt..I was in a similar position (WL at Penn but into Princeton) and ended up choosing Princeton. For me, it pretty much came down to prestige and a specific program that Princeton offeredIf this is a hard choice for you there must be things about both that you really love. It’s so subjective. For me, this is just about the easiest choice I could imagine, because all of my interactions with Penn have been lousy and all my interactions with Princeton have been great so far. I also wouldn’t want to live in Philadelphia (been there done that), and I think Princeton is lovely. So you see it’s very subjective. If you are going just on reputation and prestige, Princeton wins by quite a ways, and that’s saying something because Penn is obviously quite well regarded by everyone who will matter. If you’re going by size, it depends what you like. If you’re going by undergraduate vs graduate student focus, Princeton is much more the former than Penn. Nobody can decide this for you. Only you know what you like. Princeton and Penn are different enough that the choice should become clear to you pretty quickly. It’s a good problem to have.Princeton grades deflation is tough comparing to other top colleges. Health professional  (HPA) at Princeton is the best in helping you preparing your premed track.[deleted][deleted][deleted]Botany class?Is there a basic botany class at Princeton, perhaps with a field component? I’ve looked around the course catalog a bit and can’t find any, which surprised me.Not really - EEB has some classes that touch on it (like ecology, or the field programs in Panama/Kenya), but the curriculum tends to focus on general ecological concepts more than specific botany knowledge.Anyone experienced with the urban planning program? Is it easy to be involved in areas way outside your major?Currently looking into majoring in urban planning, I've also got some strong interests in game design and music composition. Is princeton a good place to learn urban planning while also upholding my other interests? I only have really cursory CS knowledge... is Princeton conducive to learning other things way outside your major? (For example taking classes to further my trombone playing and composition skills and learning about game design while also being an urban planning major?)

I visited Princeton over spring break and absolutely loved it!

Excuse me if this is a stupid question. Very new to researching universities!Princeton does, however, have solid composition classes.Princeton doesn’t have an urban planning major, nor any game design classes. Princeton has a liberal arts and engineering focus, which means it’s classes focus on the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. It does not have pre-professional majors or classes. It would be worthwhile to look up what majors you would be interested in at the colleges you like.

The closest to that that Princeton has is the Architecture major alongside the Urban Studies certificate.Princeton does, however, have solid composition classes.Seeking Stool Donor for medical procedureMid-30s NJ resident here, posting in this sub because college-age donors are ideal for this procedure. Apologies if this post breaks any sub rules. 

I've been dealing with a pretty intense functional GI disorder and after a whole lot of testing and 10+ different medications that didn't help I've exhausted the treatment options that doctors can currently provide. Among the various homeopathic remedies that can be found through naturopaths and the internet is a pretty radical treatment called [FMT or Fecal Microbiota Transplant]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant) which, with stool from a high-quality donor, can be performed by the patient at home. [This webcomic explains it pretty well, believe it or not]( http://threewordphrase.com/donor.htm).

It's gross, but not as gross as being sick for the rest of my life would be, so I'm trying to have a sense of humor about it. This procedure is approved, and is highly effective for treatment of C. Difficile infection, but so far it has not been approved for any other indication despite promising research so my doctor unfortunately can't be involved.

The donor criteria is extremely strict and unfortunately none of my friends or family qualify, so I figured I would see if a kind stranger from the internet might help me with this weird, awkward thing that could improve my life one million percent.

If you or someone you know meet the following base criteria and would be willing to explore being a donor, please reach out to me via PM here or e-mail fmtftact@gmail.com
	

Male

Age 15-30

Lean body type

Essentially perfect physical and mental health

No allergies or food sensitivities

Varied diet

There are some more involved questions that would need to be answered, and a potential donor would have to be screened for pathogens, but after that all they would need to do is come to a convenient location and make a deposit, so to speak. I am local to North Jersey but will happily travel to make this happen.

Thanks!This is almost always the right answer.... the one that your friends are going for?Spend some time hanging out at them, get upperclassmen friends to take you to theirs and try the food, and consider location and amenities. Then consider whether you’d want to bicker (and decide if you’re ok with whatever stereotypes there are about the club).

I have a few questions about engineering at Princeton.

What machine shops and makerspaces are available to students?

How real-world or hands on are courses?

What are median grades like in intro courses?

Is the culture more competitive or collaborative?

What is the workload like? Do people still have lives outside of school?

Do you think Princeton engineering prepares you well for a career in engineering?

Thanks! For reference, other options are uc Berkeley, Ucla, northwestern, Hopkins, Dartmouth, washu, and Umich.I'm MAE. The culture is definitely more collaborative within MAE courses (not sure about the others).

The workload is pretty tough for some of the intro MAE courses and first year courses. I strongly suggest taking the engineering math/physics requirements and not PHY 103/104 and MAT 201/202. Most people take the PHY and MAT ones since they fulfill the same requirements as the engineering ones, but they're poorly taught IMO and they focus too much on theory (which engineers don't care about).>There's a solid MAE shop (shout-out to Glenn and Al!) and good shop for the general engineering school. Physics also has a shop but I've never used it. There's a few makerspaces too. You'll have plenty of opportunities to get your hands dirty out of class.  
>  
>Some of the courses that are very hands on too, either in the shop or in some other lab. Junior design in shop-based and a cornerstone of the program.  
>  
>Grades are tough but don't come here if you want straight As. Come to Princeton if you want to be really challenged.  
>  
>Some people are collaborative, some people suck. Overall I never felt like it was cutthroat. We're all in the wringer together.  
>  
>Workload is intense. See my point about Princeton being the place for people who want the greatest challenge. But you can have a life. Just don't expect to have a life AND have good grades AND sleep enough. Something will always have to give (which thing that is varies week to week).  
>  
>As to the real-world applicability of courses and career preparedness, know this: Princeton does not focus the program to training engineers at all. The focus is training engineering professors. A huge percentage go straight to ph.ds. There are tons of opportunities for research, fewer for co-ops. Most professors spend their entire career in academia, not industry. I'm in the minority of my class as someone who actually works in the mechanical engineering industry.  
>  
>That said, I wouldn't have my current job if it wasn't for the research I did with a big name prof. My current boss recognized the name and was impressed, although I am in R&D. Manufacturing engineering roles will care much less about research, but then again basically no colleges teach manufacturing engineering anyways.  
>  
>l have a better understanding of the fundamental physics behind engineering than my coworkers from most other schools. But if you want to walk the industry path (don't decide now--you still have years ahead of you) you'll want to put in the effort to get industry internships and such and not just be a post-doc in training in someone's lab.  
>  
>Overall, it's an amazing school. The opportunities are there if you go for them, but understand that the focus is academia, not industry.

Thank you! This is super helpful and saved me a potential waste of four years!Despite the fact that MAE isn't as hands-on, there are tons of opportunities to make it more hands-on. They have engineering clubs that routinely use the machine shop and you can make pretty much anything you want because of Princeton's huge budget. The MAE courses are very small and I've had relationships with many of the professors because the courses have been so small (which I don't think I would've had if the courses had been larger). All of the MAE professors want you to succeed and really don't want you to fail their courses or struggle. Also when you're a junior, you can work in independent work and pretty much do anything while being mentored by a professor (which is super cool!!!!). This means by the time you graduate, you'll have two projects + two professors you worked closely with (which make great letter of recommendations)[deleted]I didn't mean it that way, I just really prioritize hands-on building and practical experience and don't want to go into academia. It is a great school, just probably not for me. Prestige isn't really a factor because I have other options so it doesn't seem to make since for me.[deleted]Huge machine shop with plenty of both manual and CNC machines. I was a computer science major but still managed to spend basically a full year getting aluminum shavings and cooling fluid in my hair because I made friends and wrote a backend to let Pro/E drive one of the CNC milling machines (it was sitting idle because it was donated and incompatible with any software we had).

Thank you! This is super helpful and saved me a potential waste of four years!Despite the fact that MAE isn't as hands-on, there are tons of opportunities to make it more hands-on. They have engineering clubs that routinely use the machine shop and you can make pretty much anything you want because of Princeton's huge budget. The MAE courses are very small and I've had relationships with many of the professors because the courses have been so small (which I don't think I would've had if the courses had been larger). All of the MAE professors want you to succeed and really don't want you to fail their courses or struggle. Also when you're a junior, you can work in independent work and pretty much do anything while being mentored by a professor (which is super cool!!!!). This means by the time you graduate, you'll have two projects + two professors you worked closely with (which make great letter of recommendations)I didn't mean it that way, I just really prioritize hands-on building and practical experience and don't want to go into academia. It is a great school, just probably not for me. Prestige isn't really a factor because I have other options so it doesn't seem to make since for me.[deleted]I didn't mean it that way, I just really prioritize hands-on building and practical experience and don't want to go into academia.

Just wondering if anyone knows what textbook MAT 215 uses, as I'm trying to preview some of the content to see if it's a good fit for me in the fall! Trying to decide to do 215 or 216! Any help is appreciated!Thank you!According to princetoncourses.com, it uses understanding analysis by stephen abbott, which is the same book my roommate is currently using. I think i remember him mentioning a good preview of the class can be achieved after completing the third pset?Rudin's book is great for the intended target audience, which is those who already have experience with proofs.  The math department  suggests other paths for those interested in math who are not coming in with an especially strong background. 

Princeton has a fantastic math department for those who want to study the subject. Would you advise people not major in physics too?

I mean yeah, probably, but depends on what your goals are / what you value in life. Math and physics majors have surprisingly little utility in the corporate world - physics probably has more due to applications in the defense industry / hard sciences - but if you're passionate enough to pursue a PhD or enter academia, then the majors are great.

From my perspective, I was under-prepared for MAT 215. Despite having the usual 5 in AP Calc BC / Statistics, I had almost no exposure to proof-based courses, and didn't last long in the major.

|-|-|-|-|Financial Service User Survey - DiversaTech @ UC BerkeleyHello everyone!

As part of a consulting project, my team is currently collecting data by surveying and interviewing dozens of college students across the country in order to better understand student preference, sentiment, and behavior towards innovation in financial services (e.g. app-based brokerages, digital banking, etc). In an effort to further a student initiative, I kindly ask for your collaboration by filling out this quick 3 minute [survey](https://forms.gle/uyvv2bt9V4qaBhdh9)! Also, please indicate that Marden referred you to this survey.

Thanks!

[Survey Link](https://forms.gle/uyvv2bt9V4qaBhdh9)Is it possible to create your own certificate?I’ve been accepted to Princeton and Penn’s Life Sciences and Management dual degree program, and I really don’t want to lose out on that healthcare management aspect if I end up choosing Princeton. I currently can’t find any certificate program in healthcare management; is it possible to create one unique to my goals? I know at some schools you can create your own concentrations and such so that’s what I asked.Do they have classes in healthcare management at Princeton? I personally believe that minors (basically what certificates are), are useless because at the end of the day they’re just more courses requirements. You should just take the courses you want to take. If getting a minor requires you to take course A, B, C, and D, but you don’t want to take course D, just don’t take course D.. the only thing you miss out on is not having the minor on your diploma, but you can still list coursework on your resume and you’ll also have all the knowledge. Basically, find out if Princeton offers the courses you want to take related to healthcare management and don’t worry about the  formality of getting a certificate."Independent Study" is a major you can choose, and it can be whatever you can convince people to accept. Neuroscience was often an "independent study" major before it became a formal major. I've seen people major in environmental studies before too.I do think there’s a way to create your own major / certificate at Princeton but TheChimeras is spot on to point out that the content itself of healthcare mgmt isn’t available at Princeton so you wouldn’t be able to “create” that certificate by stringing together courses.

If you’re really torn, you can DM me. I went to Princeton and my wife studied healthcare mgmt at Penn.No. But I wouldn’t not go to Princeton because of a management undergrad. You can always pick up a one year health management degree afterwards.no. princeton has no med school. if u want to go to med school don't come herePrinceton has some courses in health policy and some courses in business-adjacent things that are vaguely management-like, but not many offerings in healthcare management that I’m aware of (since we don’t have a business or med school). Look at registrar.Princeton.edu/course-offerings and see if there are enough relevant courses in the first place"Independent Study" is a major you can choose, and it can be whatever you can convince people to accept. Neuroscience was often an "independent study" major before it became a formal major. I've seen people major in environmental studies before too.What's the cheapest way to travel from Princeton to Washington, DC and back?Trenton is the closest metropolitan area to Princeton, but bus/train tickets from DC to Trenton look really expensive (> $100 one way). 

The two other options I'm considering are taking a bus from DC to either Philly/NYC and taking the NJ Transit train from the train station to Princeton Junction (\~$60 one way), but this seems sub-optimal.

Anyone have recommendations for more efficient / cheaper ways to commute between DC and Princeton?Gonna be hard to beat Amtrak for convenience- <3hr for reasonable price from princeton junction to DC Union. Just make sure to book >2 weeks outi did this pre-covid. highly recommend. it's not like amtrak level quality but it's cheap, you're getting what you're paying forIf you need to go cheap, OurBus has a direct DC Union Station to Hamilton route. I've booked it for $24 each way if you book out far enough. It's a long bus ride. Don't expect the wifi to work.

&#x200B;

[https://www.ourbus.com/routes/dc-to-hamilton](https://www.ourbus.com/routes/dc-to-hamilton)

&#x200B;

But like others said, Amtrak from Princeton Junction is by far the most convenient, and gets cheaper if you can book > 3 weeks out. Watch out for sales, and sticking to travel on weekdays helps too, and you can find tickets for as low as \~$50-60NJ transit to Trenton, Septa to Philly, and Megabus to DC is probably the cheapest and doesn't involve going the wrong way. It definitely is annoying and a lot can go wrong, but the transfer in Philly doesn't require much walking since the bus leaves from near 30th Street station.Like the other commenter said, Amtrak but book a few weeks outAmtrak booked in advanceWait that’s actually really affordable split among 3+ students damnRide share with another studentThe cheapest is probably NJtransit to NYC and then a megabus to DC. Give yourself time to walk between Penn Station and the bus pickup spot in Hudson Yardsi did this pre-covid. highly recommend. it's not like amtrak level quality but it's cheap, you're getting what you're paying forWait that’s actually really affordable split among 3+ students damnis it possible to do research in the summer before freshman year?I plan to major in molecular biology at Princeton in the fall and am currently interested in doing some research over the summer. Do you think it would be possible to get in contact with faculty and see if there are any opportunities available over the summer? I only live about 15 minutes away from campus.Even aside from that, figuring out how to deal with a college courseload alongside research is hard! I’d never advise anybody to get into research until they’ve spent at least a semester figuring out their workload, if not moreyou would have to email the professors to ask but I don’t see why not. I would recommend spending this summer just chilling/hanging out with friends though so you don’t feel burnt out before school even starts!Even aside from that, figuring out how to deal with a college courseload alongside research is hard! I’d never advise anybody to get into research until they’ve spent at least a semester figuring out their workload, if not morePrinceton vs. Cornell EngineeringHi! I recently was accepted into the engineering programs at Cornell and Princeton. I'm not sure what type of engineering I'm most interested in yet. I understand that Princeton has a very strong undergraduate program and Cornell's engineering program is extremely good. Any takes on the choice ahead of me?Visit both schools and see which student culture you could see yourself in.  Both are great engineering schools.  It is a personal choice at this point.Both will teach you what you need to know and get you jobs/positions. Imo you should decide based on the big differences between the schools outside engineering (size, location, social scene, academic setup, etc.)How is princeton in crowded new jersey?Peer or near-peer quality. The main difference is campus feel. Cornell has 26k students, Princeton 9k. Cornell dominates its relatively rural region, Princeton is in crowded NJ midway between Philly and NYC. Visit both campuses and see what feels right.  
.How is princeton in crowded new jersey?Any discord groups of Princeton students(computer science/math/physics/filming)?Can you dm me.There’s a main one for class of 2026. If you’re interested, PM me!Can you dm me.Is it possible to complete a bs in comp sci and then do a masters in stats in 5 yrs?Or does the bs/ms program require that both degrees be in the same major? Thanks!Do you happen to know which “certain engineering departments” are?If I remember correctly the only engineering departments who did _not_ continue their MEng programs were COS and ORF(?).

I am interested in applying for Princeton 2022-2023 cycle. For international applicants, did you submit all of your high school internal grades + actual igcse, a level grades or just the actual grades for igcse and a level is sufficient? I understand that showing that you take variety of courses is important and I believe this can be seen in your igcse grades. Students here typically complete their igcse and a levels at different schools and we don't really have the grades formatted into a transcript, but rather grades in separated reports.Thanks for your reply!Not sure if this helps, but my school submitted both the IGCSE grades and the internal grades on the same transcript, as well as my IB predicted gradesAlright, understood. Thanks for your reply and all the best in your studies.I'm from the UK, so I submitted my GCSEs and my A levels predicted grades (which were basically the same as my summer end of year 12 exams). Then I submitted my A level mock grades for midterm grades. Honestly, I don't think they're that fussed though, submit what makes you look good (for example predicted grades are likely to be a grade higher than your actual year 12 summer grades, at least in my school they are)Thanks for your reply!Alright, understood. Thanks for your reply and all the best in your studies.How long does the “holy crap I got into Princeton” high last?I’m like in a constant state of feeling thankful after such a stressful college app seasonYes!  (I think you probably still got a Hargadon letter)  Happy 25th!New beer jacket, that's cause for more excitement!My 25th reunion is coming up... I'll let you know if that feeling fades :)I will say the excitement of it being Princeton specifically wears off by the end of freshman year, if not earlier. But the experience at Princeton is pretty great (at least, it was for me!) and so that doesn't really wear off. You get used to it being great, but you will definitely miss it after graduating.Loll true but I don’t know I’ve seen people say they felt this way their entire 4 years 😂Well I guess we will see!Not long, I’d assume. Also prefrosh here, but I’m sure it completely fades once midterms roll around😂I’m ten years out, and when I interview tons of qualified applicants and few/none of them get in, I am reminded of the “holy cramp I got into Princeton” every time. Not sure it goes away ever!Princeton is always home, and with that comes it’s own highGraduated several years ago. In my experience, that feeling never goes away.I’m a freshman but sometimes I definitely still feel it lol.About speed of grey on 95Yes!
