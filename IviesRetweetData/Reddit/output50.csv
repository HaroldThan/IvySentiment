Similar to Princeton, they focus on undergraduate education, which is why they have the highest alumni donation rate and is honored year after year for their alumni network\r  \n\r  \n2. They’re consistently one of the highest awarding within the Ivy League for financial aid\r  \n\r  \n3. Their undergraduate economics and government program ranked top 5 in the nation with millions invested and committed to advance their STEM departments (I believe they recently finished construction on their multi-hundred million engineering building)\r  \n\r  \n4. Per capita, Dartmouth is third behind Wharton and Harvard in terms of sending students to top finance and consulting firms\r  \n\r  \n5. Flexible undergraduate curriculum similar to Brown\r  \n\r  \n6. Their “sophomore summer” program allows individual grades to experience Dartmouth among their cohort and is often cited as students’ favorite memory of Dartmouth\r  \n\r  \n7. They own the 2nd most land after the state government in both Vermont and New Hampshire, granted by the colonial state governments\r  \n\r  \n8. Their Greek life is often deemed progressive due to the amount of houses, including those for LGBTQ , non-binary, etc, and their generous financial aid and rules deeming that every house must be open to visitors for parties without cost or restriction\r  \n\r  \nLet me know if you all think a blurb of other Ivies would be helpful.': [], 'Congratulations, all! \n\nWelcome to the Dartmouth Family :)': [], 'Congrats everyone!': [], 'Took you people long enough!

49,dartmouth,Lead guitarist/Backing Vocalist Starting a Rock Project in the NH/MA Area *READ ENTIRE POST IF INTERESTED*,0,ug2s2t,dartmouth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/ug2s2t/lead_guitaristbacking_vocalist_starting_a_rock/,0,0.46,"Hello,

I am a 21 year old living in NH who has been playing guitar for more than 8 years at this point and am also capable of backing vocals, which I intend on doing both for this band that I am putting together. I started playing guitar being inspired by punk music, but have since expanded my taste over the years to include all kinds of rock music. I have played in bands and have experience with live shows. I go to a different school but I figured that I would reach out here figuring that there may be a lot of you from NH as well!

This will be a very intense band. I'm looking for bandmates that can make themselves available at least twice a week on weekdays. We will practice for 2 hours every practice, give or take 30 minutes depending on the speed at which we are able to accomplish our goals for that night. Every member will walk into the first practice knowing the entire repertoire I have planned by heart so that all we need to work on is developing chemistry and sense of dynamics within and between songs for that practice and all those afterwards. In terms of performing live, I seek to do this at least once a month. We will work on original material, however, I have already written the majority of the material. We will start with all covers and slowly incorporate original works as we play more live shows.

Here is what I am looking for from each individual member:

1. Drums - Loud, fast, and tight percussionist with a great sense of dynamics from each individual song down to even the most minute details of small fills. I am a huge stickler for drummers...as such I will be highly critical in terms of who I want to fulfill this role.
2. Bass/Backing Vocals - Someone who knows exactly how to fill the space, and is just as tight as the drummer is what I am looking for here. Must also be able to sing some form of backing vocals, preferably harmonies.
3. Rhythm Guitarist/Co-Lead Vocals (M or F) - You must know how to execute rhythms in a way that elevates the sense of ""bigness"" this band has as well as sing. You will not need to perform backing vocals, only taking lead vocals on certain songs that you are assigned for this set.
4. Keys/Co-Lead Vocals (M or F) - A decent keyboard player should be able to fill the space by incorporating a large variety of sounds into the mix (piano, strings, synth, etc.) from a single instrument, and be able to switch from simply making a cover more faithful to the original to making a pretty song sound prettier. Similar to the rhythm guitarist, you will not need to perform backing vocals, only taking lead vocals on certain songs that you are assigned for this set.

Here is what I am looking for from ALL members besides the previous points I mentioned earlier in the post:

1. 18 to 25 years old. Will not accept outside of that range.
2. Playing your instruments in your role of choice in this band for a MINIMUM of 4 years.
3. Must be able to bring all of their own gear. Drummers are a special case and will be figured out at some point in the future. Rhythm guitarists must possess both an electric and acoustic guitar. Singers must own at least a microphone, it is completely understandable if you don't own some sort of sound system for it (let alone want to attempt to bring it to every practice), so we will figure this out sometime later on as well.
4. Vehemence for the genre of rock and a desire to ultimately form a bond with your bandmates that will hopefully carry on even after the band dissipates.
5. Knowledge of showmanship and how to get the crowd nodding their heads to the rhythm, even if it's less than 50 people. It ain't just about bringing the noise, people say they're going to SEE a band play live, not listen to them.
6. The desire to be great, and learning what you can in order to get there.

Speaking of being a great musician, there's one more note that I want to make clear. When we practice for the first time, I want to be the worst player in the room, but I'm going to try my absolute hardest to be best. Get it? Good.

Now onto audition materials. There are five songs for this audition. They are as follows:

1. How Far We've Come - Matchbox Twenty
2. Welcome to the Jungle - Guns N' Roses
3. Dreams - Fleetwood Mac
4. Sugar, We're Goin' Down - Fall Out Boy
5. Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting) - Elton John

This is not the full set, and at this time I am unsure if all of these songs will make the final cut for the first full repertoire, however, I am sure that 3 or 4 of them will. If there are any changes, I will let you know later via DM (I will explain that shortly). All musicians must audition all of their parts for each song. Rhythm guitar does not need to take any solos, and only needs to be able to sing How Far We've Come, Dreams, and Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting). Keys only need to play on the three songs previously mentioned, and sing on the other two. Bass players do not need to audition backing vocals, simply indicate that you are capable of doing it.

If you have made it this far and decided that you want to be a part of this project, awesome! Here are your next steps:

1. DM me indicating your interest, your role of choice, your general availability over the next 3 months, and how you meet all of the criteria listed above as well as any additional information you feel like sharing about yourself. I will then provide you a time frame (and any potential changes to the audition set, if any occur) in which you are allowed to submit your audition material to me. DO NOT SEND ME YOUR AUDITION MATERIAL ALONG WITH YOUR INITIAL MESSAGE INDICATING YOUR INTEREST OR I WILL RULE YOUR SUBMISSION AS VOID.
2. After I give you a deadline to submit your audition material, you are free to submit it at any time before the deadline. You can submit it in spurts, all at the same time, etc., but it must be live footage of you playing the songs in real time to a backing track. I will judge you based upon the level of energy that you put into playing the songs as well as the accuracy to which they are played based on the original version. Obviously, you must submit the audition before the deadline is up, otherwise, you will be excluded from being a potential band member.
3. After you submit your audition, please wait for me to reach out to you. If I invite you out to coffee or lunch, it means I'm very interested in you joining the band. We will go from there.

That's all everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read through this and if any of you have questions about this post do not hesitate to ask as I will be happy to answer them. Additionally, if any bands are looking for a lead guitarist/vocalist I am willing to do it, but understand that the main reason I'm posting this is because I'm more interested in forming my own project. Also, if any of you want to talk guitar or music feel free to DM me, I'm always down for a friendly chat :)",1651420374.0,{}

52,princeton,Question about STEM and Language Placement Testing,2,v0gzxb,princeton,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/v0gzxb/question_about_stem_and_language_placement_testing/,3,1.0,"Hey ya'll! I'm an upcoming student at Princeton intending to do a BSE in MechE. In high school, I took AP Chem, but received a 2 on the exam (oof). I didn't take Physics 2,  Physics C Mechanics, or E&M (school didn't offer), but I took AP Physics 1 and received a 5 (as far as I know, this doesn't matter, but let me know if I'm wrong). I'm hoping to skip out of the chem requirement (chem 201 or 207) and maybe even the physics requirement (physics 103 and 104), and I was wondering if I'm still allowed to do the STEM placement testing for physics (since I didn't take Physics C) and for chem (since I received a 2 on the AP exam). I looked at the website and I still need some clarity since there are quite a few conditions that they mention. 

If I'm eligible to do either exam, what resources do you recommend I self-study with, and what textbooks does Princeton use for these courses?

Also, I'm eligible to do the language placement exam (took Spanish for 4 years),  and I was wondering what sources I should use to refresh. 

Thank you!",1653848180.0,"{'Congrats on being accepted! Skipping out of intro classes is a good idea. I placed out of physics through placement exam, chemistry through AP, very glad I did. Be aware that physics placement test is very difficult, much more difficult than AP physics c, which already is quite challenging. Your experience in Ap physics 1 probably won’t be comparable, to feel comfortable, try the MIT OCW physics materials. It is not easy to place out unless you are very comfortable with physics, plus, if you are MechE, you probably want a strong physics background so sticking with intro classes might not be a bad idea. \n\nFor chemistry, I used AP credit so not sure how difficult the placement exam is. Would recommend emailing the department head or the chem placement officer (find it through the website), my guess is you should feel very comfortable with the AP chen material.\n\nAnyone can take the placement tests, regardless of class background, just beware they are quite difficult.\n\nBSE kids do not need a foreign language so it is not necessary to place out of language if you are set on BSE. I tried French after taking a couple years of French and with a 4 on the AP test and basically bombed, it is quite specific on grammar and comprehension. If you somehow manage to ace it, I believe you will need to do an interview to officially place out of the 100 level Spanish classes. In other words, very difficult again.': ['Adding onto this, it’s important to note that AP Physics 1 is algebra-based physics (PHY103 and PHY104 are calculus-based), and only covers like 3/4 of PHY103 (it doesn’t include Kepler’s laws or waves, and just generally has less depth) and none of PHY104 (which is electricity and magnetism, electronics, and optics). You may be able to self-study to skip out of PHY103 (I’d recommend reading Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Tipler and Mosca if you choose to do so), but I agree with @bc_127; biting the bullet and taking them will probably serve you best in the long run. Your future Princeton classes will require a very thorough understanding PHY103/104 material.'], ""Speaking as someone who skipped a calculus class by APing out of it, I actually wish I had taken that calc class so I would have been more prepared for calc 2 at the college level.

53,princeton,Princeton FGLI Support and Recent Messages,43,uzw3qe,princeton,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/uzw3qe/princeton_fgli_support_and_recent_messages/,1,1.0,"Hello all, just wanted to make a few comments as a current FGLI student and shoot down some of u/Not-gerrymandering 's incorrect information.

Here is the original message from their previous post retyped as they deleted it:""The FSI scam that everyone was suggesting was a scam as usual. It was $3500 for two classes during the summer for everyone fucking year. This funding this year, however, was a fucking meme of $350. WTF. Like actually wtf. Why target poor kids. I already don't want to be here and will likely end up like the other two people who offed themselves this past week if I go.

I mean fuck. Why? Am i the asshole here? Yale is giving over $1k for their comparable summer program shit and Stanford, etc are probably much more. So Why? I am in hell.""

Let's do a cost breakdown right now of going to Princeton versus Yale for example. Yale's program actually only gives a $250 stipend. The number that they are quoting is reflective of the ""summer savings contribution"", which Princeton got rid of years ago because it disproportionately affected low-income students.

Beyond this, EFC 0 students at Yale still have to pay $1,600 every year unless, unless they do fsy (which only waives this cost in the first year). On the other hand, Princeton requires zero student contribution for the entirety of the education if you're EFC 0.

If you're curious as to why students previously received a larger stipend, but are receiving a lower one now, that is because that $3500 is ONLY reflective of the stipend over COVID. Students who took FSI over COVID had to take it from home, so this was to offset housing, books, and meal costs. However, at FSI in-person, there are 3-meals a day provided, a dorm room, and all educational resources covered. You are getting PAID to get taught two separate courses, which furthers your own educational career. Princeton is an educational institution, not a full-time job. Their focus is not to make you wealthy, it's to educate you. Be grateful about this, many FLI students have to pay and go into debt for such an experience.

Going further, the user also made this comment (here is an excerpt):

""THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE COME HERE IS THE FUCKING MONEY... WHY DOES EVERY . FUCKING. OTHER. IVY. CARE FOR THEIR FUCKING STUDENTS.""

I genuinely don't understand this point. Princeton is marketed as an educational institution, and I would wager a larger part of the fame of Princeton is around the ideals and education than the money (although I do not discredit the large endowment to student ratio is beneficial to the educational opportunities). An educational institution's job is to educate you, not pay you a full-time wage to go to the school. I can't really understand the privileged position this person is in, as they feel entitled to such an experience. I will say this as a matter of fact, NO school is going to give you the experience you seek. At MIT, at Yale, at any other school you will not be catered too as if you are some expensive commodity. They are giving you the opportunity of upward mobility, do you not see this?

Sorry for the long message all, but I thought I ought to publicly address some of this person's comments to give a full perspective to any other FGLI student who intend to come here. This person's experience is NOT representative of the truth. I am an FGLI student, I applied through Questbridge, and my experience as Princeton is not perfect. However, Princeton's FGLI resources have provided me the opportunity to be on a level playing field with students with significantly more preparation than I. I went to a school where they did not even teach Calculus, but I am able to go through the Physics curriculum because FSI gave me a head start.

And one could argue that if to utilize these resources I must sacrifice my mental health due to difficulty to gain access to these resources / terrible staff, I would understand. However, this is not the case at Princeton. The staff at the Emma Bloomberg Center for Access and Inclusion (EBCAO) are some of the best people I have met in my entire life, and they will go leaps and bounds to make sure you have everything you want.

However, there is a difference between being an FGLI student who needs to lean on EBCAO for support, and someone who feels entitled to it all. This student does, and their actions and posts point to this. Do not trust what they say.

I am an incoming intern for the summer of 2022. I will be doing some work at the GFDL, and I can't wait to immerse myself in the Princeton community. First, some logistics: 

\- I will be staying from June 13th - August 6th.

\- I will have a vehicle on campus

\- Will be staying in the ""Joline"" dorms

\- Will be on some kind of meal plan 

\- Will have a good amount of free time on the weekends!

I just wanted to consult with you all to see if I could get any ""insider"" information about Princeton. What are some things that I should totally do before I move out in August? Any tips for the best places to study? Are there any events on the weekend that I should keep my eye out for? In short, what should an 8-week summer intern know about Princeton University?

I've been asked to choose between residential college and upperclassman housing. Is there a price difference? Which option do you recommend and why? Is it possible to get access to the kitchen? (PS: I have already read all the information I could find on the Princeton website),1652991662.0,"{'Hey!\n\nBiggest difference is age of people living in them. Residential college will be largely 18-20 year olds (freshman and sophomores), and Upper class dorms will be 20-22 year olds.\n\nAdditionally, res colleges have more structure and have an associated dining hall. They will have events at the dining hall/dorm, you’ll have an RCA (like a dorm advisor), and in general a little more structure. Depending on which res college you’re in, you may be able to walk to the dining hall without going outdoors (nice in winter!) whereas this isn’t an option for the upper class dorms. Another factor is location - upper class dorms are more central to campus (in general). \n\nIn terms of kitchens, res colleges will have a common kitchen you can use, but it would be hard to cook regularly in it on your own I think. Some upper classman dorms (Spellman) are like normal apartments, with a private kitchen — these are popular and possibly not available to you, but are easiest setup for cooking on your own. There are also co-ops in upper class dorms where people use a common or dedicated kitchen to take turns cooking that would probably be open to you - but I think you’d have to wait to learn more / sign up until you are on campus. I don’t think there is a price difference, though dining hall meal plans are a significant difference across plans you can choose from.\n\nIs there a reason you want to cook on your own? Quite common to just eat in dining halls. \n\n\nHappy to answer anything else that is helpful!': ['Not OP, but want to say thanks for your reply, because it was very informative. Thanks again.', 'The dining meal plan is quite expensive; at least when I was there, living in a res college meant you were required to have a dining meal plan, which set you back several thousand dollars if you were cooking your meals yourself anyway.', 'Glad it was helpful! :)', 'They actually just changed it this year - upperclassmen living in res colleges are no longer required to get a meal plan.\n\nTo respond to OP’s other questions, at least to Princeton students, the price is the same, and there’s a lot of variation within each option. The newer residential colleges (New College West, Yeh, Whitman, Butler) are overall nicer than most upperclass housing, while the older ones (Rocky, Mathey, Forbes) are similar. Both have shared kitchens you can get access to, but the details vary by dorm. If I were you, I would go for res college, because your odds of getting a decent room are better imo, but I doubt it will make a big difference.', 'Ooh, is it required for upper class men living in res colleges?

I fell in love with physics in that class even tho it killed my GPA. Also go to office hours and study sessions, as the class is impossible without them. Don’t be afraid to drop down in math if you must to survive in physics, math here is not taught great at all and the goal is mainly to survive until you’re finished than to actually learn anything. The hardest part is getting through freshman year, if you can do that, you can do anything! \n\nAlso, be aware that many Astro classes are only offered EVERY OTHER YEAR, so plan ahead! Unlike other majors, the requirements are plentiful for Astro, so make sure you have a decent idea of when you’re going to take stuff. Talk to other people in the department as much as you can, and ALWAYS have multiple sets of eyes see your schedule to make sure it’s good.\n\nOverall, the classes are overbearing and stressful but the community is full of the nicest, most supportive people you’ll ever meet. Use your resources, and you’ll be fine. Get in touch with Neta Bahcall and Polly Strauss, they would LOVE to talk to you about the department and all of the research and opportunities we have.

I could have taken PHY103 instead and probably have gotten an A-/B+ without a whole lot of extra effort, as I was very familiar with the content already. I came into PHY105 and struggled greatly in the first half, and got a class-low score on the midterm. I did much better in the second half, and got a C+ overall (I was probably near the bottom of the class with a C in the first half, but doing pretty well with a B-/B in the second half). Had I been using my resources consistently, I probably could have ended the course with a B-, but again I was vastly underprepared (this was my first physics class ever with a teacher that wasn’t the internet), and students who were more prepared than me coming in got grades in the A/A- range. I feel like many freshman STEM classes are just “How much did your high school prepare you?”, and the amount of effort you put in pushes your grade up/down a notch from that. You can only do so much catching up to get used to Princeton Physics’ pace, so be proud of yourself if you keep up quickly and get an A, but don’t knock yourself down if you are immensely struggling just to get a B.

Yes, PHY105 will give you a bit of a leg up in part of PHY205 sophomore year, but by the time you get to PHY208 in the spring, it’s totally new material for everyone. Additionally, I’ve seen PHY105 turn several people away from physics/astro unfortunately, because of the sheer difficulty; if you can see that happening, just go with PHY103!

So I’m an (international) incoming freshman and was just going through the classes - do y’all think I should take 5 classes or stick to 4? Was choosing between: 
1. Econ - 110 (have a 5 in ap micro and 4 in macro)
2. Math 90/100 (not sure what to take)
3. CS 111 as I have no experience in it and think that it’ll be easier than 150? Plus I don't wanna spend too much time on it.
4. IAPA 110/Pols 10/400. (4 in ap comp gov if that matters)
5. ENGN 0090 (Entrepreneurship)

Do y’all think this is too much work or is it manageable? Was also wondering if taking the entrepreneurship course in my 1st semester wasn’t worth it as I’ll have a long time before I would possibly declare it as a certificate and idk I might even double concentrate! Any advice would be helpful!

Ideally, econ 110, math 100, cs 111, iapa 110 and engn 90. Potential concentrations are econ/econ apma/iapa/pols (dont think so as iapa is way more open)/something else?

i am a prospective transfer to brown from cornell and am very torn about my decision (due the 31st). i just finished my freshman year at cornell and am undecided in the school of arts and sciences but lean towards humanities/social sciences/policy.

my first semester at cornell was rough: i didn’t feel like i was meeting people i connected with, the clubs felt really cutthroat so it was hard to get involved, and the school as a whole is very STEM-oriented. additionally, i came from a pretty small hs in california so the size and east coast culture were a shock (not that either is necessarily bad but very different from what i am used to). academically, it’s been a grind but i was surprised that i actually liked that culture (not the cutthroat part but working hard) and have also generally liked my classes and profs. second semester was def better: i met more people/became closer with ppl i vibe with more but still don’t feel like i have a close group of friends that i can count on—more individual friends. i also enjoyed my classes more and joined some clubs i like.

having chosen where i was going in the pandemic (i took a gap year), i do know cornell wasn’t the best fit for me (pre-professional, large) but there are clubs/classes/people i have become attached to and the academics seem to be a good fit (i like the selection of classes and there are some cool majors that seem unique to cornell).

one of the worst parts about cornell is that it seems to be a joke that people hate it. while obviously not everyone is unhappy, there is a vibe of people wanting to get out. in contrast, i’ve been talking to brown students and transfers and visited the campus and people seem to (for the most part) be really happy.

however, i don’t know if a lot of the broader, environmental factors at cornell would bother me as much if i felt like i had a close friend group which may just come with time and sticking it out. that aspect doesn’t really seem like it would be helped by transferring. if anything, that would put me at a “disadvantage” socially.

i do think brown’s location and general environment would be better. in terms of academics for me, the two seem even. brown’s international/public affairs program is very unique but there are also things cornell offers that brown doesn’t.

ultimately, i am not sure if transferring (which would come with its own challenges, period of readjustment, and ofc no guarantee that i’d be happier) is worth uprooting what i have invested into cornell (since life there seems to be getting better as i adjust but also knowing it’s not a perfect fit).

obviously, i feel very lucky to have this choice but can’t read the future so any thoughts would be appreciated. thanks! :)",1653787864.0,"{""Incoming paragraphs of text alert lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrown's a very different school from Cornell -- apart from the fact that we're much smaller (both in terms of students & campus size), we're also majority undergrads (4/1 undergrad to grad ratio). Having visited Cornell before, I will say that in terms of nature Ithaca wins hands down -- however, Providence still has places to walk (not hiking trails, however) nearby (India Point Park and Blackstone Park are both within 20-30 minutes of campus. Providence is definitely a larger city than Ithaca, but I'd say that the area where Brown is located is largely suburban (you have downtown Providence on one side past RISD, and on the other the East Side with extremely expensive houses). In terms of safety, I'd say that other than being careful about walking down Thayer at night w/o another person, Brown's campus is pretty safe -- and we have free programs such as SafeWalk (student employees paid to walk students from point A to B at night) and OnCall (basically a free uber within a mile or two of campus, including Walmart) which help. Boston is also relatively close by (\\~an hour away on the MBTA, with a weekend pass being $10), though I don't go more than once or twice a semester.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Open Curriculum is definitely the big draw for Brown, and one of the reasons why I chose to ED here over Cornell (other one was I'm premed, and I liked that Brown had their med school & hospitals nearby vs. Weill Cornell in NYC, though that's not   an issue for you I'm assuming). I know Cornell has general eds, and while you've probably already taken some of them, the Open Curriculum is definitely great in that for the most part, people take classes because they want to take them and the ability to S/NC any class helps with exploring. Brown does have a party scene, but they're also a relatively large sub-free community and greek life is not super large on-campus like some other schools -- ymmv ofc, but I've met some of my closest friends here as someone who's not super extroverted. In terms of weather it's probably going to be pretty similar -- as someone not from the east coast as well I don't particularly enjoy it all of the time, but campus is really pretty during the Fall and Spring (and the winter before too much snow accumulates).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Watson Institute (where IAPA is housed) got a new building which is absolutely gorgeous. The Open Curriculum also makes it really easy to double concentrate or to study something else you're passionate about (take a class at RISD, learn another language -- there are 15-20+ here etc.) While intro classes are definitely large as with any school, most upper-level classes or seminars are decently small and for the most part, professors will give overrides if you show interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI definitely can't say if you should choose Brown or Cornell -- both are great schools, albeit very different -- but if the Open Curriculum and living in Providence is something that interests you, then come here :)"": ['hi! yeah, it def seems providence has a lot to offer and that brown facilities/overall campus resources might be more accessible and enjoyable. thank you sm for your response and thoughtfulness!'], 'For your goals, Brown seems better suited. IAPA is the concentration you would do here and it falls under the Watson Institute. It has received board approval to become the Watson School in 2 years. It has new buildings and plenty of funding. Its partner graduate program is more competitive now than CIPA at Cornell. Moreover, the grading curves at Brown are very accommodating . No +s or -s, and you can take most of your classes S/NC (pass/fail). Campus skews heavily liberal and sometimes it feels performative but in general people are very open. It is very different from Cornell.\n\nNow, given the above, you can definitely thrive in Ithaca. You are more experienced now and can make better calls regarding the use of your time there.': [""hi! thanks for the response!

115,BrownU,Prospective Transfer: Struggling between staying or going,5,uw945e,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/uw945e/prospective_transfer_struggling_between_staying/,5,0.86,"(not sure if this will get taken down because it’s not relevant or too long)

hello! although i know that ultimately this decision will be mine to make, i wanted to hop in to gauge some opinions. 

i’m currently a freshman at UCSD double majoring in  cognitive science design and computer art, and was fortunate enough to have been accepted to Brown. 

i hadn’t expected to like UCSD as much as i ended up doing so, but i’d been on the waitlist for Brown as a freshman applicant, and decided to apply to a few schools for transfer not expecting much. the quality of life in san diego is incomparablely wonderful, and i’d felt like i had really found my group of people in the beginning of the year. 

some more background academically: i want to eventually go into the tech field as a UX/UI designer, and think UCSD could equip me with the technical skills to achieve that. but, my main academic reason for transferring was that i also wanted to pursue an independent branch of tech, which is more ethical design and tech, which i feel like some of the theory heavy courses of Brown could benefit me with.

thoughts on UCSD:

pros:
one of the major draws of UCSD for me is that i can graduate in 3 years total with a two degrees (bs/ba) and a minor, saving me a whole year of out of state tuition. on top of that, again, quality of life: stunning weather, the best dorms and buildings in my college, and just amazing things to do near campus. 

cons:
that being said, i’d only be living on campus for one more year, and would eventually have to move out on my own in san diego, foregoing much of that immediate quality of life. additionally, UCSD’s size makes it really hard to form more meaningful connections with professors, and the colleges themselves can often feel segregated. i also feel like because of that difficulty in forming meaningful relationship, im just another designer produced out of the UCSD factory, where i have faith i can get a standard, well paying job, but won’t have much opportunity to sort of explore the niches that i’m really trying to break into. socially as well, i don’t feel as though i’m leaving much of a community behind, as i was very gradually isolated from the friendgroup in the middle of the year (which is natural ofc!). but yeah a lot of the people i’ve met seem to have existing ties from thruout california, making it a little harder to form new connections as an out of state sometimes, and by the time i graduate college, i’ll only have a handful of friends on the east coast, where i had hoped to originally end up working (but am honestly now unsure).

thoughts on Brown:

pros:
i have always been and still am extremely drawn to Brown for their curriculum and overall approach towards education, and am super excited about a lot of the opportunities i’d want to take advantage of. their open curriculum paves way for a lot of exploring and i’m excited to finally have the chance to take philosophy and ethics classes to really round me out, because while i like learning what i am at UCSD, i feel like i’m neglecting a lot of potential learnings i could get. 
in general tho, everyone i’ve met at brown also just seems really warm and happy and passionate about what they’re doing and id love to be supported and to support that energy.

cons:
as mentioned, i’d have to spend 3 years there (bringing me to a total 4 years of undergraduate education and an extra year of tuition in comparison to ucsd), and i want to double concentrate too, which means that i’d have to squeeze an extra class each semester until my senior year. this in itself is not a huge problem because i’m already taking extra classes each quarter at UCSD, but i’m scared it would limit the opportunities i might have to explore the open curriculum, because i would be solely filling out concentration requirements. another option i was looking at was independent concentration so that i could truly integrate design, cognition and ethics, but that is definitely a complicated route to get everything approved. socially, i am also a little nervous because i’m scared i won’t make friends as a transfer outside of my fellow transfers (which congrats to them too!!). i’ve heard that it’s definitely something you make of it, but just a little self conscious i think :(

in either regard, i’m extremely lucky to be already attending a good school and to have even had the option to choose another great school. thanks for reading through and would really appreciate some feedback!! :)",1653336515.0,"{'I think you should stay at UCSD.

Very few, if any, people stay within a transfer bubble.\n\n* Transferring is hard. Yet, transferring can be worth it. If you're not socially happy at UCSD, yes it might be a great advantage to graduate in 3 years, but would being happier for 3 years at Brown outweigh that? Conversely, if you're happy enough at UCSD, maybe just finishing it out is better than taking the risk of longer years and finding a home in a new school. \n\n* Never transfer for prestige, transferring is hard, and if you don't have a real reason to leave (specific program, wanting a different social environment, feeling unfulfilled etc) the challenges are going to outweigh the benefits of transferring.\n\n* Many departments and concentrations are very transfer friendly, especially if you're a soph transfer.

I did minimal work at CC and had 4.0. At Cornell, I had several classes where I was thrilled to get a B while busting my ass. Think about the student demographics; CC is largely average to below average students (some exceptions of course), whereas at Cornell, the typical student is top 1 or 2 percentile. Re: class size, if you\'re coming in as a junior, you\'ll likely miss some of the giant classes that many frosh and soph take, but you\'ll still have some big ones as a junior and senior (this can vary widely by major though). The biggest difference you\'ll notice is the pace and the amount of work. Something that you might cover in 2 or 3 classes at CC, will be covered in one class at Cornell, and then it\'s on to the next thing. At CC, you may get about 5-7 hours per week for a ""heavy"" class; that\'s considered light at Cornell. I had a few 3 credit classes where I was spending about 15 hours average per week. To summarize: it\'s much more demanding and rigorous than CC, and hard work alone won\'t always cut it; you need to be pretty smart as well. Best of luck!', 'Government classes can be pretty large, especially intro ones, but you will have smaller discussion sections to supplement that.

I couldn't decide between AEM and A&S and so I applied to SHA for fun also I saw the low acceptance rate at AEM and so I leaned into my host job and got in. The reason the major can be boring is only because it is so broad. Yes, the hotel administration major is broad. Idk ur exact interests but I like finance and so i find stuff like food management boring. but maybe u dont! It is unlikely someone loves finance, financial accounting, food management, and hospitality development. (ps i heard a rumor they arent making all the classes mandatory but instead optional with different tracks in like a couple years) Luckily, the classes are not usually that much of a grind so u can just focus on other stuff when they are boring. The major has a fair bit of elective space so u can just load up on other stuff u like. Another good thing is that the connections are rly rly good especially in hospitality and u arent locking urself into the industry whatsoever. I know a lot of hotelies that put business administration on their resume and no one thinks twice about it. u can check the employment stats but a lot of hotelies dont go into hospitality  (9% only) and instead just do finance (26%) or real estate (26%). the real estate is top of the line here. imo one of the best places to become a real estate analyst. the business dress fridays is called deans distinguished lecture series and its a 1 semester core course, so its not like a regular thing except maybe for a seldom presentation. its not that professional. hotelies are known for being pretty chill imo. im always willing to help out. ur other questions are a bit harder for me to answer but ill do my best. Ithaca is a super unique town so i think it should be a sizable consideration for ur college pick. super cool scenery and isolated i would say. although, the airport is quite nice just doesnt have a ton of flights. the depression meme is a person by person case i would say. there is a big greek life culture especially as part of the biz school. there are also plenty of people who avoid that kinda stuff (me). u can def have ur choice at that here. at least at sha, i would say people are generally happy. the professors at sha are for the most part phenomenal and caring. lastly, congrats!

If you're trying to be prepared for the course without access to pre-calc I would suggest spending some time watching Professor Leonard's Calc I series on youtube. He discusses theory and does a lot of worked examples, his lecture is good and I suggest it to most students.

in a really crazy turn of events I got off of the Harvard waitlist yesterday. it still does not really feel real and I'm very excited about the opportunity.

I don't have too long to decide so I figured id come on here to ask a few questions. just to help with answers I'm currently committed to another school with a great business school for finance. at Harvard id primarily do Econ but id love to also do global affairs or something of the sort. as of right now Im interested in IB/consulting but I mean who knows in four years that might change.

questions:

I feel like I always hear about grade inflation at Harvard and I'm curious what its actually like. obviously I'm guessing it's difficult to do well in the classes there but do curves help a lot or something?

what is the atmosphere on campus like? above all I want a school that is collaborative among its classmates. does it becomes especially cutthroat between Econ majors who all want to be placed in big 3 consulting or the major IB?

in general, do most people who want to be placed on a Goldman Sachs-level IB or Bain-level consulting get it or is it still a relatively low percentage?

this last one is probably really dependent on who I ask but what is the work/life balance like? I'm sure the classes will be super difficult and require a large time commitment, but how is the social scene?

I think this is most of them but I'll edit this or something if I think of others

thanks!",1653158813.0,"{""There's no social scene, but the campus is leagues better than Notre Dame. Notre Dame is basically a flavorless enclave with a few chains in a food court and a 1.5 hour train ride to Chicago, surrounded by a dying town and next to a richer town with a...mall.\n\nCambridge is an enclave of banks and Corp shops then some local shops, ready access to Boston via the T and the Charles river. More likely to get your bike stolen, but there's keytar bear and a guy who needs his flat fixed. I have issues with Cambridge but not compared to Notre Dame.\n\nIt's competitive, but everyone wants you to get to where you want to go and if you're doing the work you should get there (and if you got in you should be able to do the work). Life balance really depends on your program, but lives are overrated. You only get to do this once, try not to make the choice out of fear."": [], '>I feel like I always hear about grade inflation at Harvard and I\'m curious what its actually like. obviously I\'m guessing it\'s difficult to do well in the classes there but do curves help a lot or something?\n\nGrade inflation does not correlate to the difficulty of the course material and how much time you\'ll be spending outside of class. Harvard classes will be difficult. However, grade inflation definitely exists here. Not to the extent that everyone will be receive an A or it is easy to receive to an A, but the reality is in most classes the overwhelming majority of grades tend to follow in the B+ to A range and it\'s rare for people to receive Cs (or lower) in classes (even though it does happen on occasion). Ultimately, if you focus on academics, you probably keep your GPA over a 3.6 here (the average for each graduating class is usually over/under 3.65), but there\'s no guarantee you\'ll get a 4.0 or anything.\n\n>what is the atmosphere on campus like? above all I want a school that is collaborative among its classmates. does it becomes especially cutthroat between Econ majors who all want to be placed in big 3 consulting or the major IB?\n\nHonestly, compared to what we hear from other schools, I would say Harvard students tend to be pretty collaborative and it\'s not super cutthroat or competitive. Others can feel free to disagree.\n\n>in general, do most people who want to be placed on a Goldman Sachs-level IB or Bain-level consulting get it or is it still a relatively low percentage?\n\nYou\'re not going to find an accurate percentage on Reddit and it\'s hard to find the exact and accurate numbers (unless you do the research yourself and actively attempt to hunt down each graduating senior\'s postgrad plans). However, I do believe saying that ""most"" reach that level would be an exaggeration. No matter what university you go to, getting into those kind of companies after undergrad is difficult and it\'s probably a low percentage. That said, we\'re at Harvard, and I would assume compared to other colleges and universities, that we\'re up there with having one of the highest percentages.\n\n>this last one is probably really dependent on who I ask but what is the work/life balance like? I\'m sure the classes will be super difficult and require a large time commitment, but how is the social scene?\n\nIt  depends on what classes you take and what is your major. I\'m planning to concentrate in CS, and from my first-year experience alone, it\'s definitively more work than life and my prospective sophomore year courses are supposed to be more difficult. However, CS is one of the most time-consuming majors. For Econ, I would believe there is more of a balance + (again) it really depends on how much you prioritize academics.\n\nFeel free to PM with more questions.': [""Just adding on to the work/life point - Ec can be an extremely light major or a fairly time consuming one. There are relatively few required courses so it's really up to you how difficult you want to make it and what non-major classes you want to take alongside it.

They are very different schools and you need to think about which is a better fit for YOU, not which is the better school. \n\nND is gorgeous and the campus is the universe. This combined with the…sports fervor (very cool btw) creates a strong community. Harvard is embedded in Cambridge and adjacent to Boston and while most students don’t go to Boston all that often the proximity helps Harvard feel not so, well isolated. But the price for that creates a community that is not as cohesive as ND. \n\nMendoza is a pre professional program. Harvard is a liberal arts college, even if its Econ program is hearty. Both are just a different approach to education. Both will land you a job afterwards but HOW do you want to be educated? \n\nEcon at H. is huge with a pipeline to the Wall Street financial sector — but it’s huge and it’s competitive.

What people are doing is so different that when you meet someone, there is nothing you need to ""prove"". So, people are quite nice and will often just share fun stories. There are definitely cutthroat people still, but I ran into like 3 in my time here.\n\nCareer: yeah most do. I had 5 friends who were into consulting. Three are at McKinsey, one at Bain, and the other realized that his true love is CS. Probably a biased sample, but it still illustrates something. In general, Harvard career service is great & the name will almost always get you a first-round interview. Your task is to take that interview into an offer.\n\nSocial scene: since Harvard doesn\'t have greek life, most parties I went to are low-key hangout kind of vibe. Some friends having a beer over a game of beer pong or mario kart, for example.\n\nEcon is one of the more chill majors and you should have a pretty good balance, e.g. doing homeworks on weekday nights then you have Friday night & weekend free.

And almost every class has at least one midterm exam (some have two) and a final.\n\nMath courses usually adhere to the above as well, with problem sets due each week, although I never went beyond linear algebra and ODE, so later courses may be different.\n\nI usually encountered a similar coursework outline for core courses and “electives”.\n\nAnd btw, some courses will refer to regular hw as “labs” (eg Advanced Programming).\n\nIt’s all pretty manageable tbh, just be sure to read the syllabus and don’t overload yourself.\n\n**Edit:** Random aside, but you should totally take the Shakespeare course if they still offer it. You’ll get a chance to go to the “Rare Books” library and read Shakespeare from an original copy of the first folio and other priceless books.\n\n**Edit 2:** Since you’re an incoming freshman I’ll add the following advice: assume you’ll spend 10-20 hrs a week on each weekly assignment for each STEM course. You absolutely have to put effort into STEM assignments not only to complete them correctly, but to be prepared for the exams. Exams at Columbia were no joke for me, and all my STEM courses were graded on a curve. It does not feel good to go into an exam unprepared, and you’ll likely fucking bomb if you do.': [""Im planning on majoring in biochem.

Most STEM students organize their schedules carefully to balance the known intense courses with lighter ones. This also let's them compete for better marks in their classes.\n\nAt Columbia, some of the student body are literal geniuses, and the professors want to challenge those students along with all the rest of you. So, unfortunately, a lot of the homework is just plain hard. Also unfortunately, once you're an upperclassmen, you'll find a lot of this content is so high level, and possibly obscure, that it's difficult to find free* resources to help you complete the work. This is why many students rock a Chegg, probably a good investment.\n\nSo, if you're stuck on a problem, and the resources to help you literally don't exist online in an easily digestible format, then you have 3 options: use a teacher, use a friend, use the text. Each of which may or may not be helpful. Unfortunately, you may spend 6-7 hours on a single problem that you have no hope of solving. Doubly unfortunate, now you wasted time that you should have dedicated to other classes. So this will add up quickly.\n\nIn summary: balance known hard classes with lighter ones, know your professors, make some friends, get a Chegg. If necessary, learn when to cut your losses.

Edit: I’m a mech e major",1653490186.0,"{""Check with your advisor.  The school minimum standards are an overall gpa of over 2.0 so D's can count towards your *degree* requirements.  I believe (but you **have** to check with your CSA advising Dean) that you won't have a problem counting D's towards a general degree requirement as long as your GPA stays at a C or above.\n\nMajors vary.  In CS, for example, we allow at most one D to count towards the major, but that's in major courses.  Physics is a degree requirement not a major requirement, so for CS we wouldn't even consider that your one D.\n\nWith all that said you'll at the very least get an academic warning on your record.  But that's not significant unless you continue to get very low grades with any regularity."": [], 'Double check with your advisor, in some cases a D still counts as passing for major requirements.': [], 'If you couldn’t hang with rotational dynamics and the rest of kinematics in Mechanics, I’d strongly advise not taking E & M.  Most of Physics 2 coursework relies upon your Algebra 2/Trig chops (especially for phasors, optics, and fields + waves).  Integral calculus is used perhaps for the initial setup and diagraming of a problem—the rest of the calculations are garden variety math from say Blitzer’s Precalculus.\n\nSo much of physics is figuring out the “trick” to the problem (e.g., using COE + COM instead of algebraic kinematics to solve for v_final of a bullet shot through a wooden block that is normal to a flat surface).  Summer cram courses do not define *you* as a student; rather, you define what you actually want/need/would like to learn on your own terms.  \n\nI once challenged a Nobel laureate to a fist fight in the department parking lot after he said “you’ll never pass physics—ever (and other similar words of equivalent toxic effect).”  But in retrospect, I lacked the right attitude, approach,and math preparation to hang with the STEM class curve.  You really have to re-evaluate yourself on a very honest and personal level before running for cover in a non-STEM major.  Yet, after an honest self evaluation of your lack of success, future goals, and primary reasons for missing the mark, only come back to tackling the STEM core when you feel that you are truly prepared, improved, and ready.

I am trying to see if the pros of living downtown outweigh the cons of staying in the current apartment I live in. So far, the only downside to moving that I've identified is the additional transportation and inability to move to and from campus freely. In particular, I am a little nervous about taking the bus after sunset in the fall semester, especially when it starts getting dark around 4:30-5pm (I've developed a fear of taking the subway, so I don't anymore). Does anyone else have experience frequenting the bus from campus to elsewhere in the city after it gets dark? Is it relatively safe?

I hope you're in a better place now. \n\nJust wanted to mention an alternative that hasn't been brought up yet - if you're comfortable with cycling, perhaps you could consider using Citibikes or getting a bike of your own? The Hudson River Greenway connects Chelsea and campus and makes for a really nice bike ride: there are no cars at all and it really is just a dedicated cycling track, though there are some electric scooters here and there. It takes about 30-40 minutes of cycling one way, and on bad weather days, you could just take the bus as you'd planned to do in the first place. Having said this, I myself am located within walking distance from campus, so I don't quite know what the cycling track is like at peak commute times - I've only gone once for a leisure ride downtown with my friends on Citibikes.\n\nHope this helps!

There's a couple great profs, but in general, you'll find significantly more variety of upper division CS classes at a school with a larger CS program. This is not an issue for undergrad, but for a masters program focused on CS it will limit your breadth and growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The value of Yale on a CS resume\n\nFairly strong -- it's good enough to get you past a resume screen for nearly any job. But, a full-time job at Amazon is more significant signal for future employers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The ability of grad students to mingle with undergrads/socialize\n\nQuite limited. If you go in with the intention to mingle you probably can, but in my experience as a CS undergrad who took several upper division classes I don't think we knew any grad students well.\n\n\\-----\n\nFWIW many of my friends did the joint BS+MS ([link](https://dus.cs.yale.edu/bs+ms.html)) in computer science, those who did the MS have pretty much identical career paths and compensations so far (3-4 years out of graduation) as those who did not.

I can't comment on how much of an improvement it is versus your current degree, but it certainly wouldn't be a reduction in value.\n\nSocialisation: I find grad students tend to socialise with each other, and undergrads with each other.

I'm not sure how rigorous the courses will be, which scares me as I would rather not start off my Yale academic career with a less than stellar start. Also, I'm not great at math and it's been a while since I've done real math work, so I'm worried about diving right back into headfirst this summer. On the flip side, it'd obviously help with the transition into Yale. As a side note, I don't know what major or path I want to pursue, so picking the right classes would be tough.\n\n2. Friends.

I'm convinced that this would be a great opportunity, but I just have a few holdbacks.\n\n1. Rigor. I'm not sure how rigorous the courses will be, which scares me as I would rather not start off my Yale academic career with a less than stellar start. Also, I'm not great at math and it's been a while since I've done real math work, so I'm worried about diving right back into headfirst this summer. On the flip side, it'd obviously help with the transition into Yale. As a side note, I don't know what major or path I want to pursue, so picking the right classes would be tough.\n\n2. Friends. I think that FSY would provide me with a great opportunity to adjust socially and make good friends at Yale, but I also have my friends back home. This is essentially the last time I get to hang out with them for an extended period of time before we all head our separate ways, and to spend my entire summer at Yale would break my heart. I've been looking forward to this summer where'd I be relatively stress-free where I'd spend a ton of time with my friends, and going to FSY would obviously cap that.\n\n3. Am I even guaranteed a spot? It seems more people were nominated than they have spots, so it'd be annoying if I were to accept my FSY offer only to find out I couldn't go.

If you are concerned about rigor in general, you are much better off attending FSY than not.\n\nFriends - I can’t speak to this, other than to say that you will be very rewarded socially at FSY. Another commenter mentioned that FSY often leads to some of the longest-lasting friendships here, and from what I’ve seen/heard that is true.

Speaking from the point of view of a college senior, what I have to say about that is a little callous but true — I only wish I had more time with the amazing people I’ve met here, and the people you’re meant to stay friends with from high school will stay your friends, regardless of a summer spent away.

Might as well do it in the safest and most supportive possible environment!""], 'You take a placement test to get placed into calc 1, 2, 3, or statistics': [], '1) I personally have a strong background in math and calc, but there\'s a placement test to sort into 3 levels of math. If it\'s the same as when I went, it\'s Statistics, Intro to Calc I, and Intro to Calc II. The math course was only half a credit, so it was pretty much just two lectures and a problem set a week then a final. There are sessions with ULAs (tutors for the course) every week to go over the problem set material, and you can work in groups on the problems, so you can reach out to your friends if you don\'t understand something.\n\nDouble-spaced 12 point, and by ""research,"" I mean the kind where you check out a bunch of library books and cite some authors to make your points, not like actual primary investigation \n\n2). Your FSY info should have an overview of the curriculum, and beyond that, you can use the website ""coursetable"" to find descriptions, reviews, and difficulty ratings on courses, or you can check out courses.yale.edu for a class description and syllabus\n\n3). Yale has a distribution system for graduation where courses may have an attached ""distribution credit"" that can count toward the total you\'ll need. \n\nYou\'ll need 36 normal credits to graduate (as in, just make sure you get 4.5 courses a semester), but you\'ll need some of those to be ""writing"" courses, some to be ""quantitative reasoning,"" etc. \n\nYou can check all this stuff on your ""Degree Audit"" page on SIS, which I think you can access even if you have no declared major yet\n\nHere\'s a breakdown: \n\nWR:  Writing courses. These are usually assigned on the basis of whether a course will make you write about 20 pages of material, so they can be in any subject. Most students need 2 WR credits to graduate. FSY has English 114, which will give you your first. I did my second in a history class junior year. These are often seminars, so they can be hard to get into and you want to make sure you like the subject. (""Seminar"" meaning the class size will be limited to like 20 people whereas a lecture can have 300)\n\nQR: Quantitative reasoning. I think you need 2? but I never paid attention to it. Any math course will give you one, but there are also some science courses that will. There are a few courses that kind of flub the designation that the humanities majors love to take to avoid much math. \n\nL: Language. There are specific intro language courses to take so you\'ll know them. Most people need 3 semesters of one, but if you place into a high level at the start then it\'s fewer. These classes are a pain and a half because they meet 5 days a week and have daily homework and class participation. Needs to be completed by the end of your junior year. You can take an online placement test before the start of the semester if you want to start at an intermediate level in a language, or you can start learning an entirely new language at L1. \n\nThe others are more subject distribution than work-type distribution: \n\nSc: Qualifies as a science class \n\nSoc: Qualifies as a social science class \n\nHu: Qualifies as an arts & humanities class. \n\n\nThey use these just to make sure you get enough exposure. Most courses will have a subject designation like that, but fewer courses satisfy the work-type ones above. You can use coursetable to filter courses by the type of distribution credits they have when you start to schedule your first semester.': ['Is there a final for any math class that you would choose?

- can i get 7 hours of sleep every night and still stay on top of my schoolwork, extracurriculars and possibly a job? im probably gonna major in english or wgss and im planning to apply to the education studies program :)
- is it smart for an international student to apply early action? because yale is my absolute dream school and id like to have my college applications out of the way before i start preparing for my final exams (im also applying early action to a dutch university) but i heard universities often defer international students anyway because they want to be able to compare everyone in the pool
- if i use they/them pronouns, will that be respected? and generally how accepting are yale students & faculty towards queer students?
- what types of activities would i do during the international students pre-orientation thingy & would i already be able to live in my suite?
- are the astronomy courses that prerequire ""knowledge of elementary algebra"" hard? im definitely not a stem person anymore but i had an astronomy obsession when i was 12 so i thought id fulfill the science requirements that way, but because of the dutch high school system i wont have had any physics classes for the last three years when i go to yale (i will have the said knowledge of elementary algebra though)
- this question needs to be asked so that i have a counter argument to tell my mum: do yale students fly a lot? (as in by airplane) because my mum thinks ill be surrounded by people who fly like 8 times a year and dont really think about the environmental consequences of flying (which i do, a lot) while i think most yale students would be smart enough to not fly that much anyway that is sort of a discussion weve been having
- this last question may require a bit more explanation lmao but here we go: in 2019 i went to the west coast of the usa and one thing that really bothered me was how much sugar americans put in pretty much everything (bread, tomato sauce, you name it, there was sugar in it). now my question is, is this also the case in yales dining halls? because ive seen those ""what i eat in a day"" videos on youtube but obviously when someone says ""i had pasta"" i cant really know whether the pasta was sugary or not lmao (i guess my questions is just ""what do international students think of the food in yales dining halls"")",1651519900.0,"{""* Yes but it depends on how much time you want to spend on your extracurriculars, how many courses you decide to take, how hard you party, etc.\n* I have no advice there, I'm from the US\n* As some straight white guy, note that these are just my observations, but: The Yale student body is very diverse, very accepting, and very, very LGBT. If someone addresses you incorrectly it's probably accidental and they'll have no problem with you correcting them. However, there will always be some small minority still stuck in the past; I have heard some... unwelcoming conversations between people who thought nobody was listening. For faculty I have no idea, my perspective again is limited.\n* No clue, am domestic\n* You'll probably be fine. If you aren't at first, you can go to office hours and re-learn what you need, and then you'll definitely be alright.\n* I'm sure some do. I know some of the more well-off students travel frequently and I have no doubt much of it is by flying, especially during the year, outside of breaks. But overall I think Yale has a much greener student population than most colleges. Most flying, both out of time and cost, is probably out of necessity. To get home, I have to take a couple airplanes, but if you're close to home at Yale/want to visit somewhere nearby the train is at worst several blocks away and you can take it through all the major cities along the coast. Amtrak is not as regional as NS.\n* Good question. While I can't speak to the food from an international standpoint, I can say that it's definitely healthier than what most Americans eat; I lost weight over the first few months I was on campus. You definitely will have instances where there's a lot of sugar, though -- the ketchup is always going to be very sugary, you have access to soda (and ice cream/soft serve, depending on the dining hall), there's desserts, I'm sure there's more. But it is not hard to eat healthy, especially if you like broccoli and asparagus :) For a better breakdown of day-to-day meals, I recommend downloading the Yale Dining app and looking at what there is from day to day during the school year. Now might not be a great time because finals are going on and there's all sorts of events happening.\n\nI know that I can't really answer everything, but I hope this gets some of your bases covered. I'm just writing to get some info on your post in case nobody else provides anything substantive."": ['thank you!!'], ""Yale allows students who apply for EA to apply to other schools - *just not other private schools.* At least, this is how it was in 2020-2021.

Since many other private colleges in the U.S. have application deadlines in January/February or even later than that, you can still apply to many other places if you don't get accepted. What I would do is fill out all of the applications early since you like to get things taken care of, but don't submit them until you get your decision from Yale. Good luck."": ['thank you!!'], 'some things i can answer, i’m not international so i won’t speak for international students:\n\nthe students are very accepting of they/them identities — yale is colloquially known as the “gay ivy,” which is really a catch-all for a very lgbtq+ inclined student body. as for the faculty, yes, most of them tend to be accepting. as in any university, you may find an asshole or two amongst some older stuck-in-their-ways professors, but especially if you’re a wgss major or even in edstudies you won’t have any issue.\n\ni know little of the oiss (for international students, pre-orientation) social scene, but i do know they help you set up things like getting an american bank account and phone number. it’s very practical and from what i’ve heard from my international friends, very useful. you most likely will move immediately into your suite, as pre-orientation is now required for everyone.\n\nas for the sugar thing….it doesn’t feel like the dining hall uses much sugar? i’m american so that’s hard to gauge. you definitely won’t like the desserts but as for the main courses, many of them are not sweet at all. the pesto pasta for example definitely does not have sugar; i avoid tomato sauce so i can’t comment on that.\n\n\nas for flying, yes? we do fly a lot, but i think that’s mainly a function of living in the united states. yale is in the northeast so almost all of the northeastern students take trains home (the northeast has a much better train system than other regions) and we take trains to travel into nyc, but many of us are from the midwest or the west coast and it’s easiest to take a flight home. for example, i’m from around chicago — if i chose to take a train, it would take me 2 hours to get into nyc, and then another 19 hours to take the direct train to chicago (and this is only one-way). a 2 hour flight is more manageable with yale’s academic schedule. by that virtue, many of us are taking about -6 necessary flights per academic year (2 for thanksgiving break, 2 for winter break, and 2 for summer break), in addition to any class traveling (field trips to florida, etc etc) or conferences we attend.': [""thank you!! i'll probably have to take at least 4 flights a year myself as well (we dont celebrate thanksgiving in the netherlands), but i just wanted to make sure people dont just hop on and off planes the way my mum thinks they do lmao"", 'Just my two cents as a Yale grad currently studying in the UK. In my experience Europeans fly much more often than Americans. Flights are substantially more expensive in the US. There are no €15 Ryanair flights.

I'm a student at Emory coming to Yale this summer for some chemistry research. I don't really know much about Yale/New Haven but I'm hoping to meet some cool people and make some good friends this summer.

I'm 20M, studying Applied Math/Stats. I'm into math, guitar, olympic weightlifting (also curious about what gyms are nearby), filming/edits, drifting, history, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm decently outgoing and would be curious to find parties/etc. in New Haven too.

If you're here over the summer and we share any interests (or even none at all) definitely shoot me a PM! 

Also my program said I'll be staying in Yale housing but haven't given specifics yet so if anyone has any perspective on what that's like it would be greatly appreciated.

I was denied from a Penn dual degree program where you could combine a CS major with a major from arts and sciences. However, I got into Penn arts and sciences (my second choice since I thought this would give me more options). Now, to major in CS, I would have to either do an uncoordinated double major which requires a petition/good GPA or transfer to the engineering school. This seems very difficult to do. Would it be a risky move to attend UPenn?\r  \n\r  \nCornell:\r  \n\r  \nCornell permits students to major in CS from arts and sciences or engineering, which is exactly what I want. But should I give up UPenn for Cornell? People are telling me to 100% go to UPenn as they see it as more prestigious. Maybe this is biased information since I come from a NY school where lots of people go to Cornell.\r  \n\r  \nBrown:\r  \n\r  \nPermits students to major in CS from arts and sciences or engineering. Super flexible cirriculum if I change my mind. Did not expect to get in here at all, so I am not familiar with the quality of the CS department compared to UPenn/Cornell.

The condition is that you have to have another major within CAS to be able to do this (as in, you can’t only major in CS unless you are in SEAS).

I can't think of any opportunity (jobs, internships, conferences, etc) outside the school itself and the city it's in that youd have at Penn but not Cornell, so I say (as a very happy CS major at Penn) consider choosing more closely based on which school personally interests you more than prestige.

I just wanted to hop in and ask for some advice in choosing a school, as I’ve narrowed my choice down to these 5 schools. My parents are willing to cover the costs of any of the schools, but I’m thinking Duke is the obvious choice since the full ride makes it ~$100k cheaper than my next most expensive (M&T is actually my most expensive option and would cost me ~$180k more than Duke).

Duke also seems to be really strong in entrepreneurship (I read that the founders of unicorn startups like Coinbase, Neuralink, Airtable, Plaid, Cameo, etc. were all in the same years at Duke), so should I just pull the trigger for Duke or am I missing something about Penn?

Also I would be rrally grateful if you gave some advice on what we should be cautious when coming to Penn and USA. Thank you all very much in Advance.",1653837026.0,"{'You get an SSN when you apply for work authorization in the US. Depending on your visa, you may or may not quality for work, work-study, OPT, CPT etc and so it completely depends on your situation. TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR AT ISSS FIRST. They should be your first point of contact at all times.\n\nBut for both CPT and OPT it’s pretty straightforward. I can speak for the latter:\n\n1- You apply for OPT through ISSS at Penn (usually Spring of Senior year)\nIf approved:\n\n2- You apply for an EAD card *AND* your SSN— if you don’t already have one—at the same time.\n\n3-wait for your EAD card which gives you the right to work in the US in a field related to your major (e.g public policy if you’re, say, a poli sci major)\n\n4- Wait for your SSN which is usually sent around the same time maybe a few days after you get your EAD.\n\n5- hopefully during all of this you were applying for jobs because you now have the right to work anywhere in the US! Enjoy! The limit is 1 year for non-STEM and I think 2 years for STEM majors.\n\n—\n\nI believe there are other ways to get an SSN. But for the most part you get one when you get a job. I have a friend who did CPT so he got his SSN junior year over the summer. Not a labor expert so idk if what his company did was legal but my friend couldn’t get his pay til he got his SSN. So if you can, get it BEFORE your first day at the job.\n\nBasically, if you follow policy and the recommendations the ISSS gives you’ll avoid any of the horror stories. The only thing that might happen is waiting a long time for your EAD or SSN which can happen. So apply the first day you can for OPT or CPT whichever one you want.\n\nI got mine in 2 months.': ['What about campus jobs?

My amazing wife has applied for UPenn's online masters program in animal welfare and behavior. She's a busy working professional at an animal shelter. She is a behaviorist and has a bachelor's degree in psychology.

She has been wondering what practical benefits there are to this program. Will she be able to obtain a higher paying position with it? Will her knowledge of animal behavior improve to the point where it will greatly separate her performance from her peers?

The cost of the program is pretty significant, and she was wondering about the cost benefit ratio. There isn't much posted online about people's personal experience, at least as far as Google searches go.

Anyone who has completed this program with any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you, and I hope everything is awesome for you!",1653583293.0,"{'So I don\'t have experience with this program or with Penn Vet\'s online offerings, but I\'ll bite since there are no other responses. I recently completed a certificate program through Penn LPS Online; it looks like the structure was pretty much the same as well as the cost (although I did it for free being a Penn staff member) – it was 4 courses over the span of an academic year, one synchronous session per week and a couple of hours worth of recorded videos, one homework/problem set due per week.\n\nWhat I will say is that I had a very positive experience and picked up a very marketable tech-related skill. The instructors were extremely approachable and we ended up forming a pretty tight-knit cohort. However, I don\'t find that it has really given me much of a boost in my job search efforts – I think people see ""certificate"" and immediately think of Coursera or edX or the like, and the rigor of these programs is not widely recognized even at Penn. If I had the choice to make over again but had to pay full price, I don\'t think I\'d do it because I\'m just not sure the cost-benefit ratio would tip in the right direction.\n\nHowever, again, I don\'t have experience with this specific program or with the veterinary field, which may place a higher value on certificates. Plus the UPenn name never hurts, as long as you can emphasize that this was a full-fledged program taught by real professors and not a self-paced Coursera module that you rushed through in two weeks.\n\nAs a footnote I\'d say maybe encourage your wife to write into Penn Vet to see if they\'d be willing to connect her with some program alumni.': [""Thank you!

Apparently, Penn accepts NO credits for any college coursework done during the duration of high school. I think this would be fine for most people, but unfortunately for me, I’ve done more than half of my biology degree through courses taken at colleges when I was in high school. My old school accepted all the credits and honestly pretty much every other school accepted them except Penn.
