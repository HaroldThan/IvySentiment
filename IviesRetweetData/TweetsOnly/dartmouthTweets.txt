I don‚Äôt think its very constitutional to be using made up terms to coerce through deception the support of grieving parents, of failed communities, to let that very government disarm the entire US.@dartmouth What‚Äôs the difference between a 556 pistol and a 556 rifle?

One is used with two hands and can be shouldered with a stock, one is used with one hand and can be fired freehand. 

But to y‚Äôall, they are both assault rifles. 

They are trying to ban all guns.@dartmouth I said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, they are trying to take all of our guns and anyone who thinks that they‚Äôre not trying to take all of our guns doesn‚Äôt understand that assault rifles don‚Äôt exist. They want to ban all guns.@dartmouth Common sense gun control is a myth as most people don‚Äôt have the common sense to know that; AR doesn‚Äôt even stand for Assault Rifle, nor has the AR-15 been available for purchase since 1999. Everything they call an AR, is actually just a regular rifle.@Read_The_Rheum @dartmouth Nice@SarcasticCupcak @erikkain @GeorgeFromNY1 @dartmouth @GeiselMed Where is the study that shows the increased realism in graphics is a direct contributor to real-world violence as you strongly claimed above. 

I want evidence for that claim.

You provided a random study that does not in any way prove your point.@SarcasticCupcak @erikkain @GeorgeFromNY1 @dartmouth @GeiselMed agression =/= real world violence. People addicted to anything will show aggression. Its a product of psychology, not video games.

how about you actually produce a study that shows that video games have a direct link to any real-world violence.
