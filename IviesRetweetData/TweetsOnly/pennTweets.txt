As a longtime Friends of Schuylkill River Park board member, I saw the numerous challenges up close &amp; personal. Friends of Penn Treaty Park, what say you?@gbengadewoyin There's almost nothing you will see and not doubt once your mind is set to not believe. What kind of clip would change your mind? Blind seeing? You'll say it's staged. Lame walks? You'll say it's staged. Even if you leg grow, you'll say Penn and Teller can do better.Colonial Penn should tell the truth about their $9.95
plan/ month. It only covers a few M dollars. You have
to pay $9.95 to increase coverage. It is not enough
for burial unless you continue to increase the $9.95,
To get coverage up to 10 M at least.😳🤷🏼‍♀️In honor of Memorial Day, the bookstore would like to share in our Penn Community’s many thanks to all service members. https://t.co/ppMLzOttmPEvery commentator from Thomas Freidman to Mark Penn to Andrew Sullivan to Bret Stephens tell us “centrism” led by “moderate” Democrats is the best path forward for the party: So where are these “moderates” when we need bipartisan votes on gun control?  https://t.co/6H5xopBZJU@Rythmol81 Mother Nature#PennState researcher Esther Obonyo focuses on using sustainable materials to create buildings that can withstand natural disasters — while also working to bring the community voice to the forefront of design criteria.
