Great job, girls!@sfsclark @bariweiss @solveiggold @Princeton What a messed up view,  "missed opportunity" and that it has to be revenge. Do you feel the same about people who get raped or abused, that there is a cut off date for them to deal with it? How messed up@sfsclark @bariweiss @solveiggold @Princeton Yes, she does need therapy. If you read the article, that was one way the professor lorded over her, preventing her from getting therapy because he was scared she would reveal details about their relationship.読んだけれど、こういう主張(「自己」は幻影に過ぎない)をまるで数学の論文みたいにロジックだけで議論するのは無理だと思う。

https://t.co/GO89JgqOPx@Princeton has fallen. https://t.co/2r8CkNHNEm@SenTedCruz Lyin' Ted's parents were Canadians who owned a seismic-data processing firm, he went to private schools as a child/teenager, and he has degrees from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. He doesn't think he's an "elite"?@SenTedCruz You mean like elites that  attended Princeton University (B.A.1992),and studied public policy and joined a debate team, winning the top award in a national debating championship during their senior year,then enrolled at Harvard Law School,and graduated in 1995?That kind of elite?Just wanted to let Dan @NeubyTalks I’ve been watching #Terps semi finals vs #Princeton start to finish🥍🥍

No way this university comes out looking good. Why haven't more heads rolled?Just posted a photo @ Princeton University https://t.co/EyWpbgvJsrJoshua Katz should sue Princeton University for defamation and wrongful termination, with the payout award being the university’s entire endowment.

A disgraceful situation which is made moreso by your silence.What if Princeton alumni tried donating $.01 along with a comment saying what the University did to tenured Classics Professor Joshua Katz was unconscionable?

True, if 10,000 did so, the University would receive $100, which is $100 too much, but it would at least convey outrage. https://t.co/IRzVcZ1TjW@RoseSheinerman What a worthless joke of a pseudo-university

Now Erdoğan is the sultan, a single man who single-handedly appoints ambassadors, ministers  ext@SonerCagaptay @Princeton 8-From this period onwards, Erdoğan is now a sultan. To consolidate this, it also amends the regime and presents the constitution of the presidential system of government to the people's vote. But during the voting it changes the rules, unsealed votes are accepted.@solveiggold What a great article. @Princeton Dean is just like the Spanish Inquisition, burning everything alive on the name if DEI - they are on the wrong side if History@SonerCagaptay @Princeton 7- AND on July 15, 2016, a Gülen military coup is being carried out against Erdoğan. After the coup, the extraordinary situation was declared and the country is now governed by Erdoğan decrees. Now Erdogan has achieved the power he wants.When a college cares more about enforcing political orthodoxy than allowing free thought and so turns itself into the punchline of a "Simpsons did it first" joke.
