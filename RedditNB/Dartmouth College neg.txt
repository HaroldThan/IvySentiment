Skateboarding?

I’m a ‘26 and was wondering if skateboarding is a solid mode of transport across campus. Do most people walk? Would I be better off with a bike instead?

Would any current Dartmouth student mind sharing their resume?

Really don’t need a resume unless there’s something significant that isn’t on the rest of your application. I don’t think Dartmouth even lets you upload one

I would include it because if nothing else, it shows you cared enough to make and show it. One page, standard resume should do the trick

Change in Dartmouth acceptance rate in 2023?

No

I applied and my friend told me that results usually come out before June 10th

Undergraduate Admissions Office

The LLC application has disappeared in the darthub website - incoming freshmen can't apply to them anymore. Anyone know why it happened before the stated deadline of June 8th though?

I’m having the same problem. There’s just a blank space where the application link used to be.

Are there long term storage options? Do you just leave them locked up? What do you do with them over winter?

&#x200B;

The registrar website states that NRO can't be used towards the major but can be used towards prereqs for the major...does this mean I can NRO Econ1?

International student packing list

What should international students pack from home? What are some things that I should buy when I arrive instead? Do you arrive early to buy some dorm essentials or afterwards?

i’m not an international student but i had to fly across the country to dartmouth and i remember shipping packages directly from the website i ordered them from (stuff like bedding) to my dartmouth shipping address and then i just picked them up once i arrived. toiletries i bought at stores near hanover but since some were sold out with all of the pre-college purchasing you might be able to ship toiletries to yourself too

Hey! Incoming 26 wondering what the best type of laptop is for BME? I’ve read that there’s some sort of stigma against macs but what do you guys think? Anyone have any recommendations?

Also, not saying that you can’t do it, but be prepared to think about your majors and your plan. Because QSS is interdisciplinary, it’s course intensive meaning that there might not be enough space for you to double major. That’s just my experience. Most Qss minor in Cs or double

Major in gov/Econ only because of how much overlap there is. It’s definitely possible, just not sure if it’s realistic. Take classes in both though. Not telling you this to squander your dreams, just wish someone had told me this when I was a freshman

can i do an econ major modified with womens, gender, and sexuality studies?

title. sorry im a little confused abt how the modified major works, or whether id just be better off double majoring / minoring in my two areas of interest

okay thank you! :)

okay thank you! :)

walk on to rowing?

i’m a ‘26 interested in women’s rowing @dartmouth… and no prior rowing experience:) 

Very feasible. Crew as a sport is known for having people join with no experience and then gone on to row at the Olympics. 

yeah of course:)

Looking for off campus home to rent

For the Spanish lsa+, is the application process competitive and do you have to be fluent when you apply?

I’ve played the piano the last 2.5 years or so, and I’m a ‘26. I’d like to continue this, but I’d say I hover around an intermediate skill level. Is there an expectation of how good a student should be to enroll in this program? Do IIP students—especially piano students—recommend it? How has your experience been? What should I expect? I don’t intend to major in music, it’s just something that is important to me. 

do you know how long the lessons are? i took violin lessons throughout high school so im wondering how similar it will be to that.

Least competitive major at Dartmouth for undergrad?

Hey guys, I m aspiring to apply to dartmouth for undergraduate I would like to know which major is the easiest to get into because I have heard that computer science and social studies majors are extremely competitive.

But we have to choose the intended area of a study in commonapp college application

Dartmouth doesn't admit by major. You actually don't even declare it until the later part of sophomore year.

The thing is my class 11th is PCM means I am a physics chemistry maths student but my extraorichues are related to social science so I am confused what to apply for computer science or government or some you know political degree

Also my SAT score is 1440 with 680 in reading n writing and 760 in maths

Actually my extra curriculus are related to social science and my sat maths scorel is 760 reading and writing score is 680 but it the same time I can also propose a project for computer science th

o I don't have any extra curriculars in it so I confused what to choose computer science or political science

However I have a good idea to relate my social science extra curriclose with computer science and I have a project in mind which I can propose for computer science but at the same time my extra curriculars are related to social science and that's what makes it so confusing for me

‘24 here, I’d recommend you say you want to study business. I know literally 0 business majors, definitely the least competitive, good luck!!

Hum 1 is one term and Hum 2 one term. Hum 1 satisfies the writing req and Hum 2 satisfies the seminar req

Question regarding the Creative Writing Concentration

I am a prospective student and I want to know how it works. I want to double major in English/Comparative Lit. + Philosophy/Film and minor in German/or any other cool lang. Can I still opt for a creative writing concentration?

Can you explain me if this a part of the English major or is it something separate? I am so sorry, I am unaware of how the course structure works.

Can you elucidate on the distribution requirements? What does that mean?

There are concentration tracks in some majors like Engineering B.E. and English but isn't available for most majors.

It is part of it. English major consists of \~ 10 ENGL or CRWT courses. If you do the creative writing concentration you have to take a track of CRWT courses.

The original comment doesn’t know what it’s saying. I was a double major in film/media studies and English with a creative writing concentration. Totally doable, it’s a part of the English major with specific classes attached to it

You have to fufill 9 areas of distributives through courses at the school. They can double as classes for you major though. It’s 1 art, 1 lit, 1 Thought meaning and value, 1 international study, 2 social analysis, two sciences with no lab, and one science with a lab.

Dartmouth doesn’t have anything under the lines of “concentration”, but you can do two minors. You can also modify a major to encompass multiple studies. That sounds like a cool plan but one thing to keep in mind with dartmouth is you have distributive requirements (~9 classes) so that’s quite a lot of things. I only know of about 2-3 people (I’m a senior) who have successfully completed a double major + minor

I think so because the concentration doesn’t add extra classes you need for the major, just 4 of your English classes have to be Creative writing too

Creative Writing is a track within English major so yes you can do that as long as you are declaring English as a major regardless of whatever double major or minor you do. You just have to take some courses that are 'concentrated' in CWRT as part of your English major course selection.

\- Also, consider the modified major options or even the special 'create your own major' option as 2 majors + another minor is like 26 courses of the 35 or so you'll take not including 9 distribs. It's doable but leaves you with less flexibility with scheduling as not all the courses are offered every term or sometimes every year.

Many comparative literature majors also have a language focus and include another field, like film or philosophy, which might be the best option.

is it worth it to join an LLC? What house are u sorted into if u decide to leave the LLC sophomore year? what are the stereotypes associated w LLC students?

Also you’ll only really be missing out on the freshman dorm culture with an LLC. As you know Greek life is huge at Dartmouth so whether or not you join a frat or sorority sophomore year matters more.

how do i get involved in research?

First, ask any friends and upperclassmen how they did it. 

Third, email everyone in the department you’re interested in. The worst they can do is say no.

I had a 32 (which is about a 1440 or lower even) on the ACT and a few lower takes of the SAT and ACT. And I got in with the class of 2025

Visiting Campus Area Over the Summer

Hello, I am a rising sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin. I am from Dallas, TX but I’ll be spending the summer in NH since my mom lives here. I was wondering what is in the area that might allow me to potentially meet people as a non-Dartmouth student. Or, just what do you guys recommend for me to do for fun.

Meeting a stranger from the internet isn’t the best idea, but I feel inclined to accept this offer 😂

On the housing form, what exactly do they mean by gender inclusive housing and bathrooms?

I think so, but some dorms have gender inclusive bathrooms that are single use (anybody can use them). That might be what they mean

There are no gender exclusive dorms at Dartmouth. Some dorms have half baths in the rooms. Other dorms have gender inclusive bathrooms (single stall, anybody can use). That’s what they mean by gender inclusive.

Most dorms have gendered bathrooms (communal, one for each gender) on each floor. Especially for freshmen.

New Employee Questions

&#x200B;

Also since I'm 21, I'm still very much interested in meeting people my age but from what I can tell a lot of social life here is greek life based and/or restricted to students (Kyle concert, intramural sports, barbecue I was denied at, etc.). How can a 21 year old non-student meet people here? 

I also had a question about the AT bus. I have been given a parking spot in Dewey lot but that means a long walk to my office which limits the time I have for lunch. I believe that bus runs from Dewey lot to the Thompson lot (athletic fields) semi-regularly so is that an option or do I just need to get in shape and walk the mile or so?

I’m the director of creative media for football program

As for a social life, I would recommend walking around campus, the gym, etc. can I ask what you’re doing?

I’m the director of creative media for football program

Was talking to my brother at Yale the other day and he told me that a lot of celeb kids go there. Is it really true that children/relatives of A-list celebrities/TV personalities etc are currently at Ivies/T10s but current students are supposed to be lowkey about them?

It’s definitely a bit of a weird question to ask online lol. I think if one happens to get to know them it’s all good but seeking to know who attends a specific institution is just kinda weird at best 😬.

Roger Goodel’s kids go here but they changed their last name to blend in

any advice on off-campus living? (transfer student)

Lots of sketchy landlords who scam kids out of security depostis, ask around on who’s good/ not good

Do parents come to homecoming usually? Mine want to come but idk if that’s a thing

Have Dartmouth 2022 transfer decisions been sent out?

^^^ also throughout my four years here I’ve never seen someone use common room features as dining halls are all super close and most will find a friend or two that will bring a tv

Some dorms have a micro fridge. But double check. And not many people stay in their dorms. I don’t get back to mine until midnight everyday.

Hi all, I'm an incoming '26. Just checking to make sure I am not missing anything - I haven't gotten any emails from Dartmouth about next year other than their emails last month regarding ways to learn about the school. I also haven't received an email about making a Dartmouth email. Is this where most people are at right now?

i’m a 26 too and at the same place w everything! :)

Hi! I’m a current freshman living in the dorms at UCI, and I’ve put together some shoppable collages for everything I use on a daily basis! Let me know if you have any questions and I’d be happy to answer :)

1.) your mom

If I bomb my AP Spanish exam, can I still get exemption from the language requirement if I do well on the placement test?

Edit: to be fair, I know that's the case for several majors but I don't know the specifics of the language requirement

Yes, I didn’t have any AP test credits but I was able to test out of all 3 levels of Spanish from the placement test.

for the classes that give credit does that mean you don’t need to take the credit or you can take a different class to fill the credit but you still need to take a class? Also, does it make sense as an engineering student to place out of a calc1 or introductory physics class?

Just gut off the Waitlist for the Class of '26. I am so nervous and excited. But I might get all C's in my final grades. I also have a valid reason. I was preparing for my country's entrance exams for colleges which is just a month away. Can I explain this to the admission officers or will it get me rescinded?

Getting all C's in your final semester sends a bad signal to the schools. Will you be resilient enough to endure the rigor and the 10-week quarter pressure at Dartmouth?

TVs; End of Term Move-Out!

I was recently admitted under the waitlist for Dartmouth. However, this semester I may get a C in a difficult chemistry class at my high school. Would getting an A, B, and a C this semester cause me to be rescinded if I had near perfect grades before 2nd semester senior year? I’m pretty anxious right now.

what major were you interested in and when did you send your LOCI? I sent my loci wayyyy to late (two days ago lol)

environmental science and I sent my loci around April 15

wait when did you get off the waitlist? How did they tell you?

Also some background Abt me, my parents did force me to guitar school as a kid but I hated it and have forgotten most of it.

i am referencing scores from exams that i will be taking in the next two weeks.

I'm not a member of the admissions committee, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I highly doubt it.

i have no idea how i’ll do on my upcoming exams, but let’s just say i don’t have much optimism.

Are you sending them in?

If they’re bad just don’t send them in. But even if they were bad I doubt they’d give a shit tbh. I knew plenty of ppl with 1’s and 2’s on random APs

i have no idea how i’ll do on my upcoming exams, but let’s just say i don’t have much optimism.

Lead guitarist/Backing Vocalist Starting a Rock Project in the NH/MA Area *READ ENTIRE POST IF INTERESTED*

I am a 21 year old living in NH who has been playing guitar for more than 8 years at this point and am also capable of backing vocals, which I intend on doing both for this band that I am putting together. I started playing guitar being inspired by punk music, but have since expanded my taste over the years to include all kinds of rock music. I have played in bands and have experience with live shows. I go to a different school but I figured that I would reach out here figuring that there may be a lot of you from NH as well!

This will be a very intense band. I'm looking for bandmates that can make themselves available at least twice a week on weekdays. We will practice for 2 hours every practice, give or take 30 minutes depending on the speed at which we are able to accomplish our goals for that night. Every member will walk into the first practice knowing the entire repertoire I have planned by heart so that all we need to work on is developing chemistry and sense of dynamics within and between songs for that practice and all those afterwards. In terms of performing live, I seek to do this at least once a month. We will work on original material, however, I have already written the majority of the material. We will start with all covers and slowly incorporate original works as we play more live shows.

Here is what I am looking for from each individual member:

Here is what I am looking for from ALL members besides the previous points I mentioned earlier in the post:

2. Playing your instruments in your role of choice in this band for a MINIMUM of 4 years.

Now onto audition materials. There are five songs for this audition. They are as follows:

2. Welcome to the Jungle - Guns N' Roses

This is not the full set, and at this time I am unsure if all of these songs will make the final cut for the first full repertoire, however, I am sure that 3 or 4 of them will. If there are any changes, I will let you know later via DM (I will explain that shortly). All musicians must audition all of their parts for each song. Rhythm guitar does not need to take any solos, and only needs to be able to sing How Far We've Come, Dreams, and Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting). Keys only need to play on the three songs previously mentioned, and sing on the other two. Bass players do not need to audition backing vocals, simply indicate that you are capable of doing it.

1. DM me indicating your interest, your role of choice, your general availability over the next 3 months, and how you meet all of the criteria listed above as well as any additional information you feel like sharing about yourself. I will then provide you a time frame (and any potential changes to the audition set, if any occur) in which you are allowed to submit your audition material to me. DO NOT SEND ME YOUR AUDITION MATERIAL ALONG WITH YOUR INITIAL MESSAGE INDICATING YOUR INTEREST OR I WILL RULE YOUR SUBMISSION AS VOID.

Management has put Keggy on probation

Would it be okay to mention Keggy in one of my essays?

Lol no

100% do not mention Keggy in your essay. Why on Earth would you make any reference to campus drinking culture in your essay when 1) you're most likely under 21 and 2) you probably have many, many more things about Dartmouth or the Hanover location that specifically appeal to you aside from Keggy that you can speak to. Risky topic. Don't do it.

Thanks a ton! Can't wait to (hopefully) attend Dartmouth 😭

i mentioned it in my salutatorian speech about how our dr seuss school has a keg for a mascot but don’t talk about it in ur essay the traditions at dartmouth that you can talk about are easily more than enough with that being said we all fuckin love keggy and i personally consume more keystone light than i do water good luck buddy roll kegs

Questions about studying CS at Dartmouth

2. Where do students normally tend to go after graduating? What kinds of companies/grad schools?

(if it helps, I'm currently choosing between dartmouth and williams)

Do you have any idea the kinds of research Dartmouth offers for AI and other areas of computer intelligence? Ik they have a few classes but it just doesn't seem to be a big focus at the school.

2. Usually software engineering. Not many go to grad school. Most popular companies they work at are usually something similar to big N/Fanng like microsoft, uber, doordash, snapchat, google.

4. Look into DALI lab! it’s basically a part time pre professor software engineering/development job that pays around $10-15 per hour.

I’m going to Dartmouth next year and I’m signed up to take these two exams this year. Since they aren’t in Dartmouth’s chart for AP credit, is there any reason for me to take them?

Why does that even matter? If you are already admitted to Dartmouth your hs gpa has become irrelevant

I’m in the same boat, I’m taking 5 ap exams and Dartmouth doesn’t take any of the credit but I still have to take them otherwise our school doesn’t weight our GPA as AP 🥲

Has anyone asked thier admissions counselors at Dartmouth if they have to take AP tests?  If the tests were listed on the common app as going to take this spring do you have to follow through and take them or can you skip them if you know you won't get a 5 or don't want to skip the class next year?  Anyone know?

How big is the DPlan actually for finding internships? Is that the only major benefit of it?

Additionally I'll add that I'm a grad student with not many undergrad connections and yet I know three undergrads who are going to FAANG after graduation this year.

Are there less internship opportunities during off months though?

No. Some specific programs (like freshman ones for the underrepresented) are summer (you can’t even use the d plan as a freshman anyways), but usually all internships are available year around

Why did you choose Computer Science at Dartmouth?

Can I know why you guys chose computer science at Dartmouth specifically and not any other college? Also, if I wanted to take a few game design courses next to software engineering core courses just to pursue it as a hobby, is Dartmouth the right place?

I didn't come here thinking I'd do CS, but the alumni network for tech, consulting and banking is fucking insane.

I'm a grad student going to Dartmouth next year for CS. I went to an undergrad school that didn't offer any CS, and I'm really interested in game design/programming, so getting a grad degree in CS is something that is worth my while regardless. I applied to a ton of schools, and while some of the big California schools (Berkeley, Stanford, USC) might be better for game industry connections due to their location (and not to mention some of the best cs programs in the country), Dartmouth is much closer to my family, and is a 2 year program while some others are only 1 (I'll need the extra time since I have a small cs background).

This was the only place that accepted me. A lot of grad students come here because its the only place they got into 😅

I am an incoming Dartmouth Master program student. I am looking into housing options at this moment.

4. Open-ended question: what other problem did you encounter?

Research at Geisel School of Medicine

Yes you can! I did research at Geisel when I was an undergrad. Pretty much just emailed the PIs and got a spot. 

How do quarter schedules work?

I'm a high-schooler that wants to apply to Dartmouth, and I was checking the website. It said that there are 4 ten-week quarters per year, but the website said students only take classes for 12 quarters. That leaves one quarter each year without any classes. Is this right?

The 4 quarters a year include summer, so almost everyone takes freshman and junior summer off. Because of sophomore summer, you also wind up taking one "normal" academic year term off during sophomore or junior year.

* Fall - Early September - Thanksgiving

* Spring - Late March - Early June

* Summer - Late June - Late August

The sophomore summer is required as far as i know

Visa issues for full year abroad for internationals, significant research or job opportunity, financial hardship, health issues https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/enrollment/petitions/

handling school expenses together

Hey everyone! I’m an accepted student and was wondering what the south asian/indian-american community is like at Dartmouth. I’ve grown up in a pretty white town and have always wanted a sort of “brown community” around me to just talk about our common culture and experiences. Would I get this at Dartmouth?

Current first year student here! Tbh, had no idea about the South Asian Students' Association here...could be in part due to lack of advertising around campus. 

I'm neither the original commenter, nor South Asian, but is there something more specific you're looking for? South Asian Student Association, dancing, sports?

Math at Dartmouth

How many math credits/classes does a non-math major need to take?

None technically, depending on your major. A lot of majors have math 3 and/or math 8 prerequisites (the equivalent of AP calc AB and BC respectively). There is a QDS requirement for all students, however (fulfilled by stats or math).

Do the theatre students generally participate in fraternities/sororities or do the theatre students have their own little community outside of Greek life?

A good number of the theatre students are part of Greek life, but I imagine they are also a pretty tight knit group on their own from what I’ve seen from people on campus since they do productions and such together.

Is the ethics minor still a thing?

I can see it in ORC and the minors list and the requirements but the ethics institute links there end up nowhere and the Institute website shows nth regarding the minor. Also an alumni told me it might have been disbanded.

Timetable

Hi! ‘25 here, no need to pay a fee. All students have free gym access. You just have to scan in with your student ID.

Those were almost certainly from an area high school. The College does not have driver's ed to the best of my knowledge.

On Dartmouth’s website it mentions that they give out institutional loans. I wanted to know if anyone had any experience getting these loans because I asked for one (I can take out private loans to meet my efc) and I haven’t got a response back. Just wanted to know if this was still a thing or if this is outdated information.

I'm not sure if it's different for domestic students but this is what the finaid office told me.

hi, I’m a prospective Dartmouth student and am wondering what the campus culture is like if you are NOT involved in greek life.

I really like a lot of things about dartmouth, but the intensity and involvement in greek life definitely deters me, and I’m wondering what kind of student activity exists outside of the part scene. bc I’m a lamo and do not enjoy parties.

one thing about dartmouth that i underestimated was how central greek life is to a majority of students here. this is largely because of the lack of other nightlife/amenities existing beyond dartmouth itself in hanover/nearby area. for background, i'm a freshman, but i'm just not into drinking/partying. 

Fall term course selection?

Hi everyone! I’m a ‘26 and have been thinking about what courses I might want to take this fall term. My intended major is neuroscience on the pre-health track, and I know that on average students will take 3 classes per term. 

I was wondering if anyone has suggestions as to what courses I could take. I’m looking for a mix of harder and easier classes that I could take to fulfill my requirements while not completely ruining my GPA. 

2 classes I’m considering are Math 3 and Psyc 6 but I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to take both in the same term.

take placement exams for the types of courses you know you’re going to take (e.g. math, chemistry, biology) so you don’t waste time taking courses with content you already know.

Ok yeah sounds great how can I reach out to one of the organizers about joining. I messaged them on ig and they didnt respond

I’m a 26 and was wondering if we will have breaks in between the 10-week terms apart from the normal winter break/D-plan term off. If so, how long are they?

Breaks range from 6ish weeks from Thanksgiving to New Years to more like 2 weeks between the other terms.

I don't know if anyone has explained the D-plan to you, but you don't take all 4 terms every year. It's a system where you pick 3/4 (on average). Freshman and senior year is your traditional Fall through spring with the summer off, but sophomore and junior year you pick (except sophomore summer has to be on).

no, we actually have classes 52 weeks a year

unexpected dorm room recs?

what’s something that you didn’t expect to need/find helpful? or something that’s totally unnecessary?

I notice a lot of ppl use scooters or bikes on campus. Are they really that useful?

So do you still lock it up if it’s foldable while you’re at class or something tho?

As part of a consulting project, my team is currently collecting data by surveying and interviewing dozens of college students across the country in order to better understand student preference, sentiment, and behavior towards innovation in financial services (e.g. app-based brokerages, digital banking, etc). In an effort to further a student initiative, I kindly ask for your collaboration by filling out this quick 3 minute [survey](https://forms.gle/uyvv2bt9V4qaBhdh9)! Also, please indicate that Marden referred you to this survey.

Incoming masters student here (MS in CS with concentration in digital arts) - can anymore tell me a bit more about the DALI Lab? Is it essentially students working in teams on various projects (and getting paid for it)?

When do you first know your roommate? Is the first time on move in day?

You get an email telling you about housing updates and it tells you who your roommate is and their email address.

financial aid negotiation

dartmouth is my dream school but they're giving me 0 aid. tuition is more than my family's total post-tax income. we don't really have savings, and tuition is about double my FAFSA's EFC. how can i negotiate for financial aid? should i mention other colleges i've been accepted to and am willing to turn down for dartmouth or is that faux pas?

I'm so glad it's helpful : ) HMU if you end up visiting or going here!

Thank you so much! in my case, i got screwed over by aid depts. everywhere, so don't have any offers per se to compare. this might be in part due to the fact that im a us citizen living abroad.  im definitely expressing my interest in dartmouth cuz id srsly love to go, cost is a pain tho.  i have a younger brother who'll go to college the year after i graduate, not sure if that'd play a role.

Grad roommate for 2022 fall

Which carrier has the best cell phone coverage on campus?

I used AT&T for my four years. I never had any issues, and if your phone permits Wifi calling, switch it on and you’ll never have to worry about dead spots.

I'm anxious! I don't have a single close friend at high school. I'm scared that I won't be able to make any friend at Dartmouth. what shall I do?

Every freshman is entering a new and unfamiliar situation this fall, you are not alone. I’m also nervous about making friends but what worked for me in the past is joining clubs that I care about, volunteering because I got to bond with people, and approaching people when they are alone to start small conversations. It will be okay :)

[deleted]

1. During move in/ first week, try leaving your door propped open, and meet people on your floor

5. Wear sunscreen

That was me as a Freshman, not uncommon, quickly made lifelong friends (will be going back for reunion and staying with a college roommate)

Dartmouth is my first choice school and I plan on applying ED there this fall. I'm doing an English Lit. + CW major and I just wanted to ask about the overall experience of studying English Lit. there.

There is a "concentration" in Creative Writing within the English major.

How would you describe your overall experience at Dartmouth? I've heard that there is a lot of racism happening on campus especially against poc.

Yeah I’d also like to know about racism on campus

“Our offer of admission is made with the expectation that you will maintain the level of scholarship and personal excellence that characterized your candidacy. Accordingly, we will carefully review your performance during the remainder of your senior year…if you enroll we ask that your final transcript shall be forwarded to the Office of Admissions

Depends on a lot of factors. If you had straight As all through high school and that was a high point in your application, admissions might have some concerns about grades dropping in multiple classes. Dartmouth cares a lot about “intellectual curiosity” and senioritis is sorta antithetical to that premise. I would avoid getting Cs if at all possible. Bs most likely wouldn’t be an issue.

idk about you but i basically got a letter in august that said “we accepted you based off your original grades, make sure you don’t fall behind at dartmouth and ask for help”

i got a bunch of Cs and a D or 2 my senior year and wasn’t rescinded.

I got a C+ and a few B’s my senior year, got an email that suggested I use the academic resources on campus once I got to Dartmouth but they didn’t actually say anything about rescinding me
