Language Placement (specifically the Latin Placement Test)

Hi everyone! I'm an incoming freshman, and I was wondering if any of you have taken the Latin placement test. I'm not sure exactly what to expect, and I was also wondering how well I would have to do to place out of Latin entirely.

I've taken Latin since the 7th grade, but unfortunately I wasn't able to take the AP exam because my hs didn't offer APs. I'm really hoping to place out of Latin so that I don't have to worry about my foreign language requirement.

Hey! Just took it last year (‘25) and from I remember, they gave a few passages (AP level?) and had 2ish portions. The first was comprehension (what this means, case, function, one-line answers or brief responses). The second was straight translation. Pretty much aligns up with AP style questions imo. Hope this helps — good luck!

I took it 20 years ago with Ed Zschau. Fun class. Mostly reading HBS studies and a little bit of accounting basics.

How much is a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment or house near campus?

Summer Housing from June end to Aug end

Where to find summer housing in Princeton ?I'm a UMich student who's going up to Princeton for an internship over the summer so am looking to hopefully sublet an apartment from a current student. Any recommendations??

Hey Umich Intern,

Typically (~95%), Princeton students live on campus in university housing.  Finding a student with an apartment will be very difficult.  

Senior thesis

Yep, keep in mind that AB COS still requires a thesis. BSE requires a semester of independent work when I was there, but no thesis.

Technically ORFE can do a senior project but I believe it is extremely frowned down upon so basically everyone writes a thesis

Film classes at Princeton?

I know Princeton doesnt have a proper film major, but I'm not looking to major in it anyways. I was unable to find many film classes on the course catalog. Am I looking in the wrong places, or are there really just no film classes?

There’s a few classes for film analysis. In terms of film production, those tend to be one-offs (look up Princeton Atelier)

I’m taking a German film theory class next semester, and I’ve taken a Japanese cinema class. I know they offer classes on Chinese, Italian, French, noir & screwball, environmental, and South Asian film.

Visa assistance for newly admitted international students?

Does Princeton offer any assistance to help newly admitted international students obtain their Visa on time? Is there a good contact person at the University to ask about this?

First off, right off the bat, I must say I am not selling anything and I certainly don't want any contact info. I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of *free* resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online.

Just in time for graduation and/or summer break :)

Whether looking for an internship, your first career job, or *actually* good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt.

2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)

7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.  

This is *KEY!*  

Ex: "Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America." See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?

9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.

10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

\------------------------

I don't want that for *anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

What do you mean by “focus”? I think I’m dumb and can’t get what this means exactly. What do you grad students wish they had?

graduate students are indeed regarded as subhuman /s

nah but just look at the undergrad and grad population size here compared to ex. harvard

that doesn't sound too bad... to my knowledge every other school in america is like this: the undergrad and the grads live in separate social atmospheres. when i was an undergrad i only ever interacted with grad students through my lab group

do you feel like you miss out on anything though? like maybe some events or opportunities that only undergrads have? in what way specifically does admin "care" about you less? sorry lol i just have trouble understanding how specifically any of this is instantiated in your daily life (besides that you're not going to be welcome in the eating clubs or chilling in the undergraduate residences)

Question about STEM and Language Placement Testing

Hey ya'll! I'm an upcoming student at Princeton intending to do a BSE in MechE. In high school, I took AP Chem, but received a 2 on the exam (oof). I didn't take Physics 2,  Physics C Mechanics, or E&M (school didn't offer), but I took AP Physics 1 and received a 5 (as far as I know, this doesn't matter, but let me know if I'm wrong). I'm hoping to skip out of the chem requirement (chem 201 or 207) and maybe even the physics requirement (physics 103 and 104), and I was wondering if I'm still allowed to do the STEM placement testing for physics (since I didn't take Physics C) and for chem (since I received a 2 on the AP exam). I looked at the website and I still need some clarity since there are quite a few conditions that they mention. 

For chemistry, I used AP credit so not sure how difficult the placement exam is. Would recommend emailing the department head or the chem placement officer (find it through the website), my guess is you should feel very comfortable with the AP chen material.

Here is the original message from their previous post retyped as they deleted it:"The FSI scam that everyone was suggesting was a scam as usual. It was $3500 for two classes during the summer for everyone fucking year. This funding this year, however, was a fucking meme of $350. WTF. Like actually wtf. Why target poor kids. I already don't want to be here and will likely end up like the other two people who offed themselves this past week if I go.

I mean fuck. Why? Am i the asshole here? Yale is giving over $1k for their comparable summer program shit and Stanford, etc are probably much more. So Why? I am in hell."

Let's do a cost breakdown right now of going to Princeton versus Yale for example. Yale's program actually only gives a $250 stipend. The number that they are quoting is reflective of the "summer savings contribution", which Princeton got rid of years ago because it disproportionately affected low-income students.

Beyond this, EFC 0 students at Yale still have to pay $1,600 every year unless, unless they do fsy (which only waives this cost in the first year). On the other hand, Princeton requires zero student contribution for the entirety of the education if you're EFC 0.

A.B vs B.S.E program

"one semester of independent work" is true for COS but not the other BSE majors.

Oh, thanks, I didn't know that. I think that's changed since I graduated.

Bse has no limit on the number of departmental (300+) courses you can take in your major. Bse requires only one semester of independent work, with flexible requirements on the final writeup; ab needs two junior papers and a senior thesis. Bse declares major after year one; ab after year two. 

Distribution requirements are totally different as well; bse requires a handful of humanities courses that can come from almost anywhere, while ab students have a wide variety of distribution courses that need to be satisfied for a well rounded liberal arts education.

Oh, thanks, I didn't know that. I think that's changed since I graduated.

Club sports? Intramurals? Hockey?

I'm an incoming freshman at Princeton. I learned to play ice hockey in high school and got pretty okay at it. I was always just on my school's JV team but I really liked the sport and wanted to continue it in college. Obviously I'm not good enough to play on the actual hockey team but I was wondering if I could still play at a lower level? Is there a women's/co-ed intramural or club team? I know there's a club hockey team, and their Campus Recreation webpage says they take all ability levels, but their website makes it seem like they're pretty high level and a men's team. Also, how time-consuming are club sports/intramurals in general?

Check out rugby! Men’s and women’s club. Two practices a week and Saturday matches. Few new players have ever played before getting to PU.

what about the summer break?  like from May to Sept (freshman to soph transition)

&#x200B;

Where will we keep our things? Can we shift early?

You’ll need to move out for summer break, like either go home or do an internship

I understand but I mean where will we keep our stuff like if I buy a chair and others, where will I keep it during the 3 months summer break? I can't carry everythign acros the state during my internship in california. ESP as an intl student taking everything home isn't an option for me.

I have to move to Princeton in like a week for a summer internship and I still haven't found a place to live! So if you know anybody that's got an empty room this summer, please let me know. I'm clean and friendly and I don't have any pets. 

incoming freshman studying ORFE advice/tips?

hello! i'm heading to pt in the fall (class of '26) and applied as an orfe major. I've always liked math and want to go into finance but i have very little experience with math competitions/cos. 

in high school, i was super business orientated. i made 501c3 and did lots of debate but i'm super nervous i can't handle the level of math. btw i'm taking mv calc and diff eq right now.  

It should be renamed IEOR like all other schools.

Uhm. Cornellian here. Don't fall for this. Someone said the same thing at Cornell a year ago, and about 500 ppl showed up for nothing to happen. It's known as the famous "Duffield Proposal prank"

I only took 126 and 226 and I was fine in those classes with windows, but everything was absolutely geared towards Mac/unix

Are these the only 2 classes that you take in cs as a freshman in AB COS major?

No one is an ab cos major until their third year. 

This was a few moons ago so numbers may have changed cause I'm old af

Disclaimer, I am an ex-cos major and don't have a super deep understanding of what goes on under the hood for a computer. But iirc a lot of class assignments are done from the command line, and the most support is given with unix commands, which is v straightforward on an Apple computer. If you're using Windows/DOS commands, you may be more on your own. Though Windows 10 has pretty good support for running unix shells, it's still a bit confusing for me; this may not be an issue if you have a basic understanding of operating systems lol

(This has also been my experience in classes in other departments with a programming component--there is more support for mac users than windows users)

Sorry? Please correct me if I am wrong but they said that they give no grant for laptop (I'm an intl kid) and I can use that computer initiative loan thing to get a laptop upto 3500 usd.

They don’t give a grant specifically for laptops but your finaid grant is based off a number of factors that can total more than the amount that the uni charges you (ie they include some living expenses like travel and books to some degree in their estimate) The money that is left over after they charge you for the semester stays in your student account (which you can release if you need  and subsequently spend on a laptop if that’s what you deem it best for)

Graduated 2019. In my time, everyone I knew did their work in Linux or macOS. When, for example, COS 333 has you adding features to a Unix program from the 70s a Unix-based OS is just easier. In industry, Macs are dominant as well as developer laptops go so it’s also a simpler transition if your plan is to go into industry.

Introduction to Princeton? (In a summer)

\- I will be staying from June 13th - August 6th.

\- Will be staying in the "Joline" dorms

\- Will be on some kind of meal plan 

I just wanted to consult with you all to see if I could get any "insider" information about Princeton. What are some things that I should totally do before I move out in August? Any tips for the best places to study? Are there any events on the weekend that I should keep my eye out for? In short, what should an 8-week summer intern know about Princeton University?

Astrophysics / Astronomy at Princeton?

I can meet up in person, I’m on campus! I will buy each ticket for $20

What's the difference between upperclassman housing and residential college?

I'm doing an exchange at Princeton next semester. I've been asked to choose between residential college and upperclassman housing. Is there a price difference? Which option do you recommend and why? Is it possible to get access to the kitchen? (PS: I have already read all the information I could find on the Princeton website)

Glad it was helpful! :)

Can I cook for myself at Princeton?

I am doing an exchange at Princeton next semester. I have heard that if one selects upperclassman housing, there might be a kitchen, or not. Since I'm on a diet, I'd like to cook for myself at least half of the time. Is that possible? Also, I've heard about co-opts, how does that work? Can exchange students be part of a co-opt?

Oh nice! How can I join a co-op? Also in addition to the semester cost, do we have to pay for food or do we use this money to purchase food together?

For those with ORFE degrees, how was undergrad? What are your jobs now?

I was a COS major so I can't speak to how the ORFE undergrad experience is, but I asked one of my friends (class of '20) for a general breakdown of the 2020 ORFE class's jobs!

* roughly half of his class is in finance (quant trading, investment banking)

* some "regular" software engineers

I will be in the Princeton area for the summer and was wondering if there were any fun events or activities(intramurals) in the area! I also am turning 21 so any bar recommendations would be great as well.

What do people usually do for their 21st? is it reasonable to try to go to NYC? (my birthday is on a Saturday)

anyone know where/if I can park my car next semester?

Current freshman. I live about 90 minutes away from campus and I go home frequently, anywhere from 2 to 3 times a month. It's super troublesome to take public transport (takes twice as long) and I want to bring my car to princeton so I can drive back. However, I know that it is very rare for princeton to grant parking permits. Does anyone have any advice?

2) enter via Nassau but again I think that gate is always closed

3) park in Lot 8 or on University Place

Just tell the guard that you’re moving out and your room number and building and they’ll give you a temp pass

Whoa, grad students are sharing bedrooms now?

astrophysics major please help. hi. I will be attending Princeton this year as an astrophysics major. is there any advice before starting?

2. Try to find summer research work with one of the astrophysics professors after your freshman year

Freshman year will be hell but that’s okay, don’t be intimidated if you die in physics/math, if you’re starting in PHY105, I strongly encourage you to not drop to PHY103, even if you’re struggling in 105 and think that it would be better to drop down—I ended up staying in it despite struggling very badly, but I was able to pull through and did not regret taking a class that was above my skill level coming into freshman year. I fell in love with physics in that class even tho it killed my GPA. Also go to office hours and study sessions, as the class is impossible without them. Don’t be afraid to drop down in math if you must to survive in physics, math here is not taught great at all and the goal is mainly to survive until you’re finished than to actually learn anything. The hardest part is getting through freshman year, if you can do that, you can do anything!

Difference between "Units of AP" and "Courses Replaced"

I was recently accepted into pt and will be joining the class of '26. I've been studying up on APs but I'm not sure which ones I need to take/give me credit. 

Does anyone know the difference between units of credit vs princeton courses replaced? I got a 5 in AP US History but what does "one unit of AP" give me? I'm considering taking the European history test this Friday but unsure if it means anything? 

btw I'm planning to study in the engineering department. idk if that helps

Yeah to add on to this, for example in engineering for a BSE you need 4 “units of AP” (2 physics, 1 math, 1 chem) to have “advanced standing” and graduate in 3.5 years. I’m guessing similar rules apply to AB students. This is the only way you *reduce* your course load, otherwise “courses replaced” simply means you meet a prerequisite and can start at a higher level (none of these courses in your image meet this, but something like Calculus can “replace” MAT 103 and you can start in MAT 201). Sorry this is math focused but that’s what I’m doing lol

if an AP test has "no equivalent course" under the "courses replaced" column, it means that it does not satisfy any course requirement (i.e. it doesn't take the place of any course). an example of an AP test that _does_ satisfy a requirement is a 5 on AP chemistry, which you can use to replace CHM207 (meaning you don't have to take CHM207 at all).

You may have a hard time finding a job in aerospace engineering. The state schools are the ones with the actual connections to companies where you might want to work. A Princeton degree may be useful at private aerospace companies.

Could be different now, but when I was there it was a big line and you walked in, in line. So the earlier you get in line, the earlier rows you get.

I considered having her stay at a pet hotel, but I feel like that wouldn't be super comfy for her, and I'm not sure if any freshman dorms allow pets. Would the best option be to find someone nearby to take care of her for the first two years before I move out of the dorms, or are there other options?

Here are your options: 

\-Find a family friend to take care of her for two years

Also while some people are very allergic to cats, it doesn't become an issue unless you room with them. I have a cat on campus and it's been fine (note: I also have a single dorm so no roommates)

What are some good study spots on campus that don't require a Princeton ID?

Hey all I just wanted to confirm that after I received a confirmation email after filling out the committing form in the portal that all is good? I don’t have to do anything else right? All the NetID, Princeton Email, and other information will be sent out after May 2nd?

I haven't written a LOCI yet for Princeton since I already submitted an update late February and I haven't really done anything significant since. Do you think it'll hurt my chances of getting off the waitlist? They did mention in the letter that no additional information is required and that everything they need is in my file. Do you think I should still submit one anyways?

I agree with you, but at some point it becomes a cargo cult 😜

From my experience, people who got in off waitlist or after being deferred typically wrote a LOCI

No deposit required for incoming freshmen?

So I committed to Princeton via the form on the applicant portal yesterday (!!!!) but just wanted to double check that Princeton *does not* require a deposit for incoming freshmen. On the reply to admission form it states that "No deposit is required" but I felt I should make sure. Just a bit paranoid as classmates who are going to peer institutions have had to put down deposits at their respective universities.

Premed at Princeton

How’s premed at Princeton? Is it true that it’s unforgiving because of the harsh grading? Also approx what percentage of people actually stay on the pre med track? 

SPIA on pre-med?

So I know it sounds kind of crazy but the HPA website said that public and international affairs are one of the most successful pre-med majors at Princeton and I love policy but am also super interested in medicine and don’t know what route I’ll ultimately choose (law/public sector or medicine). However, I know I have to start working on pre-reqs and was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to accomplish this successfully or just in gen? Also, if I’m invited to FSI and do it, what would make the best secondary course? 

Hi there! While I am a pre-med and politics or anthro major, SPIA isn’t that far off and I considered SPIA for a time so I know what goes into it somewhat.

As far as doing pre-med and SPIA, imo it really isn’t as difficult as some people may have you believe. SPIA pre-recs are only 4 classes, and those classes are either super flexible or are large classes that many students take, so provided you take 1 each semester in freshman and sophomore year, you’d be plenty set to major in it.

The same thinking goes for pre-med. Depending on how you choose to plan your schedule, you’ll be taking 1-2 pre-med classes each semester. The only real downside to doing pre-med and SPIA together (along with any non-natural science major really) is that your choice of electives and taking weird and strange courses is going to be a little thin, because each semester will have you taking 3-4 classes (likely 4 in freshman and sophomore year especially) to meet either major requirements, pre-med classes, or distribution requirements. If you’re fine with that, it’s plenty doable to do those two things while here. If you’re not fine with that, you can always go up to 5 classes in a semester and diversify your semesters a bit more at the cost of more work. It’s really up to you what you feel you can handle.

Aerospace Engineering at Princeton

I’m a recent admit at Princeton and I plan on studying aerospace engineering. I have not committed yet, and that’s cause I’m stuck between UCLA and Princeton.

AFAIK, UCLA’s aerospace program is slightly better and organized with much stronger clubs, but I don’t really know too much about Princeton.

In terms of strictly AE, what school should I can choose? Also, what should I know about AE at Princeton?

Wait, seriously? Even engineering graduates end up in finance or consulting? WTF? That's somewhat shattered my dreams of going there and studying aerospace engineering...

Almost all of the computer science graduates my year ended up on wall Street, despite very aggressive recruiting in the middle of the late 90s dot com boom.

So employers would be attracted to someone with an engineering degree from Princeton, people just choose to go into finance/consulting?

Yeah for sure, Princeton is still great for name recognition for any job, my first comment is just arguing that in applied fields like engineering, domain specific experience > ivy leave name recognition

If you’re undecided between UCLA and Princeton, please go to UCLA and let someone else take your Princeton spot.

This is coming from a pre-frosh commit at Pton who is intent on majoring aerospace and who also got a pretty in-depth look at MAE at Pton.

What school u commit to?

Go to UCLA. If you want to be an engineer, they don't care about the brand name of the school as much (plus, UCLA is equally as prestigious)

Currently deciding whether or not to commit as a molecular biology major (have some other options like Brown and Penn’s dual degree life sciences/management program) so any advice would help a lot.

I didn’t actually get into PLME! But I was accepted to Penn’s dual degree program in Biology and Management @ Wharton.

as a formerly premed student as pton, i would say go for PLME (i was gonna apply to that haha) because it offers you a lot more opportunities. my premed friends at princeton struggle with finding medical internship/volunteer work opportunities and even penn is much better for that bc of the nearby hospitals. as much as i love princeton (sometimes lol) it is not a good place for premed. also our chem classes are not premed oriented at all and will kick u in the ass if ur not very chemistry-oriented. finally, if you enjoy studying things besides math/science, and are even thinking about a non bio/chem major, don’t come to princeton. if ur premed at pton u basically have to be a chem or bio major or risk taking 5 classes every semester and having little work/school life balance. princeton obviously has a great name but doesn’t compare to dual programs or PLME if you know you want to go into medicine.

I’m premed at Princeton. It’s true that classes are hard (but that’s true at any top institution) and the lack of med schools nearby makes it difficult to find clinical volunteering opportunities but it’s not impossible. There’s the Princeton Medical Center, EMT squad, hospice volunteering and more that students can be a part of. 

Edit: also you don’t have to commit to a particular major now. It’s very easy to switch majors in the first 2 years of your Princeton career, so you are not locked in to molecular biology at all.

Damn, do you think I should go to Penn or Brown instead?

Do you feel comfortable sharing which university you’re currently doing your MD/PhD at? If not I  completely understand, I’m just trying to gauge where some of the premeds at Pton end up going for MD/PhD (I’m kinda in the same

Former pre-med at Princeton. grinded through chem major under intent to enter med school. Didn't get much clinical exposure, because Princeton. Now I'm almost done w/ med school and looking at non-clinical jobs because I realized that I hate the hospital lifestyle. In hindsight, having that clinical exposure during undergrad would've definitely helped w/ narrowing down career options during undergrad. I guess I was just following what my friends did; we were all good at science and had aspirations to go into medicine. I'm on the MD/PhD track, way more passionate about research, so at least I have an out.

“A true Renaissance woman, Princeton’s valedictorian has proved herself an extraordinary scholar and research scientist, and has also starred in stage plays and written stories and poetry, all while earning 10 A+’s in courses from six different departments, including English and psychology as well as molecular biology (her concentration) and quantitative and computational biology (her certificate program). At Princeton, A+ grades require written justifications from the professors. Over the course of her four years, Orlovsky earned no grade below an A.”

I wasn’t even aware you COULD get an A+. I get one A and about 3 Cs a semester.

Princeton vs Oxford Computer Science

It’s a small thing, but no student takes five classes *every* semester, even if they’re engineers. 4/8 semesters have to be five classes if I’m not mistaken for BSE students, which can be even less if one participated in summer classes.

... I took four semesters of 5, three semesters of 6, and one semester of 7.  Whatchoo talking 'bout?

Good point, I guess you don’t have to take five every semester (I just opted to). Either way, still more than you’d have at Oxford.

And many of my friends are doing 4 or 5 classes, so 🤷‍♂️

In fact I don’t even think they let you sign up for more than 6 now, so I have to wonder when you were here.

I only know of a single person ever doing 6 classes, and everyone I know agrees she’s unique in that regard.

Hi, congrats! I studied ORFE at Princeton (Class of 2018) and went on to do an MSc in CS at Oxford (+ I spent my junior spring semester at Oxford).

Getting Rescinded

I was recently accepted to the class of 2026. My predicted grades were 99.4/100 (unweighted, I'm from India so we have only 5 subjects and our final transcript consists of our end of year exam marks). 

Princeton or Brown for pre-med?

Pre med at Princeton is hard — took out a couple of my friends. I can’t speak to Brown, but it’s one of the few Princeton tracks that makes me 😬😬

Princeton grad student here, who also got into an M.D/Ph.D program in the past. The only two things that **really** matter for med school admissions (right now) are GPA and MCAT. Average GPAs at Brown historically tend to be higher than at Princeton.

Yeah for sure, it’s a program specifically for URM (Black and Latinx) tho.

That sounds awesome for those students, but my profile is definitely over represented in medicine 😅

I’m deciding between these as well. Brown is def  easier with GPA, but I found Pton had some pretty cool programs with Penn Medicine (one of them is an undergrad research internship program that, if selected as an undergrad, allows you to matriculate to Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine and get your MD upon graduation). If you’re really motivated, premed at Pton should be manageable, and in my opinion, while both are amazing schools, Princeton is a whole other tier.

brown

Princeton is great, and if you like the vibe and opportunities you should come, but I think it’s a tough place to be pre-med. (I’m not, but as a bio major I take the same classes they have to and know a lot of them.)

Ask around and find out what Brown’s orgo and other hard pre-med courses are like - Brown’s pass/fail options will help your GPA, but you can’t do that with orgo etc. Outside of chem and math I don’t find Princeton’s grading that tough, so it really just comes down to those subjects.

AP Statistics

But you *are* planning to take them? Also, out of curiosity, are you an AB or BSE student?

AB, and I'm taking all of the tests I said I would be on my application (except for AP Lit). I'm fairly confident I can pass most of them with little/no studying, though.

Gonna have to go back and check application. Don’t recall the part where it asked about this. Thanks. Also, by “pass” do you mean a 3?

You didn't have to tell them, but if you reported AP scores it let you report tests you were planning on taking (just putting down the test without a score next to it). By passing I mean a 3. I was able to pull off 4 tests that I did no studying for with 4's and 5's, so I feel pretty good about this year.

Not a single one of my AP exams this year means anything. The only one that could potentially get me credit is Physics C (mechanics only), but I can't get credit for that one because I'm not taking the E&M exam. I'm not studying for any of my exams and hoping that Princeton won't rescind my admission if I fail a few of them lmao

Princeton or UPenn?

First off, I just want to say that I'm incredibly lucky to have gotten into both schools and to be in this position. But right now, I'm having the hardest time deciding between the two schools. I'm thinking about going pre-med and pursuing a degree in the STEM field. Princeton's better for the program that I'm looking into, but I'm really worried about the grade deflation here. On the other hand, Penn has one of the best pre-med programs in the country. What do you guys think?

[deleted]

[deleted]

Princeton ended grade deflation in 2014.

Normalized for size, Princeton has more graduates attending top medical schools, although this also has to do with self selection. Penn probably has more in absolute numbers because Penn has nearly twice as many undergrads (2400 vs 1300 per class).

Medical school prestige doesn't really matter, at least not nearly as much as law school/MBA/PhD prestige in terms of career opportunities.

I'm a Princeton grad doing my PhD at MIT.

Princeton grades deflation is tough comparing to other top colleges. Health professional  (HPA) at Princeton is the best in helping you preparing your premed track.

Botany class?

Is there a basic botany class at Princeton, perhaps with a field component? I’ve looked around the course catalog a bit and can’t find any, which surprised me.

Currently looking into majoring in urban planning, I've also got some strong interests in game design and music composition. Is princeton a good place to learn urban planning while also upholding my other interests? I only have really cursory CS knowledge... is Princeton conducive to learning other things way outside your major? (For example taking classes to further my trombone playing and composition skills and learning about game design while also being an urban planning major?)

The closest to that that Princeton has is the Architecture major alongside the Urban Studies certificate.

Seeking Stool Donor for medical procedure

Mid-30s NJ resident here, posting in this sub because college-age donors are ideal for this procedure. Apologies if this post breaks any sub rules. 

It's gross, but not as gross as being sick for the rest of my life would be, so I'm trying to have a sense of humor about it. This procedure is approved, and is highly effective for treatment of C. Difficile infection, but so far it has not been approved for any other indication despite promising research so my doctor unfortunately can't be involved.

Not certain it’s unique but I have never heard of another college that will fully fund a gap year in another country for its students. If the Bridge program isn’t unique, it’s certainly very unusual.

Crap ton of funding available for undergrads. There were very few things that I had to pay for (on top of tuition, of course, though even then I was on the then-median amount of financial aid) as part of my Princeton experience, even including substantial travel. ( /u/LazyCondition0's comment re: Novogratz Bridge Year Program is a particularly good case of this).

A huge reason I chose Princeton was the SPIA undergraduate major.

Spend some time hanging out at them, get upperclassmen friends to take you to theirs and try the food, and consider location and amenities. Then consider whether you’d want to bicker (and decide if you’re ok with whatever stereotypes there are about the club). Ultimately, the most important thing is you like the people, so do what most of your friends do or join a club that already has friends in the year above you.

Princeton Undergrad Engineering Questions

I am intending to major in mechanical engineering with a minor or certificate in sustainability or/and robotics. I have a few questions about engineering at Princeton.

What machine shops and makerspaces are available to students?

What are median grades like in intro courses?

What is the workload like? Do people still have lives outside of school?

Thanks! For reference, other options are uc Berkeley, Ucla, northwestern, Hopkins, Dartmouth, washu, and Umich.

The workload is pretty tough for some of the intro MAE courses and first year courses. I strongly suggest taking the engineering math/physics requirements and not PHY 103/104 and MAT 201/202. Most people take the PHY and MAT ones since they fulfill the same requirements as the engineering ones, but they're poorly taught IMO and they focus too much on theory (which engineers don't care about).

>As to the real-world applicability of courses and career preparedness, know this: Princeton does not focus the program to training engineers at all. The focus is training engineering professors. A huge percentage go straight to ph.ds. There are tons of opportunities for research, fewer for co-ops. Most professors spend their entire career in academia, not industry. I'm in the minority of my class as someone who actually works in the mechanical engineering industry.

Anyone know what textbook MAT 215 uses?

According to princetoncourses.com, it uses understanding analysis by stephen abbott, which is the same book my roommate is currently using. I think i remember him mentioning a good preview of the class can be achieved after completing the third pset?

W/ All due respect, this was a post about the course's book(s). This post did not ask for your opinions on my career track or concentration preference. Please don't take others down or give unwarranted, biased advice, and maybe try to not project your failures/shortcomings onto others. Princeton has one of the best (if not the best) Math departments. It has tons of resources to support its students, both majors and non-majors alike. Just because *you* had a bad experience in the class or the math department as a whole does not mean you have to fight futilely against a tidal wave of statistics, accolades, and world-renowned faculty that prove the Princeton Math Department is one of the top-notch departments at the university and around the world. Be better.

From my perspective, I was under-prepared for MAT 215. Despite having the usual 5 in AP Calc BC / Statistics, I had almost no exposure to proof-based courses, and didn't last long in the major. My academic advisor was completely oblivious to this dynamic and generally useless. The experience more or less killed my passion for math.

As part of a consulting project, my team is currently collecting data by surveying and interviewing dozens of college students across the country in order to better understand student preference, sentiment, and behavior towards innovation in financial services (e.g. app-based brokerages, digital banking, etc). In an effort to further a student initiative, I kindly ask for your collaboration by filling out this quick 3 minute [survey](https://forms.gle/uyvv2bt9V4qaBhdh9)! Also, please indicate that Marden referred you to this survey.

I’ve been accepted to Princeton and Penn’s Life Sciences and Management dual degree program, and I really don’t want to lose out on that healthcare management aspect if I end up choosing Princeton. I currently can’t find any certificate program in healthcare management; is it possible to create one unique to my goals? I know at some schools you can create your own concentrations and such so that’s what I asked.

Do they have classes in healthcare management at Princeton? I personally believe that minors (basically what certificates are), are useless because at the end of the day they’re just more courses requirements. You should just take the courses you want to take. If getting a minor requires you to take course A, B, C, and D, but you don’t want to take course D, just don’t take course D.. the only thing you miss out on is not having the minor on your diploma, but you can still list coursework on your resume and you’ll also have all the knowledge. Basically, find out if Princeton offers the courses you want to take related to healthcare management and don’t worry about the  formality of getting a certificate.

I do think there’s a way to create your own major / certificate at Princeton but TheChimeras is spot on to point out that the content itself of healthcare mgmt isn’t available at Princeton so you wouldn’t be able to “create” that certificate by stringing together courses.

If you’re really torn, you can DM me. I went to Princeton and my wife studied healthcare mgmt at Penn.

No. But I wouldn’t not go to Princeton because of a management undergrad. You can always pick up a one year health management degree afterwards.

no. princeton has no med school. if u want to go to med school don't come here

Princeton has some courses in health policy and some courses in business-adjacent things that are vaguely management-like, but not many offerings in healthcare management that I’m aware of (since we don’t have a business or med school). Look at registrar.Princeton.edu/course-offerings and see if there are enough relevant courses in the first place

is it possible to do research in the summer before freshman year?

I plan to major in molecular biology at Princeton in the fall and am currently interested in doing some research over the summer. Do you think it would be possible to get in contact with faculty and see if there are any opportunities available over the summer? I only live about 15 minutes away from campus.

you would have to email the professors to ask but I don’t see why not. I would recommend spending this summer just chilling/hanging out with friends though so you don’t feel burnt out before school even starts!

Princeton vs. Cornell Engineering

Both will teach you what you need to know and get you jobs/positions. Imo you should decide based on the big differences between the schools outside engineering (size, location, social scene, academic setup, etc.)

Any discord groups of Princeton students(computer science/math/physics/filming)?

Is it possible to complete a bs in comp sci and then do a masters in stats in 5 yrs?

Or does the bs/ms program require that both degrees be in the same major? Thanks!

Do you happen to know which “certain engineering departments” are?

If I remember correctly the only engineering departments who did _not_ continue their MEng programs were COS and ORF(?). Though I know COS offers an MSE degree that a lot of people can do in a year

Princeton is starting to offer 5-year undergrad+master degrees for certain engineering departments, but not in different fields. Also, Princeton does not have a BS degree (only BSE), and afaik does not offer a masters in stats.

Submitting only IGCSE and A level grades?

Not sure if this helps, but my school submitted both the IGCSE grades and the internal grades on the same transcript, as well as my IB predicted grades

I'm from the UK, so I submitted my GCSEs and my A levels predicted grades (which were basically the same as my summer end of year 12 exams). Then I submitted my A level mock grades for midterm grades. Honestly, I don't think they're that fussed though, submit what makes you look good (for example predicted grades are likely to be a grade higher than your actual year 12 summer grades, at least in my school they are)

How long does the “holy crap I got into Princeton” high last?

I’m like in a constant state of feeling thankful after such a stressful college app season

My 25th reunion is coming up... I'll let you know if that feeling fades :)

Loll true but I don’t know I’ve seen people say they felt this way their entire 4 years 😂

Not long, I’d assume. Also prefrosh here, but I’m sure it completely fades once midterms roll around😂

I’m ten years out, and when I interview tons of qualified applicants and few/none of them get in, I am reminded of the “holy cramp I got into Princeton” every time. Not sure it goes away ever!

I’m a freshman but sometimes I definitely still feel it lol.

Loll true but I don’t know I’ve seen people say they felt this way their entire 4 years 😂
