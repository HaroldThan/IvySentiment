Chance Me! and Prospective Student Q&A

Please place all admissions related posts here, in the form of comments, and current Cornell students will reply. Try to be detailed; if we don't have enough information, we can't help. Also, if you are a prospective student, and have questions about life at Cornell, feel free to post them here!



Y'all.



If you're posting here, you most likely have the stats to get into practically any university.



At some point, factors out of your control determine your acceptance or rejection.



Welcome to the shit-show that is the higher education admissions lottery.

Typical Cornell CS student profile. Your chances are very good.

Kinda shitty EC’s and rlly good essays 

Depending on ED size and how unique/good ur essays r I’d say ~50% chance

4.3 GPA weighted, 1550 SAT  

10 APs taken, AP scholar with distinction  

Awards: National Merit Semifinalist, RIT Computing Award (although Idk if that'd be significant for other colleges)  

ECs:  

in school - National Honors Society President (this year), Student Council Rep (for 4 years), DEI representative (2 years), School Council elected member (this year)  

Essays:  

Would appreciate any feedback, thank you so much :)

Yes! Upload them :) Anything that will give you an edge to your app and your gut tells you to do it, do it

I would not. An admissions officer doesn't want to read your academic paper.

Ok yea the school responded and said they do thx.

For supplemental materials, does Cornell accept uploading research abstracts/excerpts from research papers?

Hola friends 👋. Chance a rising senior for admission to the class of 2027



**Demographics:** Indigenous male, household income ~$200k/yr, large urban public



**Stats:** 4.00 GPA UW (no W GPA or class rank), 1560 SAT (760/800), 4 5s on AP exams





**Extracurriculars:**



- founder, manager positions in club and local initiative focused on applied math/data science research



- MIT PRIMES Circle and one of SSP/Simons/BU RISE: learned computational math and applications, used for a paper and research poster



- two instruments with multiple ensembles for performance, volunteering, etc.



- have hiked approx. 60 trails, 30 Adirondack high peaks



 - instructor in competitive math for middle school students



- small stuff



- research at a HYPSM research group (expected, from cold email lol)



**Awards:** 2 ~$500 prizes for research, local music stuff, collegeboard stuff





Thanks for your time and **have a great day!** 🙌🙌🙌

Since I don't know if anyone answered this for you I'd say that more than a couple Cs or a D/F is probably when you'd encounter a problem. However, be aware that the university will contact you first to ask what caused your grades to drop like that, so you might be able to make a case for yourself regardless of what your grades look like by the end of the academic year

Congrats! Did you get in as First-year or transfer student?

BRO I ALSO GOT EARLY ADMISSION TO SHA! SEE YOU THERE!!

Early acceptance letter into SHA

First year! Senior in HS rn. Thanks!!!

Congrats!

Cornell admits by school, not by major. If you are a NY resident and apply to a statutory college (CALS, HumEc, ILR), you will have a better chance of admission.



thank you! That's what I thought but should I have some bio/ag-related extracurricularar to relate to the college (which I don't)?

No clue. Write about your own interests. Don't make up stuff that you aren't truly passionate about.

Can anyone compare the Biometry Statistics major and Statistical Science majors? For NY residents, which has easier admission? No particular bio-related experience but good statistical-related EC. Thank you!

Some things of note:

Yeah, I knew that about the legacy, and that’s a shame about APUSH, but at least they’ll still see I did well on the exam. Thanks!

Hi! I have a 1560 SAT, a 5 on APUSH (have taken/taking 4/6 available APs), and am a National Merit Semifinalist. My ECs are very focused in politics, but no national competitions or research. I applied to CALS for Biometry and Statistics. My personal statement was pretty solid and everyone I showed it to loved it. My supplemental essay was good, but nothing outstanding. I’m a legacy, but applied RD. What are my chances?

uh oh my cool format didn’t work out but I hope this makes sense LMAO

I don’t know much about double majoring, but I also got into CS at GT last year and at an info session, they made it sound like it’s difficult to take many classes outside your major due to a pretty rigid curriculum. That was a huge turn off for me and considering that you’re thinking of double majoring, it might be for you as well. Definitely go to an info session at both schools if you’re able to!

Source: CALS transfer from Tech

My 2nd choices were either Colorado State or UC Davis. I chose Cornell because it is the top in Animal Science and they offered good financial aid. I honestly didn't know that much about it before coming here and I wasn't certain about my choice up until the moment I accepted my spot here.

What was your "2nd choice" uni?



...and why did you end up choosing Cornell instead of them?

I transferred here and I recall being able to submit only one letter of recommendation, so determine who you think wrote the best one. Also, it should be one of the three your professors wrote.



GPA is fine. It's not going to detract from your application.



In my opinion, the most important part of the transfer application is the "why do you want to transfer to Cornell?" essay. This profile you've posted here doesn't mean much. If you don't have legitimate reasons to apply to Cornell specifically you'll get rejected no matter what your stats look like at any of Cornell's colleges.  With that said, I think you can make a good case for wanting to come to Cornell for its many research opportunities, given your prior experience.

JUNIOR TRANSFER:



-3.89 GPA





-started music club, work as a tutor, 300 hours of biochemistry research, interning in chemistry lab for fortune 500 company





-4 good letters from professors and supervisor

Decent chance, where r u transferring from? Also with a cool story like that I’d say it helps you out even more

I'm transferring from a small community college in rural Virginia. Surprised so many credits would transfer over. Nobody in my family holds a college degree. Will these factors hurt my chances? I hear legacy students have the highest chance of admission..

Not really. Legacy helps but it’s not huge. I would really explore your passions In your essay, I’d be happy to read it over if it helps but I’m just a freshmen in ILR



Tbh idk how many older students they take but I wouldn’t worry about legacy too much. Plenty of non legacy students get admitted, especially to ilr. 



Good luck!

Hi, all!

ILR transfer prospect here. I have 26 credits and will be taking 6 credits in the spring and was assured by Ian that all but one class would transfer. I have a 3.85 GPA while working full time in a warehouse. Ample experience in this environment. Really where my heart lies, and I'd like to do more. ILR is the perfect fit. What are my chances? I'm nearly 30 years old and did poorly in high school because I simply did not care to apply myself. Poor home life growing up and was severely depressed, but I've since turned a new leaf. Passionate about blue collar labor and have a desire to learn how to positively impact the field I've come to love.

Materials can be submitted late, as long as they are received by January 10th.



https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/

This isnt really a chance me but more of a: am i screwed on a technicality? question. 



I submitted my commonapp earlier today with everything good,  except for the fact one out of two teachers did not ever submit their letter of recommendation. Cornell's website seems pretty strict on the issue. Is there anyway i can get an extension to get this letter of recommendation?





For the record i asked this teacher for my letter of rec in may, and followed up in September and november.



Edit: she submitted it today so happily ill be able to apply. Love your school btw

To the best of my knowledge, you can minor in any available minor, no matter the school you are in and it is in. I have no idea if a dance minor exists, but you can google it.

Yes I am doing this exact thing, totally possible

SO COOL OF YOU :O

It's a bit easier to get into CALS instate compared to oos. Being an international still puts you at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to domestic students even if you don't need financial aid. However, it mostly depends on where you go to school.

Thank you for the reply! I was worried because some people say I need to halve the general acceptance rate to get the acceptance rate for international student. Would it be that hard for international students not requiring financial aid or will it be slightly less if I don't ask for the financial aid?

Thank you so much for the help!

Hi, former TO here!



It is mainly for new activities but you can also put any significant activities you did since you last submitted your application to Cornell

Thank You for your response! I am happy to see you again here. How are you liking Cornell?

Pretty good, the weather is crazy tho 😅



I read something about roughly 20% of transfer students were from CC in recent years. Looks like they don't put much weight into where transfers come from, so long as they fit in with the culture. I'm a fellow transfer applicant! Good luck :)



How should I approach the personal statement essay for Cornell as a CC transfer? To be exact, I'm referring to this question:  

The personal statement helps colleges get to know you better as a person and a student. Please provide a 1,250-3,250 character statement discussing your educational path (approx. 250 - 650 words). How does continuing your education at a new institution help you achieve your future goals?  

Would love to hear everyone's thoughts!

Ugh I’ve been searching for this info! Thank you!

It’s a very good accomplishment. I think the acceptance rate is 20% maybe even lower (this year).

Is getting accepted to Nolan a big deal or not? I see basically everyone who applied to Nolan getting accepted, including me LOL. Congrats Everyone!

Try to find someone at your current school who handles transferring and can give you advice on what to do to prepare as best as possible for applying to Cornell. You can look at cornell’s econ page and find what courses they recommend you should take before transferring too, based on your year in college (at least CALS has this on their webpage). Cornell should also have many resources online with tips on how to prepare to apply as a transfer. Make sure you write a nice essay and get a good reference letter too, and maybe try to buff up your extracurriculars too if you think you are lacking.

This is called a likely letter. I received one that said almost exactly that, but not from diversity outreach. They probably are writing yours because you add diversity to Cornell in some way they really liked. It's them letting you know that you are accepted, but Cornell can't officially tell you that until Ivy Day because that is the contract the Ivies make with each other. Likely letters are a way around that. Congratulations and welcome!

Congrats 🎉🎊🎈

Thank you so much!

Will try to be as genuine as possible here. I am currently a senior who has an extra semester left because of COVID. Not exaggerating when I say that it is the best of times and the worst of times here. The weather is ass for more than half of the school year and seasonal depression gets real when we don’t see the sun for weeks. If you’re not from the northeast like me, make sure you really prepare with a good quality winter coat (there are reasonably priced ones plz don’t get a Canada goose 😭) and boots etc. ofc it depends some on your major, but overall the academics are very rigorous here and once your first exam of the semester passes by they just keep on coming until you graduate… time management is key and if you are accustomed to being at the top of your class in high school, like most of us were, prepare to get reality checked. 



Like any other school, finding your place at Cornell is essential and will make or break your experience. I almost dropped out twice (hence the leave of absence) but am still here because of the connections I’ve made with people and communities at Cornell. I wouldn’t give these relationships up for the world. My best advice is to immerse yourself in whatever clubs/activities you can that suite your interests and try to be as social as possible even though it seems like the most daunting thing when you first arrive on campus. Opting for a roommate(s) when you select a dorm situation is not only cheaper but will help you make friends in the long run. Work/life balance is the greatest challenge for all of us but it is the life connections I’ve made that convinced me to stay here.

Aside from it being hard for me to move away from home, I love Cornell and am generally very happy here. There is so much nature which was a college necessity for me, but also do many amazing buildings and places to explore, on top of all the opportunities here. The reddit unfortunately becomes a place to complain and ask questions, so it can be off putting, I remember thinking the same. Don't let it scare you.

Cornell was a waste of my time and a mistake I regret. 



A name is not everything

dont trust reddit. most people here are loners or depressed or both. ive had a fantastic time here despite the ups and downs.

Thank you so much for replying! Cornell still seems a bit scary but you make it seem way more doable. I'll continue considering it.



Are you guys generally happy or do you regret going to Cornell?

Accepted into Grad school at Cornell- are they good at providing financial aid? And what are some good opportunities ? Thanks !

Honestly Cornell is what you make of it. Don't stress yourself out  too much or put too much pressure on yourself and you'll do just fine. The weather here is very strange but on the days that there is sun, Cornell transforms into a beautiful place. Everyone starts to socialize more, people will relax on the lawns and play games. I find these days so beautiful. There are going to be hard days and there are going to be good. For me the good parts of Cornell are the times I spend with my friends. Those times where we are just sitting together and studying or playing games in our dorms. Everyone here is very motivated to do good and there are those who are super competitive. If you come here and give it some time you will find where you belong.

What’s so great about Cornell? I’ve heard really good things about the Ivy League, but I have no idea what to expect from it.

You definitely got this. Incredible work you have done. Don’t stress.

Hello everyone I’m a Prospective transfer:



Just wondering if anyone can provide insight on the shift from community college to Cornell. How much harder are the classes? I’m Going in as a CAS government major so how big will the classes be? Any insight greatly appreciated thank you.

I was accepted off the waitlist on the 4th.

if your math/science background isn’t super strong, i highly recommend you brush up on some basic chem and calc 1. i’m a current freshman and while i was okay with chem 2090 because i have a stronger chem background, my math background is pretty bad and i wish someone would’ve told me to just relook at some basic calc. also if you can, just take the summer off and chill. i worked crazy hours throughout the summer and i never got a true break, which reflected in my studies this semester. you did all the hard work; relax and enjoy one of your last summers!

Yes. Usually the rule is that double majors must be in the same college, but minors can be across colleges. Do double check with the relevant schools and departments websites as there are sometimes caveats.

In that sense, do CALS and DYSON count as the "same college" that one can double major in?



https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/major-changes-and-double-major



[2] https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/double-major/

~~I would assume so given this notice:~~



~~"Note: While meeting or exceeding the above criteria will increase your competitiveness, it does not ensure approval to double major in AEM."~~







CAS website: "If you decide to add another major, it must be within the College of Arts & Sciences"



Application straight into the garbage. /s



Come on, stop worrying about it. You are fine.

aight

Thanks! Do you know anyone who has done this?

No, but if you search the subreddit for "internal transfer" you will find many posts on the topic.

cool, thanks again

Wow, thanks for the info. Merry Christmas!

Ok yeah i will, but also i just felt like if i indicated interest on my app they might take that into consideration and maybe it would be a positive



If you are more interested in data science, I would say ORIE is probably more applied and has more of the data science aspect. Other than that, CAS has more liberal arts requirements and a language requirement, while COE has more science and math classes in its core curriculum.

I am very confused between your posts. Are you currently a junior or a senior?



If you are a senior, I am greatly confused and you would need to prove extenuating circumstances to Cornell about your high school mathematics curriculum...





yeah i think cornell in washington is a big thing for gov majors

its also moreso what you actually want to do...don't apply to a&s just cause you think thats easier, instead think about what you want to learn outside of the major. doing psych in a&s will mean that you are taking things like language, quantitative reasoning, and overall just more hollistic ed. While hum dev is centered on the dynamics of the human race--and while both departments have a lot of overlap, you cant double major in them anyways, and only a certain amount of out-of-school credits will even count towards your major. gl

hi! I read that cornell's psych and human dev departments merged so I'm very conflicted now, should I just apply to humec instead of A&S because of the slightly higher acceptance rate? I don't see why I would need to apply to A&S because all courses would be available to me in the super-department. Any psych majors please lmk any insight!

I thiught they did, but at half the credit



Here is the CALS policy: https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/non-cornell-credit/college-credit-earned-while-high-school

LOCI is submitted on the portal. There should be an upload spot specifically for it.

In the upload portal, there is a spot for Optional Supplemental Material. Should I submit it there?

Yup!

Where should I submit the LOCI for Cornell? I can't find an AO for my region (International Asian btw). Should I just upload it via the portal?

Honestly, I think you know you have a shot. Most applicants are very qualified, but not everyone can get in. At this point, it’s less about how qualified you are, and more about the fit; both Cornell as a fit for you, and you as a fit for Cornell. Good luck!

Let me know when you get in (sadly my opinon doesn't count tho... im an applicant this year too).

Thank you!

“When” I get in. Haha—thanks for the positivity!

Can someone chance me, please? I applied RD and am so nervous for the 31st.

I have a decent amount of political/government ECs, but no major competitions. I did Boys State, political campaign canvassing, am class treasurer, and represented my school at a youth conference. I am also an officer in my school’s multicultural club and a member on the mock trial team and environmental club. My other activities include math tutoring, a job, local volunteering, and varsity tennis. 





My personal statement was also really solid, I’d like to think. One of my colleges sent me a letter saying it was one of the best they had read all year. 



So with that information, do any current students think I have a shot? Thanks!

Check the weather for when you’re going to be here. Then, pack for 15 degrees above and below. Bring layers so you don’t need to bring a heavy jacket if it gets cold. Bring super comfortable shoes, you will be walking a LOT!

I'm not a student, but I'm from the northeast, and I have to second that layers are your best friend here! Bring a bag to carry water and extra layers with you, it's much better than tying things around your waist or over your shoulder. The weather often contradicts itself, too, as it can change quickly- hence the saying "If you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes.". Especially in spring, it may feel hot in the sun (especially if you wear dark clothing), but freezing cold when a cloud or breeze passes by.

Keep in mind that transferring isn't easy. Most transfers are TOs (basically Cornell's 1-year-delayed-acceptance).

I know transferring is hard, especially for A&S

Transfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.

ohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?

its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set up





  

  



  

  



  

As a fellow highschool science fair presenter, congrats on that first place at your regional fair! You should be proud of yourself :)

~ My ECs are being president of science national honor society, getting third place in regional science fair junior year, getting first place in regional science fair my senior year, treasurer of the marine conservation club, tutoring since the 9th grade, and helping take care of the marine lab at my school.

~ My personal essay was about how the suburbanization of the area around my home led to me finding my passion about environmental science.

~ My why CALS essay was about how coming from a small town I had a fondness for Cornell’s diversity and how I admired and wanted to contribute to research project like Professor Wrege’s Elephant Listening Project!

Thank you so much! 

~

Anyone have any idea when TO decisions come out? I know they said Mid-April but around when (based on previous years). Also, how likely is a TO acceptance if all requirements are met?

I started going track my sophomore year of hs! I only did cross country my junior and senior year! Absolutely loved track/xc (despite my number of injuries) and I met some great friends. I encourage you to do extracurriculars that YOU care about and not ones soley the basis of impressing a college. This is exactly what I did in hs and I was admitted this year in the rd round to CALS at Cornell. Good luck!







Also I’m not one hundred percent sure if I am allowed to post this on the thread or not. If not just let me know and I can take it down.

It looks like there are  two with that last name - Robert and Jon. Here are their webpages at Cornell with their emails



https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/



https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/

Waitlisted student here! If it’s not too weird, can someone please provide me with Prof. Kleinberg’s (CS Dept.) email? Would really appreciate it.









question about college life at Cornell! 



Hi everyone. I was waitlisted but the other day I got an email requesting a 250 word essay on why BS-ISST. Does Cornell send this request to all that were waitlisted? Anyone else get this? Thx.

I have a 98.50% GPA





Lmao... i submitted 2 days ago





Thanks in advance.

sorry for posting this again, but anyone gotten off CALS waitlist yet?

Gpa and sat score don’t matter as much as you think. There are a lot of people who apply with the same stats. The admissions officers are not going to be like “Hmmm, this kid got a 1510 and this kid only got a 1500. I’m gonna take the 1510 kid”. They look at the essay to decide. They want someone who will add to the community, not someone who holes up in their dorm reading doing test prep all day.

When I got accepted last year, I don’t think I got anything in the mail. We did get an online code for a free class of 2025 t-shirt though!

When did you get that? I believe we haven’t received one yet.

Do the people who got accepted ED get a letter in the mail or goodies? If so, when?

Not international but for your ECs they don't have to relate at all to your career. Do whatever you like and that's all that matters. Cornell has hundreds of clubs and the people in them come from all kinds of majors.

Alright, a general question. Those have you who have applied internationally, what were you ECs? And should our ECs be related to our career path?

For a regular action applicant trying to major in Biology, is there any portal astrology stuff I can look into?

How many APs we need to write for Cornell and Ivy League. It is a dream to join an Ivy League college.

I hope this is a joke. Burn please.

really good profile

The latter, but you are allowed to submit materials late, as long as it is received by January 10th.



https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/

Hi, I'm asking for a friend cause she's not on Reddit, but do these materials include Cornell's Supplement?

Probably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.



Hi! I submitted my application for Human Ecology a few days ago as a prospective DEA student and was wondering if anyone here could tell me a little bit more about the actual experience of the major, like how many people are in it, interactions with professors, studios, etc. Ik a lot of general facts through my research for my application, but it would help a lot to hear about real experiences from DEA students!

Current SHA soph here. I sort of did the same thing when I applied. I couldn't decide between AEM and A&S and so I applied to SHA for fun also I saw the low acceptance rate at AEM and so I leaned into my host job and got in. The reason the major can be boring is only because it is so broad. Yes, the hotel administration major is broad. Idk ur exact interests but I like finance and so i find stuff like food management boring. but maybe u dont! It is unlikely someone loves finance, financial accounting, food management, and hospitality development. (ps i heard a rumor they arent making all the classes mandatory but instead optional with different tracks in like a couple years) Luckily, the classes are not usually that much of a grind so u can just focus on other stuff when they are boring. The major has a fair bit of elective space so u can just load up on other stuff u like. Another good thing is that the connections are rly rly good especially in hospitality and u arent locking urself into the industry whatsoever. I know a lot of hotelies that put business administration on their resume and no one thinks twice about it. u can check the employment stats but a lot of hotelies dont go into hospitality  (9% only) and instead just do finance (26%) or real estate (26%). the real estate is top of the line here. imo one of the best places to become a real estate analyst. the business dress fridays is called deans distinguished lecture series and its a 1 semester core course, so its not like a regular thing except maybe for a seldom presentation. its not that professional. hotelies are known for being pretty chill imo. im always willing to help out. ur other questions are a bit harder for me to answer but ill do my best. Ithaca is a super unique town so i think it should be a sizable consideration for ur college pick. super cool scenery and isolated i would say. although, the airport is quite nice just doesnt have a ton of flights. the depression meme is a person by person case i would say. there is a big greek life culture especially as part of the biz school. there are also plenty of people who avoid that kinda stuff (me). u can def have ur choice at that here. at least at sha, i would say people are generally happy. the professors at sha are for the most part phenomenal and caring. lastly, congrats! I knew a lot of very qualified people who did not get it, so i wouldnt even consider it an easy path

im free to talk more anytime if u wanna, just dm me :)

Congrats 🎉🎊.

Who are you friends with!? Omg I feel like I got the least sleep in my life during undergrad - in the best way.

Thanks

Ask what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.



How are Cornell as a college and Ithaca as a town though? Is the depression as bad as they say it is? If so, I’m gonna steer clear. Big on parties outside of Greek or do people lean more towards studying/not drinking in their free time? Do students feel happy while going to school and doing their work or sad and stressed most of the time? Ithaca seems cool; I’ll probably visit some time this month. Any other thoughts on campus life/social scene/culture?

Applying undecided doesn't give you an easier change of transferring. As the other comment says, applying to Arts & Sciences is a good move because their whole things is allowing people to have a diverse education. So you could talk in your essay about how you have all these interests you have build up and want to continue (if you do) while still pursing a STEM education. 





Hello!



I'm a rising senior and Cornell is definitely one of the schools I'm considering to apply to during the fall. The problem is .. after 17 years of my life believing I'm want to go into law (major in poli-sci, get into law school, you know how it goes) .. I found that I have a higher affinity dedicated to math and STEM.







Thank you!



1140 sat (superscore) 



extracurriculars: sex (with men)



APs: APES (now you really know im gay), AP Human Geography, AP Seminar, AP Research, AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism (skipped mechanics like a boss)





btw im legacy (3 generations)

Can anyone at cornell please read my ilr essay? Would be appreciated



-Columbia is a big name for a reason, but its not engineering.



-Cornell's engineering, at least the MAE department (and probably others!), is wonderful. The classes are fantastic, they push you, they are interesting, the department/faculty CARE about you as an individual, and there are many choices for courses. None of those things could be said for my friend's experience at columbia.



-Columbia is in NYC, cornell is not. My friend very much enjoys living with friends in NYC and had MUCH more time to enjoy himself and have a real life outside of class than I did in ithaca. I seem to be getting better prepared for career recruiting/work after school right now as a result of this.





Id pick cornell engineering > columbia engineering any day. Hope this helps a bit.

? If you’re talking about the thanksgiving dinner at RPCC then no. It’s just thanksgiving-style dining hall experience.

I am curious about Cornell's thanksgiving dinner. Are there any interesting activities during the dinner?

How selective is that program at MIT? That could make a huge difference

Good enough to certainly apply

Anything to improve?

Also, will USESO be impressive? I was a finalist

It is discernable that your spike aligns with neuroscience more than humanities. Again, your chances very much depend on the prestige of all your activities. Where were those research papers published? What professors did you work with? What organisations recognize your app? That kind of stuff can make the difference between Stanford and Georgia Tech

Hi! I don’t think one or the other is better. Its just what you want to go into. Either way you can apply to minor in the other. I would look at the classes and talk to current students to figure out which vibe fits you better. Your stats seem good but those wont be the standout thing so definitely figure out which supplemental essay feels like a closer fit. Best of luck!

Guys would I be better off applying to Dyson or CS?

DEI OPPORTUNITIES AT CORNELL:



Hello!  

I'm looking to apply to Cornell for fall 2022 admission. I'd like to know more about DEI opportunities at Cornell from a current student. Please comment if you would be able to chat with me about this! Thanks! :)

Yes, but keep in mind that for the first two years, most of your college resources will be dominated by the college you're primarily in, regardless of whether you intend to double major or not.

Hey everyone! I'm going to be applying to Cornell and I'm confused about the intersection between CALS and Dyson. To offer a little context I'm a high school senior who's very interested in food systems and sustainability as well as business and economics. So the schools that are most appealing to me are CALS and Dyson. I know that if I'm accepted into Dyson, it's quite simple to do a double major in CALS, but if I get accepted into CALS, is it relatively easy to do a double major in Dyson?  

I'm really worried because I don't want to apply to either Dyson or CALS and then screw myself over by having to sacrifice either of my interests.  

1. See this commend thread:

 https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/rhe8jn/chance_me_and_prospective_student_qa/hponq79





 https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/ba-information-science-college-arts-sciences/degree-requirements-0-1

Ah thanks, didn't know! Bowers CIS can be confusing.



For more information, see the Degree Requirements pages for:

> this stupid class I don't really care about.



honestly i'm a little perplexed by this comment considering you want to be a biometry major.. you realize that's a lot of statistics right?

fair. i feel like infosci and biometry are similar enough majors in terms of learning outcomes, and if you have already fulfilled most of the requirements then you'll have more room in your schedule to take bio classes - good luck!





https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/admissions/





https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-requirements/distribution/

You only need to satisfy distribution requirements of which there are many classes that might satisfy the same distribution requirement, Cornell is quite flexible. I’m not a bio person either but there are a number of easy bio classes here as well that satisfy bio requirements (we have a bio requirement in CAS as well)

I very much doubt you would have any issues there

Hello!



It is not a deal breaker.



Gce AS-level exam results:

Physics - A

CS - A

Psychology - A

Mathematics - A



I've noticed one of the listed requirements for undergrad admission at Cornell's school of engineering is at least 1 unit of chemistry...



Now, I've never touched chemistry once, not even in grade 10 and below.





Thanks in advance.

Seems like consideration for Milstein happens after RD release, so I would assume it does not have a bearing on admissions.





But do make sure to consider this quote from the program site:



> After checking the interest box for the Milstein Program on the Common App, applicants should use the supplemental College of Arts and Sciences essay to explain how they are a good fit with the Milstein Program.



https://milstein-program.as.cornell.edu/current-high-school-students

Hi! Quick question: If I check the box for Cornell that I want to be considered for the Milstein Program, does anyone know if that affects your chances for just getting into Cornell in general?





Thanks!



> I live in NY.



I think you answered your own question. Go with CALS and get that in-state tuition.

The interview is not really an interview. It is just a conversation with an alum. They dont report anything back to admissions. Its just to allow you to learn more about the school.

What is unique about the field in Cornell?



Please see the NBB website for Undergraduate Research: https://nbb.cornell.edu/undergraduate#undergraduate-research

Clubs are super competitive and most have three rounds of interviews with very low acceptance rates (lower than the university itself)

I think the other answer was about project teams, CS clubs are more collaborative and welcoming and usually just have one interview with a higher acceptance rate (for example, ACSU usually accepts 30-70% of apps depending on subteam). In general the CS major is pretty competitive bc of internship opportunities, though most CS classes have group projects.

>Are there any specific group projects you enjoyed





>Collaborative CS related clubs?





>Any specific classes that are collaborative? 



Cornell CS has a practicum requirement. You can look into those classes.



>And is the cornell student body collaborative?



Yeah, I think so. I guess everyone is trying to get jobs like the other comment said, but that doesn't mean they're not going to be friendly. Most people I talk to are willing to help out and work together. I don't think this is unique to Cornell. I would think (and hope) students at almost every CS program are like this. I can't imagine any college where students are so competitive they're not willing to help their friends out.



>Are there any specific places where CS students like to meet up to study?



Duffield Hall, Upson Hall, the undergrad CIS lounge in Rhodes Hall



I'm guessing you're trying to write your Why Cornell essay. If so, I would suggest taking another angle maybe. Collaboration and teamwork are things you'll find almost everywhere, idk maybe someone will disagree with me.

Thanks for sharing, that's definitely useful info.  Are you a CS major btw?

What is there to be said about collaboration within the cornell CS department?  Are there any specific group projects you enjoyed or collaborative CS related clubs?  Any specific classes that are collaborative?  And is the cornell student body collaborative?  Are there any specific places where CS students like to meet up to study?

Apply to arts. It’s more flexible in terms of selecting a major and sounds like the best fit base on your interests.



Any help would be appreciated thanks!

yes, you can. who are you trying to do research with?

thank you! the research is relating to public health do you know if this also applies to cornell's grad schools? can you research with a cornell grad school faculty as an undergrad?

Yes, you can!

thank you!!

Can students at cornell cas do research with faculty at cornell humec?

ILR ≠ Business. I wouldn't apply to ILR unless you have a strong reason to. Based on your interests, it seems like these are all reasonable options:









Given that it is likely that your opinions will change as you take your first few classes, applying to CALS will give you the most flexibility in the future.

Thanks! 



ILR acceptance rate is higher than CAS and CALS and it had business courses that's why I was exploring that.

I would ignore this conception of pure "acceptance rate." ILR is a specialized college and as with any specialty school, you will have less overall applications where more of the candidates' profiles are aligned with that specialty. You will notice from 2021 admissions statistics that ILR has an extremely high yield (number entering vs number accepted).



|College|Applied|Accepted|Entering|Rate|Yield|

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|**CAS**|30,670|2,191|1,285|7.14%|58.6%|

|**CALS**|6,679|820|604|12.3%|73.7%|

|**ILR**|1,304|224|168|17.2%|75.0%|

Help me decide which college or major to apply, Cornell is super-reach for me.



GPA: UW 3.74, W 4.17, CA Bay Area Competitive School, ACT: 35, 3 APs (APCS 5, APUS 3, AP CALC AB 4) & 4 Honors till 11th, 4 APs in 12th



EC: (1) Founder of 2 non profits (with actual work and growth in last 2 years), (2) Eagle Boy Scout, (3) Varsity Sports Team Member (not recruited athlete), (4) Community Service Project for saving food wastage (5) Ongoing research project (Data analytics and ML) for underprivileged student's (6) Ongoing research project (Data analytics and ML) for CAL fire (7) Google Data Analytics Certificate



My interest is in learning CS + Business + Data Science and my ECs are kind of mixed because of that. I can apply to ILR as noticed that it have Data Science concentration and business courses, but it does not have any CS courses. 





Im so sorry to hear that :(  I think if your interview essay is good, you'll be at a small disadvantage but dw! as long as your portfolio is good, you'll get in! I understand the feeling of missing an interview-- i almost missed mine haha. 



Don't worry if you dont get in, its such a small school... i believe the incoming class is about 30 students. There's so many other architecture schools out there, just make sure you have choices open!

Thanks for replying, I submitted my interview essay and believe my portfolio is good but I know I’ll be competing against an extremely talented array of students and haven’t been able to get feedback on my portfolio from someone with experience to determine how it compares to other students. Being February, I’m in that limbo of not having the stress of submitting applications but also not having the relief of knowing if I got in anywhere. Thank you for your advice and kind words, where I get in for undergrad isn’t an end-all-be-all (but fingers crossed for Cornell :)

Help with Architecture Admissions!



In 2018, Dyson had 4,168 applications, 122 acceptences, and 90 students entering. That is a 2.93% acceptance rate and a 73.8% yield.



In 2021, Dyson had 5,053 applications, 275 acceptences, and 175 students entering. That is a 5.44% acceptance rate and a 63.6% yield.

Happy New Year everyone, I was just wondering the true acceptance rate of Cornell AEM



I've seen it at 3% and I've seen posts saying it's higher. Some even say higher than CAS



Just want to know the true acc rate

I didn’t submit a resume since my common app pretty much covered it for me, but if you have other experiences to share (like work, certifications, etc) then the resume would probably be the place to do so.

I would say activities not listed in the common app

What is Cornell looking for with the resume submission? Do they want activities not listed in common app, or is it moreso to show how you will take your career?

Not sure if someone can answer this, but where is the question asking whether or not I want Cornell to look at my SAT? All of the other schools I’m applying to ask that in their college-specific questions, but I don’t see it in Cornell. How am I supposed to know if Cornell is going to consider it? Btw, applying for college of arts and sciences, so sat should be test optional according to their website.

submit.

Literally exactly the same. CS class of 26 to CoE with 1470 SAT, 760 math 710 English

curious to know what your ec’s were if you don’t mind me asking? I don’t have that many

yo can i ask what your ec’s were? I’m thinking about ED’ing to Cornell Next year. I’ll have a slightly higher score than you 1530 but probably less ec’s. Curious what I could do for ec’s

Member of student council since freshman year, member of NHS junior and senior, president of NHS senior year. JV and Varsity soccer all four years, one of the captains the second year on both. Was on the varsity track team a few years and held a job senior and junior year during the winter. I am also a legacy student and live in close proximity to Cornell so I think that helped a bit too.

same exact scenario for me. here’s to hoping i can do enough on my essays to prove my worth

The only thing I can think of is that it doesn’t have to be super official. If I needed stuff to list I might put skiing because even though I’m not on a official team or anything, I still do it for multiple hours every week. Things like that which show your dedicated to something and you have a wide range of interest might be better than nothing

Hi! If i’m applying as a CS major w/ a 3.95 GPA, should I go test-optional w/ my 1500?

a solid 20% I would say

Has anyone who has gotten the transfer option not completed the exact requirements? If so please pm me😊

Not sure about the others but A&S has a lower admission rate because it's more popular! It has a ton of majors since the focus of the college is so broad

You can submit your music supp if you want, but not mandatory. I guess it depends on your situation. If you want to major in psychology and your essay is about music and the mind, the music supp would support that, for example.



You can see the benefit of applying ED at this link. HumEc acceptance rate is actually around 50% with ED! https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jx54xf/cornell_ed_admit_rates_by_college_using_math/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Hello!! Here are some questions I have--I apologize if some sound too rudimentary... I know a lot of these questions can be answered by a quick Google search on my behalf, but I would love to hear the opinion of real students and past applicants!



(AFAIK)--Underaduate degrees for Psyc. are offered at the College of Arts & Sciences, and Human Ecology major is offered at The College of Human Ecology. What is the difference between these two colleges and majors?  Is one college harder to get in to than the other? (I think that requires research on my behalf--but I would love to talk to someone who is involved in one of these colleges/college branches!) Please forgive me if we aren't allowed to post links--but this website says the College of A&S has a 8.8% accep. rate and The College of Human Ec. is 23%.  [https://www.powerfulprep.com/how-to-get-into-cornell/](https://www.powerfulprep.com/how-to-get-into-cornell/)   

Why? Is it because of number of applicants? I heard that A&S has more apps. and students. Is it because of that? 



Does admission rate go up/down based on major popularity?







Does being a NY Resident affect chances of admission, & chances of early admission? What would the chances be of admittance for a NY resident who doesn't submit test scores? 



Thank you so much for your time and the read. Have a good one and please stay safe. :)

No an ipad will not be enough. Every engineering major needs to take an intro to programming course, and you will need an actual computer for that. Most majors also have specific software that you will need to use on a computer. You can use the computer labs, but it will be massively inconvenient (wasting many hours per week probably). If you are only getting one device, get a laptop not an ipad.

while the other person is right that having your own laptop will be handy, there are plenty of ways around this. several libraries on campus have desktop computers with plenty of programs on this that you would never bother getting on your own computer. I never found this massively inconvenient, in fact i typically preferred using the desktops in the libraries because they are way bigger than my laptop screen, and some libraries have two desktops at one station for dual screen, and the engineering library has touch screen desktops. it's a good point that for intro to matlab/python you might like to work on this stuff on your own computer, but what i did when i was working on a spreadsheet for ex, is i would just email it to myself at the end of the day. you could also just get a flash drive. ALSO, you can rent laptops from the library. Last semester my computer was broken so i just kept renting laptops. There's longterm leases for two weeks and also 3 hour renting. Protip: you can check out a 3 hour laptop, and then just renew it every three hours for infinity. there's never so much demand that they ask for the laptop back. and you can ask to renew it like an hour before closing time at the library and that'll make it due the next morning so you can keep it overnight. and you have like an hour or two window after the 3 hours before their system starts sending emails insisting you'll be in trouble if you don't bring it back. But i think you would actually manage just fine with just an ipad, just keep in mind you will need to use cornell computers in some way at some point

Ok thank you so much!!!

No idea. I would still recommend a laptop, since you can do much more.

You'll need a GRE score... And GPA boost likely. This is one of the most competitive CS graduate programs.



Intended program:







* No GRE



I wanted to add to my chance me , I also wrote about high in my school we dont really have any particals from physics and chem so I would make artwork which used the principal that were taught to us in class so maybe like optics I creates a glass pieces, when we were taught about light and colloidal substances I made a scene with light pass through  and also a explosion simulation.

I wouldn't worry about Cornell looking down on the fact that you're from a small town and had less achievements/activities/advanced classes than people from cities and prestigious high schools; Cornell takes into consideration the opportunities you actually have available to you, and simply look at how you were able to use the resources around you to the best of your abilities! You might even have a slight advantage because you stand out among students who usually don't reach for such prestigious universities. And since you said you took the best classes you could, and have quite a few unique and impressive achievements, you seem pretty qualified to me!

Thanks for the kind words I am actually trying to piggy bank on the uniqueness on my application to get into Cornell

You need 120 credits to graduate, averaging \~15 credits a semester. You will need to take \~5 classes a semester to grad in 4 years. But, you are always more marketable and ready for a career the more you do, so I wouldn't personally recommend just trying to the minimum. Take advantage of what Cornell can offer you!



But it isn't tidy like that. A&S (CAS) requires a language, which could be 4 or 6 credits. Many classes are 4 credits and require 1 or 2 credit labs. And you pretty much have to do the work on your schedule yourself to find the classes that meet the requirements of your major. There are resources like: [https://courses.cornell.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603) for you to read thoroughly. And there is a huge chance you will change your direction during the first two years that Cornell gives you before you declare a major.

Not sure if it will be mcclintock but the entirety of north campus where freshmen live is uphill lol. I’ve seen people skate around so not impossible but probably easier going to classes then coming back.

Where will the freshmen all girls dorm be next year if Balch is closed? I heard it might be McClintock Hall, is this true? Also if it is McClintock Hall, is it an uphill walk to get there? I would like to bring my skateboard to travel but I don’t know if paths are too steep

Nearly no differences in terms of research for undergrads...but if you're interested in getting minors or experiences in engineering-related fields, e.g. BME, BE, etc., CALS would be a better choice.

ok, if the classes are taught be a high school teacher at a high school then i don't think Cornell would count them as college credits. Cornell doesn't allow dual enrollment credits from what i understand (ie my high school taught College Chem instead of AP Chem and i didn't get any credit for it at Cornell because my high school chemistry teacher taught it, even though it really was like the same material as Chem 2070 at cornell). If it's a college professor teaching at the high school, that might be ok, but i'd look into Cornell's policies about it (and whatever other colleges you apply to)

Tbh, nobody will give you an accurate probability. But you have decent stats.



Also, you mentioned an exciting topic to talk about in your essay.



One piece of advice spend a lot of time browsing your intended school at Cornell to find the answers to why Cornell?. 

Essays are mattered a lot, so do your best. However, don’t stress over extras. 



Finally, I wish you all the best in your application progress and future endeavors.

i had about the same extras as you so dont worry too much haha. you seem pretty good to me! like you're aware you're definitely not the most exciting candidate ever but for candidates of your level i feel like ive met ppl at cornell with similar profiles to you. i personally had less honor societies but i did theater my whole middle school/high school and had clear progression imo. but you're applying to hum ec which is a state school (i did cals im from nys too). so i think you have as good of chances as me and i got in (well maybe a little less idk how much cornell tries to reduce the long island/nyc/westchester kids they get). but yeah i dont think you're a 100% shoo in but no reason to despair i wouldnt be surprised at all if you get in



I’d love someone to chance my.

Pros and cons of cornell tech vs cornell in ithaca? Prospective CS student

I believe emails for HEOP RD came out about 3-4 weeks ago! I would contact their Diversity & Outreach office for more info considering it is time sensitive.

Hi there!

Mind blown that you actually knew about this

>instit



Also, if you have any advice on how to differentiate this essay from the human ecology one of "How has your decision to apply to the College of Human Ecology been influenced by your related experiences? How will your choice of major impact your goals and plans for the future?" Thanks!

Think about it as past, present, and future. What has happened in your past and what have you already accomplished that has led you to your modern aspirations and goals. In other words, “how did something in the past shape my present?” Ive seen students use this to explain their motivations and ‘why’. 





For future: care about your legacy. You are joining a community of thousands of Cornellians. How will this help your goals? Where do you see yourself carrying the Cornell name and where will you take your own? 



Quick question that I see many others asking but I want to phrase it more clearly. The two prompts for transfers are essentially:







These prompts are relatively similar and both contain an aspect of wanting:



\- a section of writing about your own character



\-a section of writing about why you'd want to go to Cornell





Including a paragraph or two of each of the above bullet points in each essay satisfies each prompt, however it feels choppy and repetitive. Has anyone thought about doing the first essay all on your own character and why you stand out, and the second essay focused just on why Cornell is beneficial for you?





Hey, I'm just a little confused now because. there's a prompt for the Transfer Option application, but there aren't actually any word limits or anything so I don't know what admissions expects or wants...."Please share how the experiences during your freshman year have helped to prepare you for a transition into Cornell University CALS and impacted your intended academic goals." Does anyone have advice for that?

What is your end goal? What do you want to do with your education? That’s the most important question. Why do you want to study law as well as human development? How will you apply those two concepts to further your career? 



Good luck!

I'm just curious, but why MechE instead of CS, given you did USACO? But I think you have a very strong application, and probably be admitted, but I'm just a student.

  



  

  



  

3.67 unweighted GPA & 5.07 weighted GPA

  



  

I have a couple of national competition stuff, namely me getting USACO Gold, then a 5th place & 7th place award for national math competitions (MAO if any of you are familiar with it), and AIME Qualifier







  

My essays were ok, I’d say my personal essay and one of the supplementals were pretty good but the other essay was pretty whatever lol

  



  

  



  

My main concern for my app is that aside my competition performance, everything else is kinda mid. Coming from people who have gotten in, what would you say are my odds of getting accepted?

the transfer class at dyson is actually huge so the admissions rate is much higher than the regular undergraduate class. imo the most important things to set your application apart is how much you resonate with dyson values / the core mission statement and how you embody that in day to day life



Does anyone know how easy/hard it is to transfer to dyson AEM from an in state community college?? My advisor says that people transfer there all the time but I was wondering if someone who did this could tell me how difficult or easy it is.

So do you think if I wanted to go into finance or banking it would be better to go to dyson or ILR?

Dyson for sure

Dyson is definitely better, but there are many ILR students going into finance as well.



ILR has a higher acceptance rate than Dyson (~18% compared to ~3%)

Do you know anything about how easier/harder it is to transfer into one or the other??

Thanks. I know Cornell's transfer rates are inflated, but missing this one class has been stressing me out.

Hi, everyone. I'm finishing my second year at a NYS CC this semester and applied to CALS for their Biometry program as a transfer. I have a 4.0, a bunch of awards and good amount of ecs; mostly as a lab assistant in the biology and chemistry departments as well as a math tutor. I feel good about my essay and I know I got awesome recs.





For anyone in the graduate crop and soil science department, what is the likelihood of getting a masters degree in soil science fully funded? how do assistantships work at Cornell? when should I be contacting professors about the research they are conducting? any other grad school advice welcome as well. thank you!

1. yes, but it doesn't count much, if at all. parents are considered a "primary" legacy, and have an effect on the applicant, whereas siblings are considered "secondary" and have little to no effect on the applicant.

2. no, deferred applicants will simply be put into the same pool as regular decision applicants and will be treated the same as them

They do have a math placement test for multivariable that you could study for to get credit for it. 

https://math.cornell.edu/ap



Sometimes it is the decision and sometimes people get it off of the waitlist.

Did you end up going

Can anyone speak to:







Typical Cornell CS student profile. Your chances are very good.

Kinda shitty EC’s and rlly good essays 

Depending on ED size and how unique/good ur essays r I’d say ~50% chance

Ok yea the school responded and said they do thx.

Yes! Upload them :) Anything that will give you an edge to your app and your gut tells you to do it, do it

I would not. An admissions officer doesn't want to read your academic paper.

Early acceptance letter into SHA

Since I don't know if anyone answered this for you I'd say that more than a couple Cs or a D/F is probably when you'd encounter a problem. However, be aware that the university will contact you first to ask what caused your grades to drop like that, so you might be able to make a case for yourself regardless of what your grades look like by the end of the academic year

First year! Senior in HS rn. Thanks!!!

Congrats!

Congrats! Did you get in as First-year or transfer student?

BRO I ALSO GOT EARLY ADMISSION TO SHA! SEE YOU THERE!!

thank you! That's what I thought but should I have some bio/ag-related extracurricularar to relate to the college (which I don't)?

No clue. Write about your own interests. Don't make up stuff that you aren't truly passionate about.

Cornell admits by school, not by major. If you are a NY resident and apply to a statutory college (CALS, HumEc, ILR), you will have a better chance of admission.



Yeah, I knew that about the legacy, and that’s a shame about APUSH, but at least they’ll still see I did well on the exam. Thanks!

Some things of note:





https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?catoid=45&navoid=18035

uh oh my cool format didn’t work out but I hope this makes sense LMAO

Source: CALS transfer from Tech

I don’t know much about double majoring, but I also got into CS at GT last year and at an info session, they made it sound like it’s difficult to take many classes outside your major due to a pretty rigid curriculum. That was a huge turn off for me and considering that you’re thinking of double majoring, it might be for you as well. Definitely go to an info session at both schools if you’re able to!

My 2nd choices were either Colorado State or UC Davis. I chose Cornell because it is the top in Animal Science and they offered good financial aid. I honestly didn't know that much about it before coming here and I wasn't certain about my choice up until the moment I accepted my spot here.

I transferred here and I recall being able to submit only one letter of recommendation, so determine who you think wrote the best one. Also, it should be one of the three your professors wrote.



GPA is fine. It's not going to detract from your application.



In my opinion, the most important part of the transfer application is the "why do you want to transfer to Cornell?" essay. This profile you've posted here doesn't mean much. If you don't have legitimate reasons to apply to Cornell specifically you'll get rejected no matter what your stats look like at any of Cornell's colleges.  With that said, I think you can make a good case for wanting to come to Cornell for its many research opportunities, given your prior experience.

I'm transferring from a small community college in rural Virginia. Surprised so many credits would transfer over. Nobody in my family holds a college degree. Will these factors hurt my chances? I hear legacy students have the highest chance of admission..

Not really. Legacy helps but it’s not huge. I would really explore your passions In your essay, I’d be happy to read it over if it helps but I’m just a freshmen in ILR



Tbh idk how many older students they take but I wouldn’t worry about legacy too much. Plenty of non legacy students get admitted, especially to ilr. 



Good luck!

Decent chance, where r u transferring from? Also with a cool story like that I’d say it helps you out even more

Materials can be submitted late, as long as they are received by January 10th.



https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/

To the best of my knowledge, you can minor in any available minor, no matter the school you are in and it is in. I have no idea if a dance minor exists, but you can google it.

SO COOL OF YOU :O

Yes I am doing this exact thing, totally possible

Thank you for the reply! I was worried because some people say I need to halve the general acceptance rate to get the acceptance rate for international student. Would it be that hard for international students not requiring financial aid or will it be slightly less if I don't ask for the financial aid?

Thank you so much for the help!

It's a bit easier to get into CALS instate compared to oos. Being an international still puts you at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to domestic students even if you don't need financial aid. However, it mostly depends on where you go to school.

Thank You for your response! I am happy to see you again here. How are you liking Cornell?

Pretty good, the weather is crazy tho 😅

Hi, former TO here!



It is mainly for new activities but you can also put any significant activities you did since you last submitted your application to Cornell

I read something about roughly 20% of transfer students were from CC in recent years. Looks like they don't put much weight into where transfers come from, so long as they fit in with the culture. I'm a fellow transfer applicant! Good luck :)



Ugh I’ve been searching for this info! Thank you!

It’s a very good accomplishment. I think the acceptance rate is 20% maybe even lower (this year).

Try to find someone at your current school who handles transferring and can give you advice on what to do to prepare as best as possible for applying to Cornell. You can look at cornell’s econ page and find what courses they recommend you should take before transferring too, based on your year in college (at least CALS has this on their webpage). Cornell should also have many resources online with tips on how to prepare to apply as a transfer. Make sure you write a nice essay and get a good reference letter too, and maybe try to buff up your extracurriculars too if you think you are lacking.

Thank you so much!

This is called a likely letter. I received one that said almost exactly that, but not from diversity outreach. They probably are writing yours because you add diversity to Cornell in some way they really liked. It's them letting you know that you are accepted, but Cornell can't officially tell you that until Ivy Day because that is the contract the Ivies make with each other. Likely letters are a way around that. Congratulations and welcome!

Congrats 🎉🎊🎈

Thank you so much for replying! Cornell still seems a bit scary but you make it seem way more doable. I'll continue considering it.

Will try to be as genuine as possible here. I am currently a senior who has an extra semester left because of COVID. Not exaggerating when I say that it is the best of times and the worst of times here. The weather is ass for more than half of the school year and seasonal depression gets real when we don’t see the sun for weeks. If you’re not from the northeast like me, make sure you really prepare with a good quality winter coat (there are reasonably priced ones plz don’t get a Canada goose 😭) and boots etc. ofc it depends some on your major, but overall the academics are very rigorous here and once your first exam of the semester passes by they just keep on coming until you graduate… time management is key and if you are accustomed to being at the top of your class in high school, like most of us were, prepare to get reality checked. 



Like any other school, finding your place at Cornell is essential and will make or break your experience. I almost dropped out twice (hence the leave of absence) but am still here because of the connections I’ve made with people and communities at Cornell. I wouldn’t give these relationships up for the world. My best advice is to immerse yourself in whatever clubs/activities you can that suite your interests and try to be as social as possible even though it seems like the most daunting thing when you first arrive on campus. Opting for a roommate(s) when you select a dorm situation is not only cheaper but will help you make friends in the long run. Work/life balance is the greatest challenge for all of us but it is the life connections I’ve made that convinced me to stay here.

Aside from it being hard for me to move away from home, I love Cornell and am generally very happy here. There is so much nature which was a college necessity for me, but also do many amazing buildings and places to explore, on top of all the opportunities here. The reddit unfortunately becomes a place to complain and ask questions, so it can be off putting, I remember thinking the same. Don't let it scare you.

Cornell was a waste of my time and a mistake I regret. 



A name is not everything

dont trust reddit. most people here are loners or depressed or both. ive had a fantastic time here despite the ups and downs.

Honestly Cornell is what you make of it. Don't stress yourself out  too much or put too much pressure on yourself and you'll do just fine. The weather here is very strange but on the days that there is sun, Cornell transforms into a beautiful place. Everyone starts to socialize more, people will relax on the lawns and play games. I find these days so beautiful. There are going to be hard days and there are going to be good. For me the good parts of Cornell are the times I spend with my friends. Those times where we are just sitting together and studying or playing games in our dorms. Everyone here is very motivated to do good and there are those who are super competitive. If you come here and give it some time you will find where you belong.

You definitely got this. Incredible work you have done. Don’t stress.

I was accepted off the waitlist on the 4th.

if your math/science background isn’t super strong, i highly recommend you brush up on some basic chem and calc 1. i’m a current freshman and while i was okay with chem 2090 because i have a stronger chem background, my math background is pretty bad and i wish someone would’ve told me to just relook at some basic calc. also if you can, just take the summer off and chill. i worked crazy hours throughout the summer and i never got a true break, which reflected in my studies this semester. you did all the hard work; relax and enjoy one of your last summers!

Thank you! I applied ED as an incoming freshman.

My son was 3.97(UW), 4.75(W), 1530 SAT, two varsity sports and won state-level awards for musical performance.  He was just accepted ED.

In that sense, do CALS and DYSON count as the "same college" that one can double major in?



https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/major-changes-and-double-major



[2] https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/double-major/

~~I would assume so given this notice:~~



~~"Note: While meeting or exceeding the above criteria will increase your competitiveness, it does not ensure approval to double major in AEM."~~







CAS website: "If you decide to add another major, it must be within the College of Arts & Sciences"

Yes. Usually the rule is that double majors must be in the same college, but minors can be across colleges. Do double check with the relevant schools and departments websites as there are sometimes caveats.

aight

Application straight into the garbage. /s



Come on, stop worrying about it. You are fine.

Thanks! Do you know anyone who has done this?

No, but if you search the subreddit for "internal transfer" you will find many posts on the topic.

cool, thanks again

Wow, thanks for the info. Merry Christmas!

 https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/advising/internal-transfer-engineering



https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/advising/internal-transfer-engineering/internal-transfer-frequently-asked-questions

Ok yeah i will, but also i just felt like if i indicated interest on my app they might take that into consideration and maybe it would be a positive

If you are more interested in data science, I would say ORIE is probably more applied and has more of the data science aspect. Other than that, CAS has more liberal arts requirements and a language requirement, while COE has more science and math classes in its core curriculum.

I am very confused between your posts. Are you currently a junior or a senior?



If you are a senior, I am greatly confused and you would need to prove extenuating circumstances to Cornell about your high school mathematics curriculum...





yeah i think cornell in washington is a big thing for gov majors

its also moreso what you actually want to do...don't apply to a&s just cause you think thats easier, instead think about what you want to learn outside of the major. doing psych in a&s will mean that you are taking things like language, quantitative reasoning, and overall just more hollistic ed. While hum dev is centered on the dynamics of the human race--and while both departments have a lot of overlap, you cant double major in them anyways, and only a certain amount of out-of-school credits will even count towards your major. gl

I thiught they did, but at half the credit



Here is the CALS policy: https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/non-cornell-credit/college-credit-earned-while-high-school



(Similar policies exist for all colleges at Cornell)

Thank you

In the upload portal, there is a spot for Optional Supplemental Material. Should I submit it there?

Yup!

LOCI is submitted on the portal. There should be an upload spot specifically for it.

Hello!



Will do! Good luck to you too! :D

hey! did you get in?

Hello!



 90% chance youll get in, Ik plenty of Dyson kids and they have like half as many EC‘s as u wit similar gpa

Thank you!

Honestly, I think you know you have a shot. Most applicants are very qualified, but not everyone can get in. At this point, it’s less about how qualified you are, and more about the fit; both Cornell as a fit for you, and you as a fit for Cornell. Good luck!

“When” I get in. Haha—thanks for the positivity!

Let me know when you get in (sadly my opinon doesn't count tho... im an applicant this year too).

Check the weather for when you’re going to be here. Then, pack for 15 degrees above and below. Bring layers so you don’t need to bring a heavy jacket if it gets cold. Bring super comfortable shoes, you will be walking a LOT!

I'm not a student, but I'm from the northeast, and I have to second that layers are your best friend here! Bring a bag to carry water and extra layers with you, it's much better than tying things around your waist or over your shoulder. The weather often contradicts itself, too, as it can change quickly- hence the saying "If you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes.". Especially in spring, it may feel hot in the sun (especially if you wear dark clothing), but freezing cold when a cloud or breeze passes by.

I know transferring is hard, especially for A&S

Transfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.

ohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?

its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set up

Keep in mind that transferring isn't easy. Most transfers are TOs (basically Cornell's 1-year-delayed-acceptance).

As a fellow highschool science fair presenter, congrats on that first place at your regional fair! You should be proud of yourself :)

I started going track my sophomore year of hs! I only did cross country my junior and senior year! Absolutely loved track/xc (despite my number of injuries) and I met some great friends. I encourage you to do extracurriculars that YOU care about and not ones soley the basis of impressing a college. This is exactly what I did in hs and I was admitted this year in the rd round to CALS at Cornell. Good luck!

It looks like there are  two with that last name - Robert and Jon. Here are their webpages at Cornell with their emails



https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/



https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/

Lmao... i submitted 2 days ago

Gpa and sat score don’t matter as much as you think. There are a lot of people who apply with the same stats. The admissions officers are not going to be like “Hmmm, this kid got a 1510 and this kid only got a 1500. I’m gonna take the 1510 kid”. They look at the essay to decide. They want someone who will add to the community, not someone who holes up in their dorm reading doing test prep all day.

When did you get that? I believe we haven’t received one yet.

When I got accepted last year, I don’t think I got anything in the mail. We did get an online code for a free class of 2025 t-shirt though!

Not international but for your ECs they don't have to relate at all to your career. Do whatever you like and that's all that matters. Cornell has hundreds of clubs and the people in them come from all kinds of majors.

I hope this is a joke. Burn please.

really good profile

Hi, I'm asking for a friend cause she's not on Reddit, but do these materials include Cornell's Supplement?

Probably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.

The latter, but you are allowed to submit materials late, as long as it is received by January 10th.



https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/12/21/a-note-to-regular-decision-applicants/

Ask what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.

Current SHA soph here. I sort of did the same thing when I applied. I couldn't decide between AEM and A&S and so I applied to SHA for fun also I saw the low acceptance rate at AEM and so I leaned into my host job and got in. The reason the major can be boring is only because it is so broad. Yes, the hotel administration major is broad. Idk ur exact interests but I like finance and so i find stuff like food management boring. but maybe u dont! It is unlikely someone loves finance, financial accounting, food management, and hospitality development. (ps i heard a rumor they arent making all the classes mandatory but instead optional with different tracks in like a couple years) Luckily, the classes are not usually that much of a grind so u can just focus on other stuff when they are boring. The major has a fair bit of elective space so u can just load up on other stuff u like. Another good thing is that the connections are rly rly good especially in hospitality and u arent locking urself into the industry whatsoever. I know a lot of hotelies that put business administration on their resume and no one thinks twice about it. u can check the employment stats but a lot of hotelies dont go into hospitality  (9% only) and instead just do finance (26%) or real estate (26%). the real estate is top of the line here. imo one of the best places to become a real estate analyst. the business dress fridays is called deans distinguished lecture series and its a 1 semester core course, so its not like a regular thing except maybe for a seldom presentation. its not that professional. hotelies are known for being pretty chill imo. im always willing to help out. ur other questions are a bit harder for me to answer but ill do my best. Ithaca is a super unique town so i think it should be a sizable consideration for ur college pick. super cool scenery and isolated i would say. although, the airport is quite nice just doesnt have a ton of flights. the depression meme is a person by person case i would say. there is a big greek life culture especially as part of the biz school. there are also plenty of people who avoid that kinda stuff (me). u can def have ur choice at that here. at least at sha, i would say people are generally happy. the professors at sha are for the most part phenomenal and caring. lastly, congrats! I knew a lot of very qualified people who did not get it, so i wouldnt even consider it an easy path



\-[https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/careers/employment-statistics/](https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/careers/employment-statistics/)



im free to talk more anytime if u wanna, just dm me :)

Who are you friends with!? Omg I feel like I got the least sleep in my life during undergrad - in the best way.

Thanks

Congrats 🎉🎊.

Applying undecided doesn't give you an easier change of transferring. As the other comment says, applying to Arts & Sciences is a good move because their whole things is allowing people to have a diverse education. So you could talk in your essay about how you have all these interests you have build up and want to continue (if you do) while still pursing a STEM education. 







-Columbia is a big name for a reason, but its not engineering.



-Cornell's engineering, at least the MAE department (and probably others!), is wonderful. The classes are fantastic, they push you, they are interesting, the department/faculty CARE about you as an individual, and there are many choices for courses. None of those things could be said for my friend's experience at columbia.



-Columbia is in NYC, cornell is not. My friend very much enjoys living with friends in NYC and had MUCH more time to enjoy himself and have a real life outside of class than I did in ithaca. I seem to be getting better prepared for career recruiting/work after school right now as a result of this.





Id pick cornell engineering > columbia engineering any day. Hope this helps a bit.

? If you’re talking about the thanksgiving dinner at RPCC then no. It’s just thanksgiving-style dining hall experience.

Good enough to certainly apply

Anything to improve?

Also, will USESO be impressive? I was a finalist

It is discernable that your spike aligns with neuroscience more than humanities. Again, your chances very much depend on the prestige of all your activities. Where were those research papers published? What professors did you work with? What organisations recognize your app? That kind of stuff can make the difference between Stanford and Georgia Tech

How selective is that program at MIT? That could make a huge difference

Hi! I don’t think one or the other is better. Its just what you want to go into. Either way you can apply to minor in the other. I would look at the classes and talk to current students to figure out which vibe fits you better. Your stats seem good but those wont be the standout thing so definitely figure out which supplemental essay feels like a closer fit. Best of luck!

Yes, but keep in mind that for the first two years, most of your college resources will be dominated by the college you're primarily in, regardless of whether you intend to double major or not.

Ah thanks, didn't know! Bowers CIS can be confusing.

fair. i feel like infosci and biometry are similar enough majors in terms of learning outcomes, and if you have already fulfilled most of the requirements then you'll have more room in your schedule to take bio classes - good luck!

> this stupid class I don't really care about.



honestly i'm a little perplexed by this comment considering you want to be a biometry major.. you realize that's a lot of statistics right?



https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/admissions/





https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-requirements/distribution/

I very much doubt you would have any issues there

You only need to satisfy distribution requirements of which there are many classes that might satisfy the same distribution requirement, Cornell is quite flexible. I’m not a bio person either but there are a number of easy bio classes here as well that satisfy bio requirements (we have a bio requirement in CAS as well)

It is not a deal breaker.

Seems like consideration for Milstein happens after RD release, so I would assume it does not have a bearing on admissions.





But do make sure to consider this quote from the program site:



> After checking the interest box for the Milstein Program on the Common App, applicants should use the supplemental College of Arts and Sciences essay to explain how they are a good fit with the Milstein Program.



https://milstein-program.as.cornell.edu/current-high-school-students



> I live in NY.



I think you answered your own question. Go with CALS and get that in-state tuition.

The interview is not really an interview. It is just a conversation with an alum. They dont report anything back to admissions. Its just to allow you to learn more about the school.



Please see the NBB website for Undergraduate Research: https://nbb.cornell.edu/undergraduate#undergraduate-research

Thanks for sharing, that's definitely useful info.  Are you a CS major btw?

Clubs are super competitive and most have three rounds of interviews with very low acceptance rates (lower than the university itself)

I think the other answer was about project teams, CS clubs are more collaborative and welcoming and usually just have one interview with a higher acceptance rate (for example, ACSU usually accepts 30-70% of apps depending on subteam). In general the CS major is pretty competitive bc of internship opportunities, though most CS classes have group projects.

>Are there any specific group projects you enjoyed





>Collaborative CS related clubs?





>Any specific classes that are collaborative? 



Cornell CS has a practicum requirement. You can look into those classes.



>And is the cornell student body collaborative?



Yeah, I think so. I guess everyone is trying to get jobs like the other comment said, but that doesn't mean they're not going to be friendly. Most people I talk to are willing to help out and work together. I don't think this is unique to Cornell. I would think (and hope) students at almost every CS program are like this. I can't imagine any college where students are so competitive they're not willing to help their friends out.



>Are there any specific places where CS students like to meet up to study?



Duffield Hall, Upson Hall, the undergrad CIS lounge in Rhodes Hall



I'm guessing you're trying to write your Why Cornell essay. If so, I would suggest taking another angle maybe. Collaboration and teamwork are things you'll find almost everywhere, idk maybe someone will disagree with me.

Apply to arts. It’s more flexible in terms of selecting a major and sounds like the best fit base on your interests.

thank you! the research is relating to public health do you know if this also applies to cornell's grad schools? can you research with a cornell grad school faculty as an undergrad?

Yes, you can!

thank you!!

yes, you can. who are you trying to do research with?

Thanks! 



ILR acceptance rate is higher than CAS and CALS and it had business courses that's why I was exploring that.

I would ignore this conception of pure "acceptance rate." ILR is a specialized college and as with any specialty school, you will have less overall applications where more of the candidates' profiles are aligned with that specialty. You will notice from 2021 admissions statistics that ILR has an extremely high yield (number entering vs number accepted).



|College|Applied|Accepted|Entering|Rate|Yield|

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|**CAS**|30,670|2,191|1,285|7.14%|58.6%|

|**CALS**|6,679|820|604|12.3%|73.7%|

|**ILR**|1,304|224|168|17.2%|75.0%|

ILR ≠ Business. I wouldn't apply to ILR unless you have a strong reason to. Based on your interests, it seems like these are all reasonable options:









Given that it is likely that your opinions will change as you take your first few classes, applying to CALS will give you the most flexibility in the future.

Thanks for replying, I submitted my interview essay and believe my portfolio is good but I know I’ll be competing against an extremely talented array of students and haven’t been able to get feedback on my portfolio from someone with experience to determine how it compares to other students. Being February, I’m in that limbo of not having the stress of submitting applications but also not having the relief of knowing if I got in anywhere. Thank you for your advice and kind words, where I get in for undergrad isn’t an end-all-be-all (but fingers crossed for Cornell :)

Im so sorry to hear that :(  I think if your interview essay is good, you'll be at a small disadvantage but dw! as long as your portfolio is good, you'll get in! I understand the feeling of missing an interview-- i almost missed mine haha. 



Don't worry if you dont get in, its such a small school... i believe the incoming class is about 30 students. There's so many other architecture schools out there, just make sure you have choices open!

In 2018, Dyson had 4,168 applications, 122 acceptences, and 90 students entering. That is a 2.93% acceptance rate and a 73.8% yield.



In 2021, Dyson had 5,053 applications, 275 acceptences, and 175 students entering. That is a 5.44% acceptance rate and a 63.6% yield.

I didn’t submit a resume since my common app pretty much covered it for me, but if you have other experiences to share (like work, certifications, etc) then the resume would probably be the place to do so.

I would say activities not listed in the common app

Literally exactly the same. CS class of 26 to CoE with 1470 SAT, 760 math 710 English

curious to know what your ec’s were if you don’t mind me asking? I don’t have that many

yo can i ask what your ec’s were? I’m thinking about ED’ing to Cornell Next year. I’ll have a slightly higher score than you 1530 but probably less ec’s. Curious what I could do for ec’s

Member of student council since freshman year, member of NHS junior and senior, president of NHS senior year. JV and Varsity soccer all four years, one of the captains the second year on both. Was on the varsity track team a few years and held a job senior and junior year during the winter. I am also a legacy student and live in close proximity to Cornell so I think that helped a bit too.

same exact scenario for me. here’s to hoping i can do enough on my essays to prove my worth

The only thing I can think of is that it doesn’t have to be super official. If I needed stuff to list I might put skiing because even though I’m not on a official team or anything, I still do it for multiple hours every week. Things like that which show your dedicated to something and you have a wide range of interest might be better than nothing

submit.

a solid 20% I would say

Ivy Day has not been decided yet.



https://blog.prepscholar.com/ivy-day-decisions

nah US

I am sorry but I have seen your chat history and... I think you can focus more on yourself rather than..... u get it?

LMAO you would fit in just great here

who me?

Are you international?

Not sure about the others but A&S has a lower admission rate because it's more popular! It has a ton of majors since the focus of the college is so broad

You can see the benefit of applying ED at this link. HumEc acceptance rate is actually around 50% with ED! https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jx54xf/cornell_ed_admit_rates_by_college_using_math/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

You can submit your music supp if you want, but not mandatory. I guess it depends on your situation. If you want to major in psychology and your essay is about music and the mind, the music supp would support that, for example.



Ok thank you so much!!!

No idea. I would still recommend a laptop, since you can do much more.

No an ipad will not be enough. Every engineering major needs to take an intro to programming course, and you will need an actual computer for that. Most majors also have specific software that you will need to use on a computer. You can use the computer labs, but it will be massively inconvenient (wasting many hours per week probably). If you are only getting one device, get a laptop not an ipad.

while the other person is right that having your own laptop will be handy, there are plenty of ways around this. several libraries on campus have desktop computers with plenty of programs on this that you would never bother getting on your own computer. I never found this massively inconvenient, in fact i typically preferred using the desktops in the libraries because they are way bigger than my laptop screen, and some libraries have two desktops at one station for dual screen, and the engineering library has touch screen desktops. it's a good point that for intro to matlab/python you might like to work on this stuff on your own computer, but what i did when i was working on a spreadsheet for ex, is i would just email it to myself at the end of the day. you could also just get a flash drive. ALSO, you can rent laptops from the library. Last semester my computer was broken so i just kept renting laptops. There's longterm leases for two weeks and also 3 hour renting. Protip: you can check out a 3 hour laptop, and then just renew it every three hours for infinity. there's never so much demand that they ask for the laptop back. and you can ask to renew it like an hour before closing time at the library and that'll make it due the next morning so you can keep it overnight. and you have like an hour or two window after the 3 hours before their system starts sending emails insisting you'll be in trouble if you don't bring it back. But i think you would actually manage just fine with just an ipad, just keep in mind you will need to use cornell computers in some way at some point

You'll need a GRE score... And GPA boost likely. This is one of the most competitive CS graduate programs.

I wouldn't worry about Cornell looking down on the fact that you're from a small town and had less achievements/activities/advanced classes than people from cities and prestigious high schools; Cornell takes into consideration the opportunities you actually have available to you, and simply look at how you were able to use the resources around you to the best of your abilities! You might even have a slight advantage because you stand out among students who usually don't reach for such prestigious universities. And since you said you took the best classes you could, and have quite a few unique and impressive achievements, you seem pretty qualified to me!

Thanks for the kind words I am actually trying to piggy bank on the uniqueness on my application to get into Cornell

I wanted to add to my chance me , I also wrote about high in my school we dont really have any particals from physics and chem so I would make artwork which used the principal that were taught to us in class so maybe like optics I creates a glass pieces, when we were taught about light and colloidal substances I made a scene with light pass through  and also a explosion simulation.

You need 120 credits to graduate, averaging \~15 credits a semester. You will need to take \~5 classes a semester to grad in 4 years. But, you are always more marketable and ready for a career the more you do, so I wouldn't personally recommend just trying to the minimum. Take advantage of what Cornell can offer you!



But it isn't tidy like that. A&S (CAS) requires a language, which could be 4 or 6 credits. Many classes are 4 credits and require 1 or 2 credit labs. And you pretty much have to do the work on your schedule yourself to find the classes that meet the requirements of your major. There are resources like: [https://courses.cornell.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603) for you to read thoroughly. And there is a huge chance you will change your direction during the first two years that Cornell gives you before you declare a major.

Not sure if it will be mcclintock but the entirety of north campus where freshmen live is uphill lol. I’ve seen people skate around so not impossible but probably easier going to classes then coming back.

Nearly no differences in terms of research for undergrads...but if you're interested in getting minors or experiences in engineering-related fields, e.g. BME, BE, etc., CALS would be a better choice.

Also, this is my mobile alt. My other account is SafeBusy8172, if someone finds that post, lol.

Forgot to add that I live in the south.

I take them at HS. 

We’re partnered with the local CC so their classes get taught on campus.

12th grade I plan on taking:

AP Comp Science A

ENGL 2322 (British Lit I)

GOVT 2305 (Fed Gov)

HUMA 2323 (World Cultures)



ENGL 2323 (British Lit II)

ECON 2301 (Economics)



ok, if the classes are taught be a high school teacher at a high school then i don't think Cornell would count them as college credits. Cornell doesn't allow dual enrollment credits from what i understand (ie my high school taught College Chem instead of AP Chem and i didn't get any credit for it at Cornell because my high school chemistry teacher taught it, even though it really was like the same material as Chem 2070 at cornell). If it's a college professor teaching at the high school, that might be ok, but i'd look into Cornell's policies about it (and whatever other colleges you apply to)

Tbh, nobody will give you an accurate probability. But you have decent stats.



Also, you mentioned an exciting topic to talk about in your essay.



One piece of advice spend a lot of time browsing your intended school at Cornell to find the answers to why Cornell?. 

Essays are mattered a lot, so do your best. However, don’t stress over extras. 



Finally, I wish you all the best in your application progress and future endeavors.



i had about the same extras as you so dont worry too much haha. you seem pretty good to me! like you're aware you're definitely not the most exciting candidate ever but for candidates of your level i feel like ive met ppl at cornell with similar profiles to you. i personally had less honor societies but i did theater my whole middle school/high school and had clear progression imo. but you're applying to hum ec which is a state school (i did cals im from nys too). so i think you have as good of chances as me and i got in (well maybe a little less idk how much cornell tries to reduce the long island/nyc/westchester kids they get). but yeah i dont think you're a 100% shoo in but no reason to despair i wouldnt be surprised at all if you get in

Cornell Tech is only for grad programs; the campus is beautiful but the community is fairly small. The main campus has both undergrad and post-grad, both great

I believe emails for HEOP RD came out about 3-4 weeks ago! I would contact their Diversity & Outreach office for more info considering it is time sensitive.

Thank you for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it!

if you have solid essays then I’d say you have a competitive chance

Sounds like you have everything on paper for admission. As long as you have a good rec and good paper, I think you’re gtg.

People just come here to rant. Also it is exam season right now, so everyone is stressed. Do not think that this subreddit is an accurate reflection on people's perspectives.

Also, if you have any advice on how to differentiate this essay from the human ecology one of "How has your decision to apply to the College of Human Ecology been influenced by your related experiences? How will your choice of major impact your goals and plans for the future?" Thanks!

Think about it as past, present, and future. What has happened in your past and what have you already accomplished that has led you to your modern aspirations and goals. In other words, “how did something in the past shape my present?” Ive seen students use this to explain their motivations and ‘why’. 





For future: care about your legacy. You are joining a community of thousands of Cornellians. How will this help your goals? Where do you see yourself carrying the Cornell name and where will you take your own? 



What is your end goal? What do you want to do with your education? That’s the most important question. Why do you want to study law as well as human development? How will you apply those two concepts to further your career? 



Good luck!

I'm just curious, but why MechE instead of CS, given you did USACO? But I think you have a very strong application, and probably be admitted, but I'm just a student.

the transfer class at dyson is actually huge so the admissions rate is much higher than the regular undergraduate class. imo the most important things to set your application apart is how much you resonate with dyson values / the core mission statement and how you embody that in day to day life

So do you think if I wanted to go into finance or banking it would be better to go to dyson or ILR?

Dyson for sure

Dyson is definitely better, but there are many ILR students going into finance as well.



ILR has a higher acceptance rate than Dyson (~18% compared to ~3%)

Do you know anything about how easier/harder it is to transfer into one or the other??

Thanks. I know Cornell's transfer rates are inflated, but missing this one class has been stressing me out.

1. yes, but it doesn't count much, if at all. parents are considered a "primary" legacy, and have an effect on the applicant, whereas siblings are considered "secondary" and have little to no effect on the applicant.

2. no, deferred applicants will simply be put into the same pool as regular decision applicants and will be treated the same as them

They do have a math placement test for multivariable that you could study for to get credit for it. 

https://math.cornell.edu/ap

Sometimes it is the decision and sometimes people get it off of the waitlist.

Did you end up going

Ok yea the school responded and said they do thx.

Early acceptance letter into SHA

Congrats!

First year! Senior in HS rn. Thanks!!!

thank you! That's what I thought but should I have some bio/ag-related extracurricularar to relate to the college (which I don't)?

No clue. Write about your own interests. Don't make up stuff that you aren't truly passionate about.

Yeah, I knew that about the legacy, and that’s a shame about APUSH, but at least they’ll still see I did well on the exam. Thanks!

Source: CALS transfer from Tech

Not really. Legacy helps but it’s not huge. I would really explore your passions In your essay, I’d be happy to read it over if it helps but I’m just a freshmen in ILR



Tbh idk how many older students they take but I wouldn’t worry about legacy too much. Plenty of non legacy students get admitted, especially to ilr. 



Good luck!

I'm transferring from a small community college in rural Virginia. Surprised so many credits would transfer over. Nobody in my family holds a college degree. Will these factors hurt my chances? I hear legacy students have the highest chance of admission..

SO COOL OF YOU :O

Thank you so much for the help!

Thank you for the reply! I was worried because some people say I need to halve the general acceptance rate to get the acceptance rate for international student. Would it be that hard for international students not requiring financial aid or will it be slightly less if I don't ask for the financial aid?

Pretty good, the weather is crazy tho 😅

Thank You for your response! I am happy to see you again here. How are you liking Cornell?

Ugh I’ve been searching for this info! Thank you!

Thank you so much!

Thank you so much for replying! Cornell still seems a bit scary but you make it seem way more doable. I'll continue considering it.

Thank you! I applied ED as an incoming freshman.



https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/major-changes-and-double-major

~~I would assume so given this notice:~~



~~"Note: While meeting or exceeding the above criteria will increase your competitiveness, it does not ensure approval to double major in AEM."~~







CAS website: "If you decide to add another major, it must be within the College of Arts & Sciences"

In that sense, do CALS and DYSON count as the "same college" that one can double major in?

aight

No, but if you search the subreddit for "internal transfer" you will find many posts on the topic.

cool, thanks again

Wow, thanks for the info. Merry Christmas!

Thanks! Do you know anyone who has done this?

Ok yeah i will, but also i just felt like if i indicated interest on my app they might take that into consideration and maybe it would be a positive

yeah i think cornell in washington is a big thing for gov majors



Here is the CALS policy: https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-services/academic-resources/non-cornell-credit/college-credit-earned-while-high-school

Hello!



Will do! Good luck to you too! :D

hey! did you get in?

Hello!



Thank you!

“When” I get in. Haha—thanks for the positivity!

I know transferring is hard, especially for A&S

Transfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.

ohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?

its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set up

When did you get that? I believe we haven’t received one yet.

Probably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.

Hi, I'm asking for a friend cause she's not on Reddit, but do these materials include Cornell's Supplement?

Ask what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.

Who are you friends with!? Omg I feel like I got the least sleep in my life during undergrad - in the best way.

Thanks

Good enough to certainly apply

Anything to improve?

You can see the benefit of applying ED at this link. HumEc acceptance rate is actually around 50% with ED! https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jx54xf/cornell_ed_admit_rates_by_college_using_math/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Ok thank you so much!!!

No idea. I would still recommend a laptop, since you can do much more.

I wouldn't worry about Cornell looking down on the fact that you're from a small town and had less achievements/activities/advanced classes than people from cities and prestigious high schools; Cornell takes into consideration the opportunities you actually have available to you, and simply look at how you were able to use the resources around you to the best of your abilities! You might even have a slight advantage because you stand out among students who usually don't reach for such prestigious universities. And since you said you took the best classes you could, and have quite a few unique and impressive achievements, you seem pretty qualified to me!

Thanks for the kind words I am actually trying to piggy bank on the uniqueness on my application to get into Cornell



But it isn't tidy like that. A&S (CAS) requires a language, which could be 4 or 6 credits. Many classes are 4 credits and require 1 or 2 credit labs. And you pretty much have to do the work on your schedule yourself to find the classes that meet the requirements of your major. There are resources like: [https://courses.cornell.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=36&poid=17603) for you to read thoroughly. And there is a huge chance you will change your direction during the first two years that Cornell gives you before you declare a major.

ok, if the classes are taught be a high school teacher at a high school then i don't think Cornell would count them as college credits. Cornell doesn't allow dual enrollment credits from what i understand (ie my high school taught College Chem instead of AP Chem and i didn't get any credit for it at Cornell because my high school chemistry teacher taught it, even though it really was like the same material as Chem 2070 at cornell). If it's a college professor teaching at the high school, that might be ok, but i'd look into Cornell's policies about it (and whatever other colleges you apply to)

I take them at HS. 

We’re partnered with the local CC so their classes get taught on campus.

12th grade I plan on taking:

AP Comp Science A

ENGL 2322 (British Lit I)

GOVT 2305 (Fed Gov)

HUMA 2323 (World Cultures)



ENGL 2323 (British Lit II)

ECON 2301 (Economics)





Thank you for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it!

Mind blown that you actually knew about this

? This links to a Rick Astley You Tube Channel

Dyson for sure

Dyson is definitely better, but there are many ILR students going into finance as well.



ILR has a higher acceptance rate than Dyson (~18% compared to ~3%)

Do you know anything about how easier/harder it is to transfer into one or the other??

So do you think if I wanted to go into finance or banking it would be better to go to dyson or ILR?

Thanks. I know Cornell's transfer rates are inflated, but missing this one class has been stressing me out.

Did you end up going

Congrats!

No clue. Write about your own interests. Don't make up stuff that you aren't truly passionate about.

Not really. Legacy helps but it’s not huge. I would really explore your passions In your essay, I’d be happy to read it over if it helps but I’m just a freshmen in ILR



Tbh idk how many older students they take but I wouldn’t worry about legacy too much. Plenty of non legacy students get admitted, especially to ilr. 



Good luck!

Thank you so much for the help!

Pretty good, the weather is crazy tho 😅

Hello!



Will do! Good luck to you too! :D

hey! did you get in?

Hello!



hey! let me know if you get in!!



RemindMe! 25 days

ohhh ok so these are people that instead of getting denied got the option to transfer in? Or is this something that you can set up?

its an option that you get as part of your letter, its not something you set up

Transfer option. Some people are basically guaranteed to be able to transfer in assuming they take some requirements instead of just being rejected.

Probably applies to Common App as a whole. But you shouldn't think of it as an 'extension' and you should submit it ASAP.

Ask what ever you'd like! Feel free to dm too if you'd prefer. I'm more likely to check messages there.

Anything to improve?

Also, will USESO be impressive? I was a finalist

It is discernable that your spike aligns with neuroscience more than humanities. Again, your chances very much depend on the prestige of all your activities. Where were those research papers published? What professors did you work with? What organisations recognize your app? That kind of stuff can make the difference between Stanford and Georgia Tech

Good enough to certainly apply

Ah thanks, didn't know! Bowers CIS can be confusing.

fair. i feel like infosci and biometry are similar enough majors in terms of learning outcomes, and if you have already fulfilled most of the requirements then you'll have more room in your schedule to take bio classes - good luck!

I very much doubt you would have any issues there

thank you!!

Yes, you can!

I would ignore this conception of pure "acceptance rate." ILR is a specialized college and as with any specialty school, you will have less overall applications where more of the candidates' profiles are aligned with that specialty. You will notice from 2021 admissions statistics that ILR has an extremely high yield (number entering vs number accepted).



|College|Applied|Accepted|Entering|Rate|Yield|

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|**CAS**|30,670|2,191|1,285|7.14%|58.6%|

|**CALS**|6,679|820|604|12.3%|73.7%|

|**ILR**|1,304|224|168|17.2%|75.0%|

yo can i ask what your ec’s were? I’m thinking about ED’ing to Cornell Next year. I’ll have a slightly higher score than you 1530 but probably less ec’s. Curious what I could do for ec’s

same exact scenario for me. here’s to hoping i can do enough on my essays to prove my worth

The only thing I can think of is that it doesn’t have to be super official. If I needed stuff to list I might put skiing because even though I’m not on a official team or anything, I still do it for multiple hours every week. Things like that which show your dedicated to something and you have a wide range of interest might be better than nothing

Member of student council since freshman year, member of NHS junior and senior, president of NHS senior year. JV and Varsity soccer all four years, one of the captains the second year on both. Was on the varsity track team a few years and held a job senior and junior year during the winter. I am also a legacy student and live in close proximity to Cornell so I think that helped a bit too.

I am sorry but I have seen your chat history and... I think you can focus more on yourself rather than..... u get it?

LMAO you would fit in just great here

There's a very good chance that at least a few Cornell administrators or people close to them check r/Cornell \-- just something to keep in mind. You don't want to jeopardize it by announcing it too early.

>Fact: Walmart and Target pay more than Cornell.



You might want to clarify this.  Obviously there are many jobs at Cornell that pay better than what many employees at Warmart and Target are getting.

First of all, I analyzed all non-academic compensation at Cornell years ago and precisely because they get annual wage increases, some were paid way above market. But Cornell also needs to be able to hire new people and sometimes that market exceeds what existing people make. Why should a cook with 27 years make more than a cook with less experience? They're cooking the same thing. Are you the same person who posted this complaint before about cooks being underpaid?





>Why should a cook with 27 years make more than a cook with less experience?



Have you ever worked for a business or organization? Of any kind?



I'm asking this seriously because that comment makes me think that maybe you haven't--and that's fine too.





It's never just "one job". Institutional knowledge is priceless. Someone who has worked in the same position for years or decades is much better equipped to handle unexpected situations or to answer people's questions or help out new hires, compared to someone who hasn't worked there as long. They might have the same job title, but the more experienced employee often provides far more value.

You see what we up against? This person makes it sound like there is no issue and that my skills are the same as someone with three years.

Please keep us in the loop and tell us how we can help.

https://whcuradio.com/news/025520-new-data-shows-ithaca-among-most-expensive-cities-in-nys-us-for-household-bills/

I am talking about UAW positions. All your door checkers, line servers, even the wok cooks, all your building care people who clean your dorms, the grounds are the same as the cooks. A majority of the UAW is paid less than $19.50 per hour even after 27 years.

That sounds like a bad situation to be in and Cornell should absolutely be paying you all more.



You have my support, but my concern is, what can Cornell students or faculty on Reddit do with the information you're providing? If people want to support you in a way that makes a difference, how can they do it?



Disclosing details about a strike 2+ months in advance may jeopardize the effectiveness of it by letting Cornell plan around it, or even by hiring more workers who aren't as likely to strike. So there are a number of downsides to announcing it early, via Reddit. What kind of support from the Reddit community can make it worth that risk?

That seems like a plant.

No, it's not been made official or publicly announced. I'm aware of the risk but something has to get going. Our President is former management of Cornell Dining and we are afraid we aren't being represented properly.  The majority of our people have a second job some have a third.

Open visible support. I understand what you are saying about strike talk here and now. It probably doesn't matter. Many are actively seeking other employment. We are hearing that Cornell will offer a "lump sum" with typical raises which in past has been 2% to 4% range. I'm doing this because I'm a 27-year employee. I've had to hustle, work second jobs, and lived on SNAP to raise my three kids alone.  Now two are on their own and it's not easier because everything is so expensive. This town is very expensive for any employee in the union. We are not compensated for our work like the rest of the university. The daycare is used by professors and administrators only. It's far too costly for the hourly staff.

You see what we are up against?

for more specific guidance:



look at companies you’re interested in, then look at people



if you have cornell as a school on your linkedin, you can see people who also went to cornell



look for job titles that seem the most similar to what you’re interested in doing, and reach out to them

Cornell has an extensive alumni network.

If I were you, I’d reach out to alumni directly on LinkedIn. They might be able to provide you some guidance.

Which degree did you graduate with? (Bach, masters, PhD?). I can direct you to the appropriate resources at Cornell accordingly.

I think as an alumnus you can still utilize Cornell's career services. A friend from class of '18 did this recently

Agreed. 



Dw about missing out on Cornell Career Services. Those people are unbelievably useless.



i’m assuming you’re not financially dependent on having a job, or you would’ve taken any job by now. since that’s the case, you’re privileged enough to pick and choose from a lot of good jobs — what does your resume look like? Make sure it’s no smaller than 10pt font, no images, and clear headings with action words in your relevant experience section. the reality is that auto viewers check your resume first, make sure you have what the job is looking for. 



i found jobs through linkedin, handshake, googling companies that were listed on the career fair roster, and recruiters reaching out to me

Yes, but as a very recent graduate they may be willing to help and have a vested interest in helping OP. Not like they've been alumni for that long. It's worth a try, is what I'm saying.

I would also recommend reaching out to Cornell Career Services (e.g. the folks at Careers Beyond Academia), because even though you have graduated, I think they would still have a vested interest in helping students and former students in finding fulfilling jobs. They may prioritize current students, but I do think they'd be happy to help you, they're really lovely people. 



Seconding the suggestion to reach out to alumin through Linkedin. Again, if you connect with Careers Beyond Academia, they can help you with building an effective Linkedin page, but if not, you can still work on optimizing your linkedin and reaching out to alumni through that. 



If you had good relationships with professors, you could also reach out to them for guidance, support, connections to aid the job hunt.

This is not a true statement. Many tech companies are on hiring freezes right now. Some are even rescinding offers.

I hate when ppl saying its hottest job market and why you cant get a job.Pls don’t be so entitled you know getting interviews, interview questions, interviewers are all random, be grateful of the luck that played in your favor before criticizing someone why are you not getting jobs.

That is a very recent change. OP graduated in December.

How is a fact “entitled”. Y’all hear a word once and just run with it.

Your entitlement is assuming ppl getting jobs with no problem in the current market simply because its “hot”. You won’t get a job if there is a person that is better than you? If they received an easier problem? A better interviewer? So many factors in play and luck is a huge part in the entire process. I can give you a question that you have never seen and have no idea how to solve and give another candidate a level order binary tree question. All I am saying is don’t go about saying “there is no reason you shouldn’t be able to get a job…” because you know you have been lucky to get the current job as well :)

You take a bad job until you get a good one. Some money is better than no money.

He's a CS major, it's one of the most lucrative degrees if not THE most lucrative. Cornell grads average like 100k right out of college.

That's not what entitlement means..

Stop focusing on the word “entitlement” and see the point. And yes, you are entitled to think you would get a job cuz its “hot market” and doesn’t understand people who don’t. Anyways, I may have overreacted because I have seen too many toxic ppl.



Ivy degree in a tough STEM subject … could easily parlay in data science , finance, engineering etc. EASILY!!





Dude. There's jobs everywhere now for that background. Even locally. I'd hurry though. Hiring freezes are on the winds.

Doesn't help CS majors with the increase in H-1B Visa[https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/05/07/dhs-welcome-indian-visa-workers/](https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/05/07/dhs-welcome-indian-visa-workers/)s.

You can still use Engineering Career Services/ university career services as an alumni! Give them a call!

If you're looking for the domain in embedded systems, hardware engineering or application software, the company I work at is hiring. I can provide a referral if you'd like.

If the reason is no interviews : Don’t be picky and apply to 200+ places.  Get referrals to all of the places you are applying to.  Getting a top tech job is 10X harder then a random ass company that doesn’t pay close to as much, so start at the bottom and work your way up. 



If it’s a low conversion rate on the interviews, try to make sure you know exactly what the company is looking for and talk about that.  Make sure you can do a lot of LC for practice and explain your thought process simply.

Make a twitter account

for more specific guidance:



look at companies you’re interested in, then look at people



if you have cornell as a school on your linkedin, you can see people who also went to cornell



look for job titles that seem the most similar to what you’re interested in doing, and reach out to them

Cornell has an extensive alumni network.

Agreed. 



Yes, but as a very recent graduate they may be willing to help and have a vested interest in helping OP. Not like they've been alumni for that long. It's worth a try, is what I'm saying.

How to Enjoy Reading Again



How do I get back to enjoying reading? Help!

I’ve been trying to get back into reading as well, so I feel your struggle!



Some advice that I’ve heard before is if you’re having a hard time committing to new books, try rereading one that you’ve already gone through before. You already know that it will be good going into it, and it will likely remind you why you enjoyed reading so much in the first place!

Vouch for this series

You should also read "Ball Lightning" from the same author.

Find a really good book and just try to read a little each day. Over winter break I read the three-body trilogy and the second book blew my mind. That really helped me have fun while reading again

Put ur phone away while ur reading, find a nice spot outdoors to read, find a book thats very captivating, maybe a mystery or something light to get back into it at first

It took me about two years after graduating to be able to enjoy books again. I kept having to remind myself that it was okay not to have to understand everything 100%, or to be able to write some well written analysis. Just had to relearn how to enjoy reading.

Don’t have any pressure to completely finish a book! I tend to take a long time to read because I get pressured to follow along every detail, but unless you skip over entire chapters you’re not going to miss the overall story / themes. Good books are meant to be reread, and that will just make the second time reading more enjoyable!

It’s hard! I love talking to people about what I’m reading and hearing about what others are reading—find a friend to catch up with about books and it might motivate you to read, not a certain amount, but to remember and learn something to share with someone else :)

Getting an audio book does wonders

I just got back into reading!!!! I use Apple Books cuz it keeps a reading streak and a reading goal and it’s super available and nice— when I don’t have service I’ll just whip it out and read for 20 mins. I also find talking about the books ur reading is super helpful too— PM me if you want a book buddy to talk about it with!!

For me personally, I had a phase where I was rlly into reading science/philosophy books and it rlly killed my enjoyment of reading.. since getting back into it I’ve exclusively been reading fiction and it’s amazing.. so ya I’d hard reccomend fiction of all kinds

I started this summer with the intent of getting back into reading as well! I just looked up books recommended by other people in my favorite genres... if you like murder mysteries, Agatha Christie is one of the best (Murder on the Orient Express) and I read somewhere that her book And Then There Were None was pretty great, and it was! I could not put it down, read it in a day (and I'm no book worm or anything), it was so engaging... I mean, trying to figure out who was behind all of the murders?? Always a good time... but yeah anyways, finding a genre you like and just looking up books that other people recommend is a good method I would say



If you tell me what books you’ve liked in the past I can give you some recommendations

Honestly me too. My friends really like reading, so they've pressured me into finishing a book recently, and ever since, it's become significantly easier for me to read for fun (I've read more for fun in the past 2 weeks than in the past 2 years). I don't know if this will help you, but if you want to buddy-read something, I'm willing to do it with you!

The problem might be a little harder to attack than previous suggestions. there have been a lot of papers, articles, and studies on this. Because we live in a more digital age, and being in college your most likely spending a lot more time in front of a computer and your phone... These devices, websites such as youtube, twitter, etc,etc, are built in a way to redirect your brain to receive quick dopamine hits, with the shortest route. Your brain is subconsciously addicted to receiving information like that. The fix is really boring, tedious, and difficult. You basically need to remove as much screen time from your days as possible, while substituting it with books. its  a slow process that could take months to repair.  I personally have been extremely aware of the causes of our media, and so I put a lot of restrain on myself when using my phone. I only have it with me when im expecting calls. I often have it on silent. Its never near my dinner table, bed, or garage where I spend ( me time ). I absolutely love all things tech and have been need deep in a lot of complex tech hobbies, but Ive always been disciplined and use it as a tool, and never let it control me.  This is how Ive managed to still read thick, dense, complex books over the years. I hope that helps, and good luck!

Is it worth it using the Cornell gyms

The Cornell gyms are more than enough to get into shape

Less crowded in summer



Happy to start one if there isn't one already. (:





Please be honest . . . will these classes inundate me with so many time-consuming problem sets that I won't have much of a life during my very first semester of college? I would like to make friends and do things that **don't** involve studying. And my goal is **not** to get A+, A+, and A+. Decent grades are fine.



Would it be better to take 2 of those 3 classes instead? Your advice is much appreciated.

These are very basic intro classes and not a very intense schedule you will be 100% fine. They are also all stuff offered in high school so I’d imagine u have some background in them

There are GPA and curricular requirements you have to meet. If they weren't in the email, you should be able to find them online for your specific Cornell college.

Median grades

Does anybody know when median grades are supposed to come out? I checked earlier today and they didn't seem to be there on my transcript, but I thought the deadline was today.

Last time I believe they started showing up on transcripts at 2:00 PM. Where did you hear that they would appear today?

Just somewhere on this reddit lol, guess I can't trust that too much.

Summer sublet (2 bed 1 bath)

Hey everyone,



I'm looking to sublet a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment in Collegetown Center anytime from June 29th to August 19th. It's right across from Jack's and is only a few minutes from the engineering quad. Both rooms are available (you can take one or both), and rent is negotiable. Pm for more details!

Hello, I have a rougher sem coming up and I'd like to study up a little for BIOMG 3300, what textbooks were used and does anyone have any advice on how to pre study the material a little?

Tbf, no one knows for sure. Blankenship is retiring I think, so the class is being taught by someone else for the first time. The curriculum could be entirely revamped.

Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry

>Blankenship



Do you remember what the textbook was called?

Lehninger 7th edition I believe

My Senior Year Grades

Hi everyone, 



I know you all hate the posts about people in fear of getting rescinded and all, but I am actually failing a course at my school. In this class I had a 96 average my first quarter, then an 89, 85, and now it is a 65. My grade in the course is the average of only 4 assignments given to us this quarter, and the final which counts as 20 percent. Assuming I do well on the final I can bring up this grade to maybe a C- at the most, but it could very possibly be a D. 



I see all over this sub that people have to stop worrying about Bs and Cs, as long as there are no Ds/Fs. But I am one of those people with a D. I reached out to the school I was admitted to in order to discover if this drop in this one class is significant enough to cause me to be rescinded, however they have yet to get back to me, and I'm not sure they are even able to answer that for me. 





I could really use some help. Thank you so much in advance everyone <3

Do you have a conditional acceptance? Then maybe worry



If not, don’t worry. Seriously . Live your life this summer and Ithaca will welcome you soon :)

where can i get a huge box to ship a chair

it’s a nice office/desk chair… uhaul doesn’t have premade boxes and id like to avoid DIYing a box if i can

FYI, most chairs can be partially disassembled which will reduce the size of the box needed by a factor of 2 or 3. 



If you put a chair in the smallest cube it'll fit in, most of the cube will just be air. And you're paying for that volume.

Uncle Marty's

Sell the chair?  My son is actually looking for a task/gaming chair.

are you pretty much in as long as you do the course requirements and have a good GPA? Or do they care a lot about the essay and ecs?

I thought there was an essay that showed continued interest? I think they said something about that on the webinar in May

oo this is based on how TO worked back in 2017/2018, ig theyve updated the process

youre pretty much in as long as you meet course reqs and the gpa requirements - theres no essay for TOs and the application itself is quite straightforward, only rly requiring personal info like your address and name

oo this is based on how TO worked back in 2017/2018, ig theyve updated the process

does anyone know where i can get a big box pls

i need to ship my chair, dimensions 38.75" H 30" W 18.5" D and I’d like to avoid DIYing a box lol

A Big Box Store like Home Depot or Lowe's?

FedEx has those large moving boxes that should fit that. I think their XL moving box will do

Official Transcript for Internships

Student essentials -> order transcript -> Internship email -> sent out

Never had anyone ask, but I’ve only interned at startups. Maybe larger corporations would care enough to check.

Deloitte

Update: thank you to all for your support. I have received so many kind words and very helpful legal advice. As much as I have felt this person has ruined my life, I am more than a victim and they will absolutely get what’s coming to them. Thank you all, again. It means so much to me

Firstly: I am so sorry that you were harmed by this individual. Please don't be afraid or ashamed to seek help from Cornell Health or use [this link](https://titleix.cornell.edu/reporting/) to find resources that can help you.



As a moderator of this subreddit, I understand why you might want to dox this person. We've recently hit 43k subscribers, giving any post you make a wide reach. However, doxxing this person on r/Cornell unfortunately not work. Here are the reasons why:



1) Reddit does not allow doxxing. [Please refer to this post for more information.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) Doing so could see you banned from Reddit entirely, which is an action taken by Reddit admins and is not something we have control over.



2) It goes against r/Cornell policy. Because of previous issues with doxxing, we have historically prohibited direct references (names, email addresses, etc.) to non-public individuals on the subreddit. If the person in question is a public individual (ex. a professor, an administrator, a high-profile person), that is another story.



3) Any legal action you may decide to take could be hindered by releasing the person's information. I won't pretend to be a law student, but it's common knowledge not to reveal sensitive information online because it can jeopardize the case you are potentially trying to build. You want to give yourself the best shot at obtaining some form of justice. Of course, this assumes that you're thinking about reporting the crime and are able to do so. If you're not or you can't, I understand. Regardless, the previous points apply.



I have seen other individuals start awareness campaigns on Instagram, for example. If you're comfortable with sharing some details there, that may be something you can look into. I personally know many of my friends would be happy to help pass the information along. I'm very sorry we cannot be of more assistance on r/Cornell. No matter what you choose to do, you have our support.



 As someone else said, the official report can then be released.  If this person is financially powerful (rich parents) and you are not, they could make your life miserable if you accuse them of something without it having been documented.  



I am sorry you had this happen to you.  They need to held accountable for their actions against you, to warn others about them, and so there is a record.

No, instead report them to the authorities

Temporarily feeling better about yourself <<<<< long term solution



What is the benefit you gain by doxxing? If you do dox, you lose the legal upper hand you currently have. Your assault may be difficult to prove in court, if you dox them that's not really arguable.

I’m very sorry that this happened — I can only imagine how terrible this must feel. I hope that you’re able to find sympathy and peace, and if there’s anything we (the members of r/Cornell) can do for you, don’t hesitate to let us know. We’re here for you.





You should call the police immediately, and file a formal police report. There are advocacy hotlines you can call, as well as Cornell’s Title IX office. They take these things very seriously. 





While I most definitely don’t have any sympathy for those who assault, I don’t see what there is to gain by doxxing him here. It’s fine by me if you do it, of course, but you’re risking a ban from Reddit/this sub and other potential unforeseen consequences if he decides to pursue some type of action (as messed up as that would be).

No. Go to the police if you were assaulted. 



Also, have you considered that the consequences of doing this (especially after inquiring about doing it online) could implicate you in all kinds of legal trouble? What if someone were to use that information to target their family and harass them too? What if they or their family/friends retaliate?



I don't know what happened to you but its better to do things the right way. Go and file a report as soon as possible with the evidence and information you have or go straight to local PD.

The benefit of doxxing them, besides retaliation, is warning other students and potentially preventing more future victims. That's a pretty significant upside.



If you pressed charges in a criminal sense, then post the arrest blotter. If sent through Cornell's system, it's still considered a private matter.



If by dox you mean publicly revealing their name, then maybe.  Depends on the situation but I’d strongly consider other options first.



Do it. At Starbucks we have a customer who was outed as a rapist but corporate would not let us ban him. So we had to serve them over and over, he even came in yesterday.



Someone who assaulted you will assault someone else. I understand it is scary and a lot of people here have money to shut people up but fuck them. 



I'm sorry that happened to you



Dont lose your legal standing for some temporary strike-back. Take that fuck to court

You assaulted me. I’m going to doxx you

Yes

Go to authorities. You could be liable for severe civil penalties otherwise.

Do collage couples have to break up after graduation? We love each other but live in different countries



you can always get married and then one of you moves abroad lol

In a collage, you're together forever.

Never break up a collage

The internet exists in a way that allows people to meet while they’re in different countries and fall in love online. If people can do that, surely you can maintain a relationship online. But it only works if there’s an end goal. If there’s no finish line, there is no point in continuing like this

No, you’re not legally obligated to break up after uni. It’s quite libertarian, actually. You should name your future kid Ron Paul.

Lots of people break up, plenty don't. I've been married to the person I met at Cornell for a few years now. 



Yes, those couples have a hard time once they move to different countries as you make new friends and want to include their photos, but to your significant other the friends just seem like strangers. Also it’s tough deciding who ultimately keeps the collage. So better to nip it in the bud.

No. Joann’s probably has the right type of glue.

My perspective was that I would be really angry with myself if I didn't at least try long distance with my girlfriend. Has been almost a year doing long distance (granted still within the US, 10hr drive or 2hr plane ride) and I am so happy! I love her so much and am so glad she is in my life. Yes, long distance can be tough, but it can definitely be worth it for the right person! Good luck!

I think you should have a healthy conversation with your partner. Not Reddit...

Hello! I dated and am still with my boyfriend from Cornell. I moved to Boston post graduation for work and we chose to make the distance work — within the states though, so I understand it’s very different for you. Other commenters are right in that the best thing is to have an end date for the distance in sight. You both have to be willing to make sacrifices to make things work — I quit my job that kept me in Boston, and got one that was remote to make the move with him when he graduated this past May. We also made sure to plan regular visits and to always know when the next time we would see each other was. It’s definitely a hard decision to make, but I wish you the best of luck!

An LDR destroyed my mental health.



EDIT:  To expand on this.  The LDR lasted a year and the damage has taken over 10 to start to feel like it has started healing.  Not recommended.

I have never been in a long distance relationship, but I know people who have, and it seems tough. Most cases seem to end in messy break ups. It might be better to break up now congruently while staying friends on good terms. Then who knows, maybe one day life will lead you back into each other’s arms. 



Alternatively, tie the knot, or try to move to your SO’s country (or vica versa). If you plan to try to do this asap, I wouldn’t break up. Otherwise, I would. But that’s just me.

Not necessarily, if you're able to communicate really well and make the distance work. That said, it will be challenging, but not necessarily relationship-ending. A final consideration: a relationship doesn't have to result in marriage or last forever in order to be successful. Life circumstances change, sometimes to the degree that relationships change (e.g., maybe you downgrade to being friends). That's okay! It's not failure, and it allows you to still treasure what you got out of that period of your life and hold onto that connection, albeit in a different form.

If you have to ask…

It's really hard to say. I met my current girlfriend as seniors at Cornell in 2020 (right around when COVID started) and we've had to do long-distance since. I'm now doing grad school in the states while she's working in her country (13 hr timezone diff). We just met again in person for the first time since spring 2020 this past week and it was amazing. I think with things like video calling, streaming, online games, etc., long-distance is more manageable. However, we did have many, many ups and downs over the past 2+ years which the distance only made worse. Hopefully it can work out, but like another person said, this is really something you need to discuss with your partner. I'm rooting for you!

Quick, both of you should apply to grad school there and ask the ombudsman to help. 



Make a movie going forward. 



Post haste.

Only do it if there is a plan to be in the same place together soon. Otherwise, I highly do not recommend.

If your graduating and want a long term relationship why wouldn’t you move in together? One of you has to start the immigration process asap.

In a collage, you're together forever.

TA for PLBIO 2400?

Has anyone been a TA for PLBIO 2400? How was it? What was the median grade (A or A+?)





sorry, I realize it doesn’t say in the post, but I haven’t sent in the deposit yet. my question was more “do I email it and get it changed or just send in the full amount as specified in the lease”

Have you paid the last months' rent, but not the security deposit? Or you haven't paid either one yet?



Either way, this does give you some more leverage... because you could just pay the deposit but not last month's rent (as it should be) and email them a link to the relevant law, which I think you can find on NY State's government website. You can just say "Since the law only allows one months' equivalent of a deposit to be held, " (or whatever it actually says--don't quote me here)  "I'm including the maximum deposit that is legally allowed."





If you refuse to pay the "full" deposit, the landlord *could* also just say that they're not going to rent to you, on the basis that you've already broken the terms of their lease by refusing to pay the "full" (illegally high) deposit as you already agreed to in the lease. That would be a dumb move on their part because it's pretty close to the start of the lease and they may not find another tenant. They might also be breaking the law even more if they do this--but if they already did so once, maybe they just don't care. If this happens, you're probably not going to bother suing them, and you might be stuck trying to find another place last-minute. So, there's some risk in that.

I think you summed it up pretty well in the second paragraph.



Your new landlord is doing something illegal (they can argue, but this isn't really up for debate) which resulted in a moderate inconvenience to you, but no real danger.



Do they know that what they're doing is illegal? It's hard to say. Maybe they don't have a care for the law and they know that what they're doing is blatantly illegal. Or maybe they're just oblivious to the new law (which only took effect about 2 years ago--or two "lease cycles" ago) or they've heard of it but they genuinely don't think it applies in this case.



What you do should mostly depend on your assessment of the above (is it a small family business? Is it a large corporate landlord?) and, like you said, weighing the convenience of getting a month's worth of rent back to hold onto versus risking upsetting your new landlord.



If it's a small "family business"-type landlord, it's probably worth kindly letting them know about the new law and linking to a credible source or two, *even just for their sake,* because sooner or later someone else will actually get them in serious legal trouble over it. These smaller landlords often stand to lose more from violating the law and they will likely do what's needed (give you back a month's rent) in order to be in compliance. There is, of course, still a risk that you'll upset them by doing this--but risk that can't be avoided.



If it's a rather large corporate landlord then they almost certainly know that what they're doing is wrong, but they just don't care. In this case, it's really just a question of getting the money back v.s. not getting on their bad side, nothing else. You know, and they *probably* know, that you're not going to sue them over this. After a few emails they might grudgingly give the money back, or call your bluff and hold onto it unless you offer a credible threat of legal action--at which point you're absolutely getting on their bad side.

I had the same issue once. The law changed in 2019 to have stronger limits.  Once i brought it up the landlord agreed to change it in a very chill manner. I think sometimes they are too lazy to update their amounts and most people just pay it. It’s not always out if bad intent. But if you tell them they kindof have to agree, otherwise they are doing something illegal.

I suggest contacting the [Ithaca Tennant’s Union](https://www.ithacatu.org/)

They can advise on approaching this and let you know if things like are common with this landlord

Help Choosing Winter Socks

Hey everyone!



I am a '26 looking to buy my winter clothes for ithaca. I am currently trying to choose what socks to get as I've heard its rly important to have thick warm socks. For reference in terms of shoes, I am currently deciding between a more insulated LL bean duck boot and a less insulated timberland boot.



I was wondering if you guys had any recs for socks to help me survive the ithaca winter as I come from a warm climate lol



Thanks :)

I definitely agree with this. My family stressed about winter and over bought gloves and hats. As long as you make use of the buses and plan to not be outside too often, you only need to buy a good coat.

Which coat? How many layers do you wear?

Tbh I'm fine with a Columbia omni-heat jacket and a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath. Columbia has pretty good sales online or at an outlet mall if you can get to one. If it's extra chilly/windy I'll also wear a sweatshirt. I'll also recommend layering pants if it's windy. Fleece-lined leggings or sweatpants are godsends. Having lived through many upstate NY and New England winters, the cold isn't too bad. It's the wind that really sucks.

With a Canada Goose, I only wear the coat and a tshirt and find this very comfortable.

Yeah, the wind blows through my sweatpants and I can feel it on my legs. Wtf how is that even possible.  



>Fleece-lined leggings or sweatpants are godsends.



Um do I have the crappy quality sweatpants then. I get them from Uniqlo.



And just 2 layers?! I'm freezing with 3/4. That jacket must be SUPER good.

some people cannot afford a canada goose honey…..

Honestly, people kinda over hype Ithaca winters. I wore normal socks 99% of the time, and I never lost any digits or anything. I’d just get a couple pairs of wool socks to wear on really cold days.

Vermonter here, your boots are 10x more important for keeping your feet warm compared to socks. 



As long as you don’t wear crocs and run into a pile of snow you should be fine.



Maybe wear two pairs of regular socks if you’re particularly sensitive to the cold.

this was the brand recommended when my pe class went ice climbing. darn tough socks are wool and high quality -- wool is known to be really good insulators and keep you warm when cold and cool when warm.

I would say darn tough socks work in summer and winter both

Don't squish your feet is rule number one. No circulation= extra cold feet. Get boots a little larger than normal shoes and wear a light to medium sock of wool or wool poly blend, you'll be fine. You aren't likely outside for long stretches so honestly if you have footwear that keeps your feet dry that is more important than warmth per se. Good waterproof boots or shoes with treads that will allow you to walk on ice or snow will be the best. Socks matter much less as long as you have socks that cover your ankles.



If you want specific sock recommendations for winter darn tough and smart wool are fabulous. I use them for super cold days or when I need to be outside more than 20 min at a stretch.

As a minnesotan, I can say Ithaca winters are nothing crazy. I'd just wear 2 pairs of socks when it's cold and get a snow boot of your choice.

Wool socks

Echoing some other comments, I've personally found that good shoes make more of a difference than good socks.



Socks matter mostly in situations where snow or cold rain gets into your shoes somehow. **If you're regularly getting your socks wet while wearing shoes, then yes, you want to pick your socks carefully**\--for instance, pick wool socks rather than cotton ones (as a saying goes among winter hikers and mountain climbers, "cotton kills") and there's a bunch more nuanced advice to be found in this regard.



But then again, **if you're regularly getting your socks wet while wearing shoes, then you're likely doing something wrong.** Get a good pair of insulated, waterproof or water resistant shoes. If there's a lot of snow to the point where it's falling down into your shoes, around your ankles (and this only happens 3x or 4x a winter) then get winter pants that you can stretch over the top inch or two of your shoes to avoid that. And now that your feet are no longer getting wet, your socks really don't matter that much for regular use. As long as you're not trying to camp outdoors, hike a mountain, etc., anything decently thick will do.

Any wool socks should do, hiking ones can be multi purpose too

Get smartwool socks, they're the best.

Lol I don’t know a single person who wears winter socks. Just wear ur normal socks dude you’ll be fine

Don’t worry so much about your socks. Worry about your boots.

Yea the thing is that I'd usually take the bus but I have an irritatingly large number of bags to carry.

rent a car it is cheaper

And if you can’t drive/rent a car, put your stuff in boxes and ship them. Might still be cheaper.

June 10-14 is cornell reunion for a lot of alumni. Ask for a ride.

I’ve seen people bring 4 or 5 bags on an ourbus when it is totally full. There is plenty of room in the storage underneath.

how much money are you willing to spend lmao

Yes they go there but the best way to go about it is to find someone who drives uber and offer to pay them independently of the app. I have gotten it down to $200 and then we split it three ways and he drove us at like 3 am when no buses were available. As for having so much luggage, I would consider making a deeper life decision about living a more minimal life and consider what is important and donate the rest of the stuff. For example everything I own can be packed into two Ikea bags. It freed up my anxiety and decluttered my mind. Think about the things you really need in life as excess just makes moving harder and harder. I travelled for months with just a backpack and was able to wear clean socks and underwear everyday because I would go find a laundromat. The thing that saved me the most space was donating my books and getting a library card.

Im an incoming transfer student. If I remember correctly when I toured you had to pay extra to use the gym on campus. Is that still the policy, and is the facility worth paying for?

You do have to pay. IMO its not really worth paying for but it ends up being way cheaper than any of the off-campus gyms if thats your alternative

Was there adequate equipment such as benches, squat racks, free weights etc? Also what hours is the traffic at the gym lowest?

I used to go to teagle down and noyes at odd hours and it was pretty lit.

You do have to pay. For most people, it ends up being the best option in Ithaca. If you have a car, you could probably go to the off campus gyms, but the on campus ones are cheaper+more convenient. Just like most gyms it gets busy at peak hours but it is usually pretty nice.

Latest TCAT runs?

Unfortunately bus summer schedules are limited. If possible, see if you can get out 5-8 minutes before the last bus so that you dont run into issues. Hopefully your supervisors are understanding.

incoming PSSP students !! ask questions in this thread.

so they don’t let you work/get a job they make u focus on classes. your advising Dean picks your classes. I had a intro stats class, a first year writing seminar, and a study skills class (that most PSP students were in). pretty chill. other than that, you learn campus, spend time with friends, do activities, it’s like a summer camp meets a college semester. you’re basically starting your freshman year with a summer term.

it depends on what ur admissions letter says. if it says “conditional” then basically you have to go if you want to go to cornell. if it’s giving you an option to apply, that means it’s optional and has no impact on your admissions. mine was conditional/mandatory. but dw it’s worth it. cornell will pay for your travel expenses, too.

hi!! thank you so much for doing this. i’m attending pssp this summer and have several questions in mind because anxiety and i’m just that type of person. would it be alright to dm you with them? thanks again!

i was a kid in psp too last year and if you have the space to take a mattress topper back home after the program ends sure! if you don’t, wait until the school year starts. it depends on the classes u have and how you’re able to exercise your time management skills - i often went to college town w new friends to drink boba or starbucks or take walks around campus! some kids did go to the movies too.  keep in mind that you will have a curfew, which differ from the weekdays and weekends. and you’re not allowed to bring a car to campus so you’re gonna have to resort to the ithaca taxi service(ur not supposed to use Uber or Lyft) or buses (it’s free)

I spent a decent amount outside but it’s more of how you choose to spend your money on random things. I think I spent like $200-$300 ish out of pocket ? (graduation gift cards and stuff). I personally don’t think you need a mattress topper, but if you get here and prefer one you can always order one or go to target nearby :)

don’t worry. i was the same way, but then I made the best friends I’ll make at cornell. this program helped me so much. the nerves are normal. also feel free to knock on my door, my name is daniela and I’ll be the activities coordinator :)

Did you have to spend a lot of money on outside expenses or excursions like say if you wanted to go to the movies or whatever? Did you have a lot of time for stuff like that? Also, do you recommend taking a mattress topper?

Pls help starbucks college ave workers

Starbucks is literally ✨union-busting✨ and shutting down the COLLEGE AVE STARBUCKS. This store is high-volume and has nothing to do with revenue/customers. Not only that, but management has avoided saying whether the workers (the ones that unionized!) will be relocated to a different location. Of course, they did this when students are gone for the summer so not many students can physically help protest, but please help this gain traction.



https://preview.redd.it/viqo0zfehn391.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=169e4d4a9031861933ec3cfffe1448a275e923f6

also just a fun fact, the workers were told they were getting shut down yesterday, and it will be permanently closed in ONE WEEK from yesterday

Boycott them, and encourage others to do them. Losing revenue is much more meaningful than a few mean comments on their twitter.

The venn diagram of girls who love faux social activism and girls who drink starbucks is a circle. Good luck with that

If theyre shutting down what will boycotting it do

People won’t follow through. They have too long been conditioned to take what these corporate entities give them without complaint and besides  how will they ever live without their grande mocha iced lattes??

How can we help?

Particularly when there are some national award winning local roasters right here in Ithaca that cornell can sell instead

Mannible serves (at least last time I was there) coffee from Gimmee!  My regular daily coffee is usually from Copper Horse.  The other one I often have is from Wegmans.

starbucks coffee is also worse than peets and copper horse by a lot. and copper horse is local

I guarauntee you 90% of students could not give the slightest fuck. You may see your cause as noble, but the world runs on money and satisfaction, not moral righteousness.

It closed, now the corp that runs the dining halls has that space and it sucks.

Why is it illegal to close the store?

I posted earlier that this is exactly what would happen. They would close the store, wait several years and reopen it.



To all the workers getting laid off bc of these corporate pussies:



I see in the you the strongest and smartest people who've ever lived. I see all this potential and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation making coffee, waiting tables, slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. 



We're the middle children of the history man, no purpose or place. We have no Great war, no Great depression - our great war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives.



Edit: I mixed up the two stores. Hope the downtown store stay intact.

Covid has been around for 2 years and this is not the first summer during covid. Last summer the store did not shut down and the summer before the store did not shut down, so what makes this one different?

What you're suggesting is that there's a decent chance that SBUX decided to close this location because they think that in whatever time-frame is relevant to them they'll have net losses or that the resources being used there could make more money elsewhere. I highly doubt that location has anything even remotely close to net losses, so even with whatever the union wrangles it's very unlikely that that location will be anything but a regular net gain. As for the option of using the resources to open a location elsewhere, that could be the case, but again, I doubt that long-term the gains of where ever the resources of this closed location go will make more than this location. There are multiple SBUX locations in smaller and/or less rich college towns across the US (e.g. Normal, IL and DeKalb, IL) that have maintained their locations. If the choice isn't due to the net the location is making, then it's just a clear case of SBUX corporate bringing down the anti-labor hammer, possibly at their own expense.

the high speed (combi) ovens they use to warm sandwiches are notorious for producing lots of grease.

my point is surrounding compounding issues. that covid has been impacting the revenue for longer than just this spring semester only goes to evidence the potential instability of income. That store could even be breaking even, but has value in maintaining the Starbucks name at a popular location amongst younger patrons (who will presumably go on to make enough money to sustain regular coffee purchases down the road)... it could even run at a slight deficit. But now with the strike thrown into the mix and potential company perception that the union cant really be worked with at an acceptable level, they bail.



my only point is that their goal is to make money, not to spite random workers in Ithaca. They would only shut down an operation if their cost/benefit analysis indicated that it was an appropriate decision going forward given the environment that particular property rests in.

dunno why my expressing a slightly controversial opinion in a relatively cordial manner invites comments like this. If you want to be rude, be rude... but understand that viewpoints like mine are like those that exist in the majority of people, that one (presumably you) who supports the unionized employees of Starbucks might want to reach.



People who support them are fewer in number, and this movement will only get steam by reaching out and showing a reason to care. If your goal is to disparage those who earnestly respond to an issue in a with no indication of disrespect, you're doing a disservice to those you probably support.

Ah, ok... Previous occupant's grease trap makes sense.



A latte and onion rings would be...odd.

Homie your vague remembrance could have been helped by a [quick Reddit search](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/u53p1x/collegetown_starbucks_is_on_strike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or by supporting the Starbucks workers when they spoke on campus, where the store manager described the grease trap in such vivid detail that they cut themself off because they grossed out the crowd ([link to recording](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/events/moment-movement-starbucks-and-slow-drip-starting-union)). 

Bottom line, it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that you, an outsider, assume you have better view of the situation than the workers who are in the store every day. Sbucks union busting is notorious and highly documented, if you watch the workers talk in the above link. Get off your high and mighty stool and actually listen to what the workers are saying, even if you’re not going to support.

What about the unionized Starbucks popping up around the country? You don’t think that anti-union Starbucks would shut down a location to make an example? Regardless, with the margins that Starbucks makes on those drinks (50 cents for a little bit of oat milk…) and the volume of orders that they get from Cornell students in Ctown, even with a union there is no way that that Starbucks is going under. I think you lack a sense of the bigger picture here. There are definitely reasons that Starbucks would shut down beyond a pure cost benefit analysis

Oh my gosh that was aggressive.





There is no high horse commentary... just a desire for a more complete approach to the issue beyond just "they don't fix grease trap, we strike, they shut the store down". This is not something that really anybody can form an opinion on in a vacuum, and asking people to rise up based on that narrative alone isn't in good faith.



What I do know is that I (hopefully) am a reasonable person who falls into an educated group of people, who has a particular outlook on things. That outlook is a similar one to many: detached from this problem. Im merely speaking to what i would expect, just like many others would expect as well, as somebody who does not have a lot of impetus to be informed.



I'm a molecular biology major, I don't follow this. This issue does not fit into my sphere of interest of things that I would pursue independently... and I'm not the only one who is like this. Thus if I express that a particular issue doesn't appear intuitive, the goal shouldn't be to talk me down, but perhaps inform me or onlookers. 



Aside from all of that, nothing I've said has actually been refuted. The closest thing to refuting what I've said is your statement regarding margins that Starbucks makes x y and z, vs what they pay.... but we don't know that do we? We done have the numbers... if we do that would be an important thing to share. Everything that I've been told so far revolves around what people think happens, and what somebody said something looks like.  So a reasonable person who is apprehensive about such things is berated by various people on an online forum because they want something more concrete to hold onto? Where that more concrete thing to hold onto would be an avenue for not just me but for other people to use as a reason to support this initiative?



This whole thread is disappointing to me...

It seems like you’re using “detached from the problem” as a synonym for uneducated. You don’t know anything about these issues but are speaking in a way as to claim the people who are actually educated about them are wrong. You also have no way to know you represent the majority opinion.

detached from the problem, much like many problems, is generally the nature of the masses. Its not simply that i am uneducated about the nature of starbuck's attitude towards unionizing and how that affects the particularities here in ithaca (a pretty esoteric thing to be aware of, certainly if one finds themself in stem). Thats not to say these things are mutually exclusive, i may be uneducated as well... but thats not the point.



What i am doing is speaking to things in a way that a reasonable person might be skeptical of a given assertion. This does not mean that i am saying what IS.... rather that i cant but sure that what another says IS. I am not claiming anybody is wrong btw... i have been asking for something concrete all throughout this thread.



I dont even plan on being pedantic about a very vague figure... all i would want is something specific regarding this starbucks and how it interfaces with what is currently being seen. An employee in the know could probably do a bit of legwork and have gotten some info from the manager well before this blew up regarding revenue and pricing and blah blah blah. My point is that nobody is producing these things, and yet people feel super comfortable about shouting union busting.



Youre right, i have no way to know i represent the majority opinion... just a strong inkling given what we know about public sentiment in general. Never mind that if i didn't represent the majority opinion, the corollary would be that more than half of the Cornell student body is aware of, is educated in the intricacies of, and supportive of this issue regarding the college town Starbucks. Now if you're going to make that claim, then idk what do do after that. 



Regardless, its a relatively intuitive idea, I think, to suppose that supporters who are passionate about a given issue are a lot more vocal than people who are unaware of said issue. Thus, while it may appear to be very popular issue, the majority opinion is unclear. One way to show this would be just looking at the last presidential election, where more people voted than ever before... yet that amounted to 40% of the country. That 40% was very polarized and loud, but certainly the majority of the country wasn't compelled enough to act. 



Again, please look, in good faith, at what I am saying without addressing some construct of what I appear to be because i skeptical or in opposition to a given viewset. I am merely voicing my opinion and looking to BE informed, and being as cordial as possible while being berated by various people for doing so.

It is not the job of the employees to educate you. You have the resources to educate yourself. Did you even watch the video that was linked?

again, i don't have any impetus to educate myself. This is the nature of people... i don't know how to express this any other way. If you are in such favor of an initiative that you with to promulgate it throughout your community, you don't put the ownership on various individuals who have never taken the time out of their day to look at these things. If one makes an assertion, the burden of proof is on them... and all of the impetus to give that proof is there too. How does regular Cornell student who can get coffee from 8 other places have any reason to look into this issue unless they are shown the issue.



This whole tangent isn't even relevant to the problem at hand, because I'm simply evidencing why the average person wont have it in there purview to take action about this particular thing out of thin air. My whole thing is hoping to find a solid piece of "this is what is happening and here is proof why Starbucks is just trash" and nothing I've been shown says that.



>  i don't have any impetus to educate myself



If you don't want to educate yourself, fine. But quit talking on this issue then. You've commented more than anyone else in this thread, despite claiming over and over that you don't want to educate yourself on this matter.

Dude that’s a really shitty argument. This doesn’t affect me so I have no incentive to educate myself on it? I drink coffee about twice a year, I go to Starbucks less than that. This shut down will not affect my life directly whatsoever but I recognise the bigger issue at hand, I’ve been provided the same info as you have. The hope is that people can care about things that don’t just concern them. I guess it’s fair to say that people don’t have the incentive to care and therefore wont but it’s a stupid argument to make. That’s what the point of these posts is? To try to get people to care? What exactly do you expect them to do?

Probably going to be an unpopular take, but I wish somebody that was a part of this strike initiative to be more vocal and provide alot more visual evidence regarding the extent of the perceived damage of the grease trap. It's really hard to believe that this issue, coupled with general disgruntlement, would really justify a strike. Rather simply notifying a local authorities regarding food safety, or OSHA guidelines seems like that would be a good place to start without going nuclear. That said, it's unclear to what lengths they have gone to solve this issue.



Principally, the role of a union is not to wrest power and control from a company for its own sake, but provide an avenue in which employees under its umbrella feel as though they have negotiating agency and a well established line of communication. The problem is if you demonstrate that your union is willing to stop working on a dime and go nuclear for things that might not merit such a response, the company isn't exactly going to be inclined to continue that line of communication. Moreover, we know that this particular Starbucks makes most of its money at two different segments of time in the year, each lasting for 4.5 months. Deciding to impact the most lucrative month (after already having been impacted by covid restrictions) of the first 4.5 months of this year does not bode well in the corporate cost/benefit analysis of maintaining the property. Moreover, we have no idea what the property value/rental costs and operating costs on that Starbucks are... nevermind that a huge competitor (CTB) is closer in proximity to campus and is alot more popular. It's also unclear how the taxing works.



 Bottom line, It's a bit disingenuous, I think, to shout union busting when there are many factors that go into this issue and alot of the details aren't freely available. This isn't in defense of Starbucks per se, but apprehension that a company would simply shut its property down because they don't want to fix a grease trap. There has to be more details.

Lol over a grease trap ...

Context on the closure:



Back in early April, we won the entirety of Ithaca for the union in a landslide vote. At College Ave in particular, it was 19-1. One of the main reasons for our decision to organize back in the fall was the November bomb threat, where our manager at the time forced us to reopen because it was "JUST a bomb threat," not an active shooter threat (verbatim, isn't that awful?). Therefore, we unionized to have a say over the policies in our store, like for safety.









The NLRB has been made aware by our lawyers. We will continue to fight for our store to be reopened and its workers reinstated. However, this could take several months. Expect occasional updates on the matter.

My local Starbucks always followed local covid ordinances.  Whether one thought they were draconian or not wasn't cause to go full Karen on the baristas.



Believe it or not, I was successfully able to complete my coffee order with a mask on.

Unbelievably bad take

bro what are you talking about

Man you are one crazy dude

Russian troll account.

Lmao I love this comment

yea but I know it’s supposed to be an ivy and for some reason this post got recommended 2 me so slightly shocked idiots of this level exist in an Ivy too

It’s called legacy admissions

I’m first-gen and low income…

That’s hard to believe

No, it’s not.



Free market. People are desperate enough to work in shit conditions, workers with higher standards are passed over by companies in favour of those they can more easily take advantage of.





Edit: I say this as someone who 1. Works hard, 2. Job hunted exactly as you suggested. And guess what? I love the job I have now. It’s exactly what I want, because it serves the exact purpose I aim for it to fulfill. It also took months to secure. Months. There was a whole month I had no income, being in between starting this job and ending my previous. Why did I leave my previous jobs? Because they treated me like shit.





I’m making my reality as I envision it to be. I have goals. When I cut my tongue on my teeth advocating for my needs, ambition bleeds. But none of it has been easy. Nothing has been handed to me, not without me first searching or fighting for it.  So when you brush off real peoples real struggles, you only show how insular of a bubble you’ve been afforded to live in, thus far— or how internalized your apathy towards the economic plights of the non elite classes has become.

The venn diagram of girls who love faux social activism and girls who drink starbucks is a circle. Good luck with that

If theyre shutting down what will boycotting it do

People won’t follow through. They have too long been conditioned to take what these corporate entities give them without complaint and besides  how will they ever live without their grande mocha iced lattes??

Boycott them, and encourage others to do them. Losing revenue is much more meaningful than a few mean comments on their twitter.

Its not simply that i am uneducated about the nature of starbuck's attitude towards unionizing and how that affects the particularities here in ithaca (a pretty esoteric thing to be aware of, certainly if one finds themself in stem). Thats not to say these things are mutually exclusive, i may be uneducated as well... but thats not the point.



What i am doing is speaking to things in a way that a reasonable person might be skeptical of a given assertion. This does not mean that i am saying what IS.... rather that i cant but sure that what another says IS. I am not claiming anybody is wrong btw... i have been asking for something concrete all throughout this thread.



I dont even plan on being pedantic about a very vague figure... all i would want is something specific regarding this starbucks and how it interfaces with what is currently being seen. An employee in the know could probably do a bit of legwork and have gotten some info from the manager well before this blew up regarding revenue and pricing and blah blah blah. My point is that nobody is producing these things, and yet people feel super comfortable about shouting union busting.



Youre right, i have no way to know i represent the majority opinion... just a strong inkling given what we know about public sentiment in general. Never mind that if i didn't represent the majority opinion, the corollary would be that more than half of the Cornell student body is aware of, is educated in the intricacies of, and supportive of this issue regarding the college town Starbucks. Now if you're going to make that claim, then idk what do do after that. 



Regardless, its a relatively intuitive idea, I think, to suppose that supporters who are passionate about a given issue are a lot more vocal than people who are unaware of said issue. Thus, while it may appear to be very popular issue, the majority opinion is unclear. One way to show this would be just looking at the last presidential election, where more people voted than ever before... yet that amounted to 40% of the country. That 40% was very polarized and loud, but certainly the majority of the country wasn't compelled enough to act. 



Again, please look, in good faith, at what I am saying without addressing some construct of what I appear to be because i skeptical or in opposition to a given viewset. I am merely voicing my opinion and looking to BE informed, and being as cordial as possible while being berated by various people for doing so.

It is not the job of the employees to educate you. You have the resources to educate yourself. Did you even watch the video that was linked?

again, i don't have any impetus to educate myself. This is the nature of people... i don't know how to express this any other way. If you are in such favor of an initiative that you with to promulgate it throughout your community, you don't put the ownership on various individuals who have never taken the time out of their day to look at these things. If one makes an assertion, the burden of proof is on them... and all of the impetus to give that proof is there too. How does regular Cornell student who can get coffee from 8 other places have any reason to look into this issue unless they are shown the issue.



This whole tangent isn't even relevant to the problem at hand, because I'm simply evidencing why the average person wont have it in there purview to take action about this particular thing out of thin air. My whole thing is hoping to find a solid piece of "this is what is happening and here is proof why Starbucks is just trash" and nothing I've been shown says that.



>  i don't have any impetus to educate myself



If you don't want to educate yourself, fine. But quit talking on this issue then. You've commented more than anyone else in this thread, despite claiming over and over that you don't want to educate yourself on this matter.

Dude that’s a really shitty argument. This doesn’t affect me so I have no incentive to educate myself on it? I drink coffee about twice a year, I go to Starbucks less than that. This shut down will not affect my life directly whatsoever but I recognise the bigger issue at hand, I’ve been provided the same info as you have. The hope is that people can care about things that don’t just concern them. I guess it’s fair to say that people don’t have the incentive to care and therefore wont but it’s a stupid argument to make. That’s what the point of these posts is? To try to get people to care? What exactly do you expect them to do?

my point is surrounding compounding issues. that covid has been impacting the revenue for longer than just this spring semester only goes to evidence the potential instability of income. That store could even be breaking even, but has value in maintaining the Starbucks name at a popular location amongst younger patrons (who will presumably go on to make enough money to sustain regular coffee purchases down the road)... it could even run at a slight deficit. But now with the strike thrown into the mix and potential company perception that the union cant really be worked with at an acceptable level, they bail.



my only point is that their goal is to make money, not to spite random workers in Ithaca. They would only shut down an operation if their cost/benefit analysis indicated that it was an appropriate decision going forward given the environment that particular property rests in.

dunno why my expressing a slightly controversial opinion in a relatively cordial manner invites comments like this. If you want to be rude, be rude... but understand that viewpoints like mine are like those that exist in the majority of people, that one (presumably you) who supports the unionized employees of Starbucks might want to reach.



People who support them are fewer in number, and this movement will only get steam by reaching out and showing a reason to care. If your goal is to disparage those who earnestly respond to an issue in a with no indication of disrespect, you're doing a disservice to those you probably support.

yea but I know it’s supposed to be an ivy and for some reason this post got recommended 2 me so slightly shocked idiots of this level exist in an Ivy too

It’s called legacy admissions

I’m first-gen and low income…

That’s hard to believe

No, it’s not.

Free market. People are desperate enough to work in shit conditions, workers with higher standards are passed over by companies in favour of those they can more easily take advantage of.





Edit: I say this as someone who 1. Works hard, 2. Job hunted exactly as you suggested. And guess what? I love the job I have now. It’s exactly what I want, because it serves the exact purpose I aim for it to fulfill. It also took months to secure. Months. There was a whole month I had no income, being in between starting this job and ending my previous. Why did I leave my previous jobs? Because they treated me like shit.





I’m making my reality as I envision it to be. I have goals. When I cut my tongue on my teeth advocating for my needs, ambition bleeds. But none of it has been easy. Nothing has been handed to me, not without me first searching or fighting for it.  So when you brush off real peoples real struggles, you only show how insular of a bubble you’ve been afforded to live in, thus far— or how internalized your apathy towards the economic plights of the non elite classes has become.

People won’t follow through. They have too long been conditioned to take what these corporate entities give them without complaint and besides  how will they ever live without their grande mocha iced lattes??

Ah, ok... Previous occupant's grease trap makes sense.



A latte and onion rings would be...odd.

Oh my gosh that was aggressive.





There is no high horse commentary... just a desire for a more complete approach to the issue beyond just "they don't fix grease trap, we strike, they shut the store down". This is not something that really anybody can form an opinion on in a vacuum, and asking people to rise up based on that narrative alone isn't in good faith.

Homie your vague remembrance could have been helped by a [quick Reddit search](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/u53p1x/collegetown_starbucks_is_on_strike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or by supporting the Starbucks workers when they spoke on campus, where the store manager described the grease trap in such vivid detail that they cut themself off because they grossed out the crowd ([link to recording](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/events/moment-movement-starbucks-and-slow-drip-starting-union)). 

Bottom line, it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that you, an outsider, assume you have better view of the situation than the workers who are in the store every day. Sbucks union busting is notorious and highly documented, if you watch the workers talk in the above link. Get off your high and mighty stool and actually listen to what the workers are saying, even if you’re not going to support.



What I do know is that I (hopefully) am a reasonable person who falls into an educated group of people, who has a particular outlook on things. That outlook is a similar one to many: detached from this problem. Im merely speaking to what i would expect, just like many others would expect as well, as somebody who does not have a lot of impetus to be informed.



I'm a molecular biology major, I don't follow this. This issue does not fit into my sphere of interest of things that I would pursue independently... and I'm not the only one who is like this. Thus if I express that a particular issue doesn't appear intuitive, the goal shouldn't be to talk me down, but perhaps inform me or onlookers. 



Aside from all of that, nothing I've said has actually been refuted. The closest thing to refuting what I've said is your statement regarding margins that Starbucks makes x y and z, vs what they pay.... but we don't know that do we? We done have the numbers... if we do that would be an important thing to share. Everything that I've been told so far revolves around what people think happens, and what somebody said something looks like.  So a reasonable person who is apprehensive about such things is berated by various people on an online forum because they want something more concrete to hold onto? Where that more concrete thing to hold onto would be an avenue for not just me but for other people to use as a reason to support this initiative?



This whole thread is disappointing to me...

What about the unionized Starbucks popping up around the country? You don’t think that anti-union Starbucks would shut down a location to make an example? Regardless, with the margins that Starbucks makes on those drinks (50 cents for a little bit of oat milk…) and the volume of orders that they get from Cornell students in Ctown, even with a union there is no way that that Starbucks is going under. I think you lack a sense of the bigger picture here. There are definitely reasons that Starbucks would shut down beyond a pure cost benefit analysis

This shut down will not affect my life directly whatsoever but I recognise the bigger issue at hand, I’ve been provided the same info as you have. The hope is that people can care about things that don’t just concern them. I guess it’s fair to say that people don’t have the incentive to care and therefore wont but it’s a stupid argument to make. That’s what the point of these posts is? To try to get people to care? What exactly do you expect them to do?

It is not the job of the employees to educate you. You have the resources to educate yourself. Did you even watch the video that was linked?

No, it’s not.

again, i don't have any impetus to educate myself. This is the nature of people... i don't know how to express this any other way. If you are in such favor of an initiative that you with to promulgate it throughout your community, you don't put the ownership on various individuals who have never taken the time out of their day to look at these things. If one makes an assertion, the burden of proof is on them... and all of the impetus to give that proof is there too. How does regular Cornell student who can get coffee from 8 other places have any reason to look into this issue unless they are shown the issue.



This whole tangent isn't even relevant to the problem at hand, because I'm simply evidencing why the average person wont have it in there purview to take action about this particular thing out of thin air. My whole thing is hoping to find a solid piece of "this is what is happening and here is proof why Starbucks is just trash" and nothing I've been shown says that.

College of Engineering Prelaw

I always thought I wanted to do computer science. But, as I look at it more I realized it was just all for the money. I’m still fine with doing it of course , but I wanted to open the door to law , since debate has always been a passion of mine 



Are you doing stem , and if so , we’re you table to keep a high gpa ?

Im not stem, no. Im prelaw

Oh ok 👍 thanks for the advice

Ok I will

.... how was it like keeping your gpa high enough for law?

Gpa is not high

Ok I’ll keep 3.5 in mind as a borderline for me

This is interesting , I’ll definitely look at joining

I have no expertise on the engineering school in particular, so I can’t really answer your actual question. But you might be interested in the Speech and Debate society, where a lot of the people who graduate go to law school. Also, if you have an engineering background that might make you a good fit for intellectual property law, and a good story/pitch might help you overcome a lower GPA. Hope someone with more expertise also chimes in.

Thank you 😊

As far as I know, there is no prelaw major at Cornell, and -- frankly -- prelaw "majors" are a waste of time.   The content is indistinguishable from a government/polisci major, and doesn't place you in a position to do much if you choose a different path later on.





At your age, unless you have a parent who is a practicing lawyer, you have no idea what the practice of law is really like.  It's not wise to put all your chips on the square that you know little about.   Have a plan "B".

Hello all,



If anyone is interested in subletting an apartment (1 or 2 rooms) over the summer, let me know!

How to stop comparing myself with others?





I have a wide range of interest and is doing a double major and a minor. The consequence is, in each major I was outcompeted by people who concentrate on that field, and it seems inevitable. But how do I know what I'm really passionate about without devoting time for trials?



I understand I need a healthy mindset where I don't feel bad about myself or feel jealous about other people's success, but this is so much easier said than done. I can't help thinking what I could have done differently (like start looking for research earlier, not making careless mistakes in exams, and avoid those classes where I learned very few things).



Right now I'm overwhelmed by these feelings that I'm having a hard time concentrating on my life and study. I know I should quit self-pity and refocus. Writing on reddit will not likely resolve my problems, but I really need an outlet. Any suggestion/opinion is sincerely appreciated!

Compare yourself to me instead, I’m nowhere near that lol.



But as J cole said, there’s no such thing as the life that’s better than yours, no such thing as the life that’s better than yours, no such thing as the life that’s better than yours, no such thing, no such thing

wise words

Truly. Thanks for your words

Great comment.





Can't guarantee you'll get responses, but it's another avenue that might work out slightly better than trying to get a response out of a busy professor.

If you’re getting all As that’s a great place to be. A+s are pretty rare in a lot of classes (though perhaps not in your major, idk). In general, I think of an A+ as being a reward for someone who did something extra, and went above and beyond, and I don’t think many grad schools will care if you don’t have many (or any) A+s. If your goal is to enter a good PhD program, you’re on track.







In regards to your second to last paragraph: Hindsight is a bitch. I’ve been there and sometimes only time and further success can make you forget about your mistakes. That said, it does not seem like you have made any really big mistakes. Your goal is to get to grad school. Not to get the highest GPA or the most internships or the fewest mistakes on your exams. It’s grad schools. You’re thinking small picture; think big picture, and realize you’re in a good position. 



One last thing: It dosent matter that your friends might have slightly higher GPAs; I’ve seen people with 3.8 GPAs get into better places than people with GPAs close to 4.0. Research and connections are what matter most once you have a good GPA. Also, I would talk to as many professors, grad students, and former undergrads from Cornell about grad school before you apply. You may think you know what you’re doing when you go to apply, but they will likely give very important advice. I would esp. talk to grad students; Professors can have a skewed or out of touch view of the process.

There will always people who are better, richer, better looking or whatever than you. And you will be superior to others in all of these categories. Better to be your best and not worry about the others. Make yourself happy with whatever you are involved in. Others won’t matter

Tbh I used to compare myself with others a lot when I was in high school but I don’t do that anymore. I think the key (at least for me) is to realize that everyone has different tracks and everyone is unique. Some ppl have crazy gpas, others have amazing research experience/internships, but you certainly don’t have to be the same as them. Think about the poems or songs you write, think about the movies or books you love. You’re made up of things much more than grades, research and internships. Humans are not born to be compared, we’re born to feel and enjoy our own lives.



P.S. I’m not trying to discourage you from grinding hard and looking for opportunities. Just don’t let others, especially your interpretations of “others” disturb you that much.

Not sure about suggestions; just wanted to say that I often feel the same way when I compare myself with some of my friends

Grad student here! Just sent you a text, hope my opinion on this helps

If anyone is interested in one room or two rooms in a two bedroom apartment for a very affordable price, please contact me.

What's the "very affordable price"?



I comment this every time... just put the price in the listing. There's no good reason not to. Don't make people message you for it, which will waste their time if it's not within their budget.



Don't assume that what you think is "very affordable" is actually seen that way by everyone else. Give the number and let people decide for themselves. If it's actually a good deal, they'll contact you for more details.



\*\*\*And just as importantly, WHERE? $600 in Collegetown is a great deal. $600 in downtown Ithaca is probably an "okay" deal. Different parts of Ithaca have different rent ranges so location is a key part of what makes a price good or not.

shitty post

Do we have groupchats or...?

 

Also fellow transfers: contact me if you also don't wanna go random! Super chill & with a (relatively) healthy life style

Does anyone else automatically zone out when hearing text-to-voice?

Yeah it's lazy and annoying. I would rather hear someone speak passionately without the best sound quality than some fake robot voice. I find listening to these type of robot voices fall into the uncanny valley for me. I would rather just read text on the screen.

RISC-V is gaining momentum in recent times and many companies are pushing RISC-V based chips to the market.



https://youtu.be/GYXKMp4zdWM

Good. I hope they could recover and be a competitive against SiFive for example.

They mean that MIPS is currently manufacturing their first batch, and those chips should hit the market at the end of the year.  The article does make that clear.



GAP8 and GAP9 aren't made by MIPS.  They're made by GreenWaves.

Fair enough but the title says first RISC-V chips which is not true. GAP8\~9 are also RISC-V chips.

These are MIPS’s first RISC-V chips. The headline is accurate. If this were about the first fabrication of any RISC-V chip, then it wouldn’t put the company making them first—that information probably wouldn’t be in the headline. 



GAP8 and GAP9 aren’t made by MIPS. 



You seem to be doubling down on being obtuse, so I must assume you’re not making this statement in good faith.

What do they mean by the first chips? GAP8 and GAP9 have been available for a while now.

So their newest design is SMT capable?

Sorry, I’m not too knowledgeable about these things yet, could someone tell me what an risc-v chip is?

I was just giving an example of the type of questions he’d get asked as a junior transfer. No need to justify it to me lmao

Lol. Not justifying. That’s the scenario, so wondering if that makes sense. I personally told him it’s late in the game. But maybe not.



The number of houses that will bid unaffiliated juniors is limited, but considering the state of Cornell greek life he should get a bid somewhere. Being a transfer also helps, it’s a red flag if someone was at Cornell for 2 years already and didn’t rush.

Not super common but i had a junior in my PC, especially if a transfer I don’t think there’s anything weird/out of place with it. Feel like fraternities have a similar view, if they like you they like you

Really any social club will take anybody they feel they connect with and feel add somthing to their community. I'm sure some frats only want sophomores and freshmen, but I don't think that's ubiquitous across all groups. Definitly possible and definitly worth it, especially if he finds a group that resonates with him. It really is a good way to branch out and find a social circle... although rush is generally in the spring soooo, that's a small hurdle.

Not common but not unusual, especially for smaller houses. Def worth rushing and seeing what happens imo

It’s worth rushing in the fall, some houses will consider him if they like him as a person

if your friend plays a sport tell him to look at some of the club teams. i know the club baseball, soccer, hockey, lax, rugby teams are pretty tight knit. there are also a lot of cultural orgs he can look into. there is also the band and you don't need to have any prior experience to join. greek life is great but it isn't the only way to make friends

Yes, it's possible, and rush is always worth it in my opinion, at least for the IFC. A transfer hasn't had the chance to build up a friend network at Cornell, so Greek life is especially valuable in my opinion. 



I would strongly recommend that a junior transfer rush in the fall. A spring semester junior will only have one full year as a brother and may not be able to live in the house at all, and will be in a class of mostly freshmen, all of which may be detractors both for him and/or for the chapter he's interested in. Still, if for some reason he is unable to rush in the fall, it's still worth rushing in the spring. You have literally nothing to lose by going around and meeting people and being feted.



My chapter over the last several years has averaged a fall class of about 6–8, and there is usually at least one junior in the mix. We have not bidded a junior in our spring class in recent history, but that reflects the relatively small number of juniors rushing in the spring, not any kind of official or unofficial policy.

Westchester or Long Island





[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/v53k01)

you say traffic, i say vehicular block party. glass half full, not half empty.

The glass is always full

i'm fine with NYC i'm saying Long Island is annoying because you do need a car to get around, but to go anywhere other than Long Island you gotta go through the LIE which sucks. also i like skiing a lot and Long Island is flat.

lmao Long Island sucks man the traffic is awful and to get anywhere you gotta go through NYC.

Long Island has great beaches, all of NYC’s major airports, MLB, NHL, and NBA teams, significant diversity, landscapes that range from highly urban to picturesque rural, easy commutes to NYC, and some terrific public schools. It also has some quant, walkable towns, which stands out when compared to traditional American suburbia, chock full of strip malls and highways. 





Westchester is smaller, less diverse, more uniformly upscale (despite pockets that are not), slightly greener within commuting areas (beyond Yonkers, Mt. Vernon, and New Rochelle) but less quaint and more “typical America”-looking, an easier drive to more or less everywhere aside from Long Island, and more impressive in terms of nature towards its northern fringes. Excellent schools and commutes as well. 





I think they’re both too big to generalize.

Philadelphia is a longer trip but it has some nasty traffic

AEP 1100: lasers?

How difficult is it (labs, exams, problem sets, and content-wise)?

To add, the lab is split into two halves: demonstration and construction. Construction lab is a culture shock if you don’t have much prior experience with soldering/circuits, but the demonstration labs were mostly simple questions.

What all happens in the demonstration labs can you give a few examples? And do they teach you how to solder and stuff? Also do you need to take E&M before it or can it be taken concurrently?

Weekly studying boils down to the labs. Before going to the lab, you have to read the manual (about 1-2 hour a week) and for writing lab report, another 1-2 hours. So, 2-4 hours of weekly work. Don't worry about homeworks, they aren't even weekly and take less than an hour.

E&M is not necessary. Demonstration labs are mostly types of lasers, and there’s also one on fiber optics. They give a quick soldering demonstration, but nothing in-depth.

Content is ok, not too hard or easy, problem sets are pretty easy too (mostly plug and chug problems), exam questions are similar to PSet ones but with a couple extra steps. I found the labs to be pretty difficult tho.

Labs are long and hard but you learn a lot. Lab reports take 3-5 hours. I studied for the final exam for 1-2 hours and got a 93. Similar with the midterm. I found the hw has medium difficulty and takes 2 hours to do if you go to OH.

I have one barely used that you can have for free

you can get a new one at the ithaca walmart for like $25. 10/10 would recommend as a reliable form of transportation to block parties

caffeine addicts beware

Rent ~~is typically~~ can be >$2M/yr for retail space in Ctown

There’s no way in hell, I’m sorry. Apple pays a million a year or so for its GRAND CENTRAL Apple Store Location.

alright come thru rich international students. also where did you get that information? there's no way most of these spots are making $2m+ a year

The quote we got may have been high so we would fuck off. They probably want someone reputable for the long term lease (ie. fast food).

Where can you see these numbers?  That's kinda wild

aight time for some cornell students to make an affordable coffee shop in ctown gogogo

Probably an effort for corporate Starbucks to undermine public faith in unionization. Starbucks would have enough money to pay its property rent given that college students are caffeine addicts. So saying that it was not able to make enough money is not a reason to blame its shutdown.

Yup, they lost a lot of customers over the past couple years due to imposing draconian covid restrictions like mask mandates. I’m not surprised the store isn’t profitable enough to keep open anymore as a consequence.

There's a good chance it is because of this, which is beyond lame. The Starbucks is usually very busy with customers and it will be disappointing to have yet another empty storefront (and limited coffee options).

am awake and sober, so my understanding of what Starbucks told us is that they are closing the location due to it not being profitable enough and requiring a high amount of maintenance due to the grease trap in the back. This is questionable for a few reasons, and valid for a few others. The store has a cyclical profitability based off whether Cornell is in session or not, and during the summers it obviously tanks in terms of profitability. Makes sense to close the store then. But they’re closing it permanently, which was made explicitly clear, which is confusing because during the school year it’s Extremely profitable. 🤷‍♂️



The grease trap is also weird because they’ve been discussing doing the remodel this summer, and seemed to have plans for fixing up the store, especially after we struck a few months back over it, but then spontaneously went actually we’re closing the store forever goodbye.

It would seem to be so.



Another great look for empty Collegetown storefronts.

The other Starbucks aren’t closing so this one was probably just terrible. I’ve been to the others and they were both more crowded and better run. And of course the rent here is astronomical. There should be a high fine for empty storefronts that increases each year.

The other Starbucks are actually less busy, at least during the school year. During the summer the other locations become way more busy, the college Ave location is very dependent on the Cornell and Ithaca colleges. In terms of management, they other two locations definitely have more competent managers than ours (in terms of the last few months).

wow. people are losing their jobs and this is what you care about? get a life

Downtown is packed year round. The drive through also has lines and rent is much less. Collegetown has been empty every time I’ve gone. No IC people go there either. They go downtown.

People lose their jobs when businesses are bad. Maybe when you finish ILR you’ll understand it. There’s a labor shortage everywhere in Ithaca so it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a better job. Maybe they’ll even get an injunction against the closing.

I’ve worked at the downtown location and the collegetown location, the downtown location is busy all year, but during the school year the mobile orders at collegetown outweigh the normal day at downtown. The mobile orders make up probably 80% of orders at ct, which means that if you go in person you don’t see the vast majority of orders being placed and completed.

Maybe so, but that doesn't mean it's as profitable



Is it easier for Starbucks corporate to just shut down the store, rather than deal with unionized employees?

i believe nothing, it’ll probably just be an empty building

How did you know?

Pinkertons win again. ILR in shambles

Copper Horse Coffee in the law school

not exactly ctown but gimme in gates is somewhat close… not the best alternative though;;

Gimme in gates isn't too too far but I agree

Gimme at Gates is awesome, not sure it it's open during the summers though?

It will be open over the summer, same hours though so closed after 3pm and on weekends.

That actually sucks. CTB is a disgrace of an institution and there's not really anywhere else to get coffee in ctown besides 7/11.

Temple of zeus >>>>>>

OKnfelloe coffee enthusiasts who wants to start the next best collegetown coffee shop

Will you guys hand out discounts or free food or something?

How’s the corporate boot taste?

CTB has pretty meh coffee. Is there another store that you're referring to?

If only there were a non corporate, locally owned competitor literally right next door....

there is one in the commons, but it’s kinda far from campus so the ctown one was the best option. there are a number of different places to get coffee on campus though

there are a few Starbucks on campus itself, like the one in Olin library and in noyes, but they aren’t like actual Starbucks, they just serve a few Starbucks recipes in Starbucks cups but yk it’s coffee

incoming caffeine addicted freshman here. are there any other starbucks nearby or was the ctown one, the only one? thank you!!

lmao there hasn’t been a mask mandate in the store in like 4 months

Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

dude, the amount of people who cared about it the Covid mask policy was around  1-5%, the vast majority of customers not only were okay with it but agreed with it. There hasn’t been a mask mandate in the store in months and at least half of the customers will still wear masks when they come in. The reasoning for the store closing has nothing to do with customer retention.

No, it is much higher than 1-5%. You’re basing your conclusions on the customers who come into the store, but the customers who have been scared off aren’t coming into the store!

the customers who don’t come into the store aren’t customers and there was no significant dip in profits between pre Covid and post covid, the only dip was during covid

Feel free to provide their financial documents to prove that

that would be ~illegal~ for me to do, but they’ll probably be publicly released while the union bargains about the store closing. but as the guy who works at that store full time, people don’t get tight about masks anywhere near as much as you think they do

Well I’m not going to take any stock in the profit claim then until it’s shown. 



Those people used to be customers and are now gone. You don’t see them because the draconian policies have scared them away.



There’s no way in hell, I’m sorry. Apple pays a million a year or so for its GRAND CENTRAL Apple Store Location.

alright come thru rich international students. also where did you get that information? there's no way most of these spots are making $2m+ a year

The quote we got may have been high so we would fuck off. They probably want someone reputable for the long term lease (ie. fast food).

Where can you see these numbers?  That's kinda wild

Rent ~~is typically~~ can be >$2M/yr for retail space in Ctown

Yup, they lost a lot of customers over the past couple years due to imposing draconian covid restrictions like mask mandates. I’m not surprised the store isn’t profitable enough to keep open anymore as a consequence.

There's a good chance it is because of this, which is beyond lame. The Starbucks is usually very busy with customers and it will be disappointing to have yet another empty storefront (and limited coffee options).

Probably an effort for corporate Starbucks to undermine public faith in unionization. Starbucks would have enough money to pay its property rent given that college students are caffeine addicts. So saying that it was not able to make enough money is not a reason to blame its shutdown.

am awake and sober, so my understanding of what Starbucks told us is that they are closing the location due to it not being profitable enough and requiring a high amount of maintenance due to the grease trap in the back. This is questionable for a few reasons, and valid for a few others. The store has a cyclical profitability based off whether Cornell is in session or not, and during the summers it obviously tanks in terms of profitability. Makes sense to close the store then. But they’re closing it permanently, which was made explicitly clear, which is confusing because during the school year it’s Extremely profitable. 🤷‍♂️



The grease trap is also weird because they’ve been discussing doing the remodel this summer, and seemed to have plans for fixing up the store, especially after we struck a few months back over it, but then spontaneously went actually we’re closing the store forever goodbye.

It would seem to be so.



Another great look for empty Collegetown storefronts.

The other Starbucks are actually less busy, at least during the school year. During the summer the other locations become way more busy, the college Ave location is very dependent on the Cornell and Ithaca colleges. In terms of management, they other two locations definitely have more competent managers than ours (in terms of the last few months).

wow. people are losing their jobs and this is what you care about? get a life

Downtown is packed year round. The drive through also has lines and rent is much less. Collegetown has been empty every time I’ve gone. No IC people go there either. They go downtown.

People lose their jobs when businesses are bad. Maybe when you finish ILR you’ll understand it. There’s a labor shortage everywhere in Ithaca so it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a better job. Maybe they’ll even get an injunction against the closing.

I’ve worked at the downtown location and the collegetown location, the downtown location is busy all year, but during the school year the mobile orders at collegetown outweigh the normal day at downtown. The mobile orders make up probably 80% of orders at ct, which means that if you go in person you don’t see the vast majority of orders being placed and completed.

Maybe so, but that doesn't mean it's as profitable

The other Starbucks aren’t closing so this one was probably just terrible. I’ve been to the others and they were both more crowded and better run. And of course the rent here is astronomical. There should be a high fine for empty storefronts that increases each year.

i believe nothing, it’ll probably just be an empty building

Copper Horse Coffee in the law school

Gimme at Gates is awesome, not sure it it's open during the summers though?

It will be open over the summer, same hours though so closed after 3pm and on weekends.

not exactly ctown but gimme in gates is somewhat close… not the best alternative though;;

Gimme in gates isn't too too far but I agree

How’s the corporate boot taste?

CTB has pretty meh coffee. Is there another store that you're referring to?

there is one in the commons, but it’s kinda far from campus so the ctown one was the best option. there are a number of different places to get coffee on campus though

there are a few Starbucks on campus itself, like the one in Olin library and in noyes, but they aren’t like actual Starbucks, they just serve a few Starbucks recipes in Starbucks cups but yk it’s coffee

dude, the amount of people who cared about it the Covid mask policy was around  1-5%, the vast majority of customers not only were okay with it but agreed with it. There hasn’t been a mask mandate in the store in months and at least half of the customers will still wear masks when they come in. The reasoning for the store closing has nothing to do with customer retention.

No, it is much higher than 1-5%. You’re basing your conclusions on the customers who come into the store, but the customers who have been scared off aren’t coming into the store!

the customers who don’t come into the store aren’t customers and there was no significant dip in profits between pre Covid and post covid, the only dip was during covid

Hmm, not sure. I was able to log in using my normal email address. Sounds like a call to the CIT Helpdesk tomorrow.

Update- I reset my password and it worked! It turns out I had to wait until the two listervs were officially transferred to me in order to log in.

Woohoo!

From a Terrible Semester to a Better One! [UPDATE]

***"Mid-Semester" Review: Feedback and Tips*** 





*Here is the link to my previous post:* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/s3e9z0/terrible\_semester\_freshman/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/s3e9z0/terrible_semester_freshman/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 





***A quick note before I share my advice and tips:*** 



Grades do not define you, but school is school. You go to school to get grades. That is the reality of it. Yes, you are there to learn, but let us not pretend they are not significant. Last semester, while I did terribly on paper,  I learned so much. I love Cornell, yet the financial aspect has presented some challenges for me. So, having the best grades possible for scholarships and various opportunities is crucial for me. You may be rolling your eyes as I profess my love for Cornell, but when you risk having everything taken away from you, you begin valuing things once taken for granted. I have realized that school is a game, that you either play correctly or do not. Here are the tips and perspectives I employed in my daily life. Moreover, if you are on academic probation, here are some tips to consider for your next semester. Some tips may be self-explanatory or even basic, yet they were helpful as I began seeing improvements in my work. 



*"Front-Load Your Courses": do well at the beginning of the semester to set a precedent for your work.* The first two weeks of the semester are crucial. During this time, professors (and TAs) observe what kind of student you are and the type of work you contribute. Even if you are in bigger classes, attempt to establish that you are a driven and motivated student dedicated to the advancement of your learning. When teachers have a positive image of you, especially in more intimate classroom settings, you receive better grades for your work. Yes, this is rather idealistic, however, I have observed by communicating with professors, they continually offer guidance on how to better approach their assignments/exams. Furthermore, when you set a precedent for your work you seek to uphold your self-established standard. Lastly, anything can happen throughout the semester. Sometimes the syllabus changes due to various circumstances or family emergencies arise. Having a perfect grade at the midpoint of the semester (or before the last major exam or assignment) in most of your courses will give you a lot of leeway. \[Caution: "front-loading" should not serve as an excuse to procrastinate or submit less than superb work, but act as a safety net\] 



*Sit in the front of your classes and PARTICIPATE*: If you have the issue of skipping classes without guilt, here is a way to prevent that. I believe if you are paying for an education and frequently skipping classes, it's a waste of your or your parent's money. Skipping every once in a while is acceptable, but not advised in my humble opinion. When you participate and sit in the front, your presence is recognized. If you are on academic probation, you are there to prove to yourself that you can be successful. Even if you are not confident in the subject matter of the course, try and contribute your perspective. When the professor asks a question in class, attempt to answer it. I noticed that being an active student aiming to do well receives the attention of other high-achieving students. When you become "academic friends" with them, sometimes their company will hold you accountable. Also, you can learn a thing or two from them. 



*"Manifest Grades"*: *Envision the desired grade and outcome for every assignment, prelim, and exam.* This may be odd, but it makes perfect sense to me. With every upcoming assignment or prelim/exam, I would declare my desired grade and write how well I did on a whiteboard or mirror. For example, I would write "presentation for \[insert class name\] grade A, great public speaking abilities". I did this before starting the assignment or even studying for the exam. While this seems like an easy way to do things, it does not exempt you from doing the work. This helped me, as it mapped out the quality of work I needed to do and inspired me to believe excellent grades were achievable. As stated prior my goal was 3 A's and 1 B. 



*Figure out your learning method:* This is pretty rudimentary, but figure out what type of learner you are. Frankly, I am constantly figuring out what kind of learner I am. The course material/subject usually shapes how I study/do the work. For example, I am by no means a math person. To do math, I found I needed to conduct my notes in a very specific way. But essentially yourself questions like, "am I a visual learner? Do I learn better when I arrange my notes a certain way? Am I someone who can learn concepts fairly quickly? Are active recall and spaced repetition the best methods for me?



*The really simple stuff*: buy a planner, Microsoft One Note is very good for organizing your courses and study with others.





***June 2nd, 2022:*** 



So today is June 2nd, 2022. Looking back, there is still much to learn! While I employed all these tips and have received feedback from my teachers and grades for all my classes, next semester I seek to do my work further ahead of time and spent more time being an active learner during class time. Lol, I sound like a primary schooler, but I am very motivated to have a better cumulative GPA. Below I attached my grades from the fall to spring semester. 











Thank you for sharing these tips. I especially love that first one. ☺️ Great job and keep it up!

What a god

Nice work righting the ship! 👏

Amazing job!

Great work! I'm glad this hard work and documentation is helping you, and I think even though I'm a rising senior I definitely benefited from reading this as well. Have a great summer, and I hope you have a great fall semester!

Recs for summer life and events



I just finished my undergrad in Canada and don’t know anyone at Cornell (or much about the uni) so I’m eager to make some new friends and get involved! Or if anyone wants to chat I’d be happy to message :) If it helps with recommendations, I’m super into animals, neuroscience, sports, parties, LGBTQ+ events, etc. Appreciate it!

Enzo's basement jacuzzi is one of my most memorable experiences at Cornell. I will never forget what happened.

the BEST back rubs in town

As a matter of fact, you do not want to go near Enzo's jacuzzi

You don't want to miss out on summer nights in Enzo's jacuzzi

I would stay aware of Ithaca’s substantial block party scene

can u dm link

Could I also join the GroupMe?

Could i get an invite as well?

Fall Parking Spot (CTown)

is anyone subletting a parking spot in collegetown this fall or know where i can find one? thanks!

Cornelian in NYC here! Feel free to DM me if you want to talk. It can be lonely and overwhelming when you first move here, but I’m of the state of mind that everything always works out okay in the end.

You’re not alone and this is very normal and it will pass. When I first moved to my Ithaca apartment I had the exact same thing and it just took time. You will be ok. ❤️

Yeah dude I hate settling it’s very hard for me to be happy unless I’m already settled.



Cause they’re selfish jerks.



Could be martha who took em down, so new ones can be replaced

CS 2110 and ENGRD 2110

Yes, both are acceptable. You do not need to take it as the cross listed version just to get ENGRD credit.

As a recently accepted junior ECE transfer to Cornell, I was wondering if any previous junior transfers could share their social life experience in Cornell. Having half of the college covered already, were you able to have a lively social life on campus? I am worries since often in college by junior year people tend to have solidified friends groups which are hesitant to expand further. I assume dorming in a quad/triple/double could help greatly as an initial boost to meet people.

It was really hard for me unfortunately :( I had a really lonely year. But I was unlucky and was not placed near or with other transfers. And I’m also an introvert with social anxiety, so that probably didn’t help either lol

Do you know if Cornell itself takes care of placing all transfer close to each other? Thank you tho, that was a relief

I, as a transfer, was placed in a suite with 3 other transfers and another dude who was a transfer. Some of my friends were on floors where the entire floor was transfers. But I also had friends who got placed alone on North. So I'd say Cornell ideally places transfers close to each other most of the time but because of limited housing it doesn't happen all the time.

Thank you!!

Most transfers are dorming on the same floor or suite or whatever so a lot of friends u make are transfers. From there it’s pretty much what u make of it.

Don’t worry! I’m not a transfer but I have a bunch of friends who are junior transfers. It’s easy for transfers to know each other as well based on what I’ve heard.

Thank you!!

I transferred in fall 2021 as Junior in CAS and so far my experience has been phenomenal! Cornell is really welcoming when it comes to transfers; the friend group I made during Orientation week has stuck together till now even though we are in completely different schools and majors. So definitely take advantage of events during o-week to get to know other people. I also going thru core classes for my major I met a lot of great peeps as well. Wishing you the best, ik it'll turn out great!

To the chime master playing scarborough fair just now:

Thank you. I love the song. We have the same taste. Could you please play love story from the movie love story for me as well?

damn I checked the chime concert schedule before it got updated again today. Didn't expect them to have so many concerts

Rate my Professor

Make sure y’all get on there are rate your professors to help your fellow Cornellians out. Also a question… can professors get on there and request that their ratings be removed? Before I took a terrible class this semester I thought I remembered seeing terrible ratings for the prof, but when it was actually time to sign up for classes, they were gone. I thought I must just be remembering wrong, but I feel like this prof should have ratings. She’s been at Cornell for a while, it was a big enough class, and she was absolutely terrible.

I agree, it is helpful to other students to post honest reviews.

Yes, I think ratings can be removed. I rate most of my profs very highly (from a previous school) I had one genuinely incompetent professor who should not have been teaching and wrote an honest review of them (no inflammatory wording or personal attacks, which can get a post removed) and the posting disappeared.The same prof had a few reviews of stuff like "love them! gives out candy during exams!" Which was totally weird since they didn't have exams in any of their classes. Over time I saw a few reviews for other professors with the same comment about profs being "saints who gave out candy during exams" as well as some glowing reviews of some well known terrible profs, so my guess was some newer profs (as this one was) were hiring people to post good reviews. It was a while ago when Rate was newer and more people used it.That said, I have seen negative posts, so perhaps people can request a certain number to be removed?

>help your fellow Cornellians out.

Anyone wants a lift from Newark to Ithaca?

Ravenwood apartments

I have a couple friends who live there and their place is pretty nice. No glaring issues as far as I know





Depending on which unit you get, the laundry room might be kinda far or annoying to get to, especially when it snows. When it snows, they do a pretty good job of plowing the stairs and pathways. 



The 4 bedroom units have two floors which is really nice. There's a lot of living room space. The 3 bedroom units may feel kinda cramped, depending on what you're used to

I’ve had friends live there and it was nice, clean, and quiet. Definitely a good place. And it’s at the bottom of west below the slope so you’ll have a walking hobby

Looking for comp bio / bioinformatics advice

Hi everyone! I'm a rising junior in the bio major with a concentration in computational biology. I'm generally interested in going to grad school for comp bio/bioinformatics, but I'm having trouble with course selection and my advisor also seems unsure of which courses I should take. I was wondering if I could talk to an undergrad or grad student who's familiar with the comp bio course offerings and which ones would best prepare me for grad school. Thanks!!

Honestly just take what interests you - most grad programs aren’t even going to look at your course history
