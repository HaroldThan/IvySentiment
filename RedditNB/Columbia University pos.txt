Not sure what visa you are on, but I'd look into whether you are allowed to work at all. That's not always the case and might be better not risking it.

email the registrar, typically they’re kind of terrible about actually charging the right amount.

Any premeds willing to answer questions/give some advice?

Sorry for all of the questions in advance!!







3. Did you find any of the following Core classes objectively time-consuming/stressful, or is it all perspective: LitHum, CC, ArtHum, or MusicHum?





5. Would anyone be willing to take a look at my four year plan and quickly critique it? I’ve made two lmao. 









** I have experience in Physics and Bio. Took honors and AP versions of both. Did well in all 4. Had a teacher who did a great job—I think—establishing the foundation of Physics. I also feel like Bio is the least difficult of the prereqs, but ik Columbia likes to be difficult and different. I figured blending those sets of classes together would be a nice mixture of familiarity and newness so not as stressful. 





Has anyone here done this before? Any tips or thoughts? I’d like to be a freelancer rather than be hired by a company.

I used to tutor through tutor doctor. It doesn't pay as much as finding your own students/clients, but the resources they had were incredible. I would get free SAT/ACT books as well as some other study manuals. And they always had a steady stream of students.

Original person I was subleasing from had something come up and had to back out. 



[Looking For] Summer 3 month lease within 15-20 minute Commute to Midtown Manhattan





2. Maximum budget: **$1400/month** inclusive of all fees and utilities. Would prefer to stay under.

5. Furnished units are heavily preferred.

Is it realistic for GS student to expect to spend around



$13,000 for dorm(private bedroom but shared bathroom and kitchen at teacher's college dorm)



$6,600 for meal plans for Spring and Fall



$2,000 for Summer food





$5,000 for books and miscellaneous costs(phone plan etc)



This all add up to around $98,600 per year. Is there anything more I should expect to pay?



Sounds about right.



Thank you for your reply! Btw are the dorms open during the winter?

Everything is relative to who you are, and what you want to do. Many never need formalwear. You can get a great winter coat at TJ Maxx for about $100. Style is an affectation.



I believe you have the option of renting them throughout the whole year, but you have to be a full time student. I'd contact the admissions office for gs. they're actually surprisingly helpful. :)

Not sure, I hope someone else can answer. CU has notoriously arcane housing policies.

Tj Maxx is the shit. Their winter coats are pretty legit. I found a (columbia brand) down coat out of season for $60. I've literally seen it for like $299 at dicks.

$5k per year is very low if you expect to have any social life, attend galas or balls, occasional off campus events with student life. You also need formal wear— and you need it multiple times a year, ranging from black tie to regular business clothing. Clothing budget is actually surprisingly large beyond formal wear, since NYC has the craziest weather ranging from -5 in the winter to 120 deg F in the summer. 



You should factor all of that in.

Actually, 5k for books seems like way to much to me. (OH didn't misc is included.) Regardless, books cost me around 1k this year. If you're premed or on a STEM path. Keep in mind that many books are used multiple times, so buying sometimes makes more sense. For example, Zumdahl will be used for gen chem 1 and 2. Can't remember the calculus book, but it I believe it's used in calc 1-3. People also sometimes "share" books. Talk to your classmates about it.

Housing will cost more than that. Significantly more than that. Unless you're going home between semesters. Other than that, yeah, that's about right.

Thank you!



Thank you for your detailed response.

As an expert on admissions to computational maths/financial engineering postgraduate programs, I am going to say that the fact that you had a lot of fun majoring in maths and stats makes you a mutant. But one who will likely have a very competitive application. 



Just make sure you are a pleasant person to work with and have good relationships with your professors. Letters of recommendation go a long way. 



I think how much is gained depend on what you're doing. If you want a PhD in stats or something else very quantitative the math major will help. But if you're not doing that I think math-stats will basically give you the same outcomes.

Thank you for your detailed response.

i’m getting my master’s from columbia vp&s through a 2-year program and considering bard hall / 50 haven ave for safety and to get to know more people, but it’s pricier than off-campus and i’ve heard some people calling the building cheap and kind of gross. anyone have any thoughts on bard or recommend some safe areas in washington heights to check out for off-campus apartments?



commitment to on-campus housing is due in a few days, not sure where to go from here

Bringing a Desktop PC? + Tech Recommendations

Hi, guys, I'm an incoming freshman, and I was wondering weather or not the dorm rooms have enough space for a desktop pc and monitor. Is it easier to just stick with a laptop? Is having a tablet worth it? Also does anyone have any laptop/tech recommendations.

For someone going into SEAS would you recommend Mac or Windows? Are there software that are used that only support Windows?

There is room but it’s not worth it unless you are a hardcore gamer, laptops are way more convenient especially since you’ll want to go to the libraries and stuff. 



I got an iPad Air junior year and it’s a game changer. Taking notes on that beats physical notebooks by a mile. Get Goodnotes or Notability and the Apple Pencil. 



MacBooks have superior battery life and the cross connections with iPads/phones is really useful so if you can go for that it seems best. I work in finance though so I have a Windows laptop which is fine too. This depends on your price range, no need to get super fancy.

A laptop is best, you want to be able to take notes and augment the slides from lectures etc.

Getting a laptop means you can carry it around with you to classes or the library, so that's probably the better option. You can still bring a monitor for the dorm, but that's a matter of personal preference -- know that the convenience of having a monitor right there might bind you to your room (esp. if you already spend a lot of time on your PC at home), which may or may not be what you want. As someone who just finished freshman year, I personally loved going to the library to do work at night because I could bring a friend or still see people I knew if I went alone, which definitely helped me strengthen friendships.

I had a gaming laptop which basically acted like a desktop and extra monitor, as well as a small cheap 6yr old secondary device to pull up textbooks on, and it worked pretty well, but I kinda wished I had a more practical daily computer that I could actually take to libraries and stuff. If you're a gamer and already have a pc it's worth it to bring your own (if you're in a single), but if you're thinking about buying something, get a versatile laptop that can do everything cause it'll be a better purchase in the long run

I did the same thing and I don't regret it. I woulda failed here if I had my gaming pc lol. Oh well. Won't see a video game until I finish medical school. I'll be back with my dudes in 15 years.

Don’t bring a gaming PC with you to Columbia. I had a sweet rig, but I knew if I brought it, the temptation/distraction would hurt my GPA and I would also miss out on social opportunities. I was absolutely right. I used to be a huge gamer, but I literally didn’t miss it.

There's space. It'll be a hassle though depending on how you travel. Really only need a desktop if you plan on gaming and a monitor if you're doing design. Otherwise laptop and even tablets are fine.

Most of my fellow premed classmates haven't used paper of any kind besides books since we started school here. It's certainly not essential to have an ipad, but an iPad air will make you save so much time. That being said, if you're not STEM, you probably won't use it as much. Gen chem 1, 2, and orgo are painful without a tablet. If you're an arts major, stick with a nice laptop. If you're a STEM major, get an ipad if possible.

For someone going into SEAS would you recommend Mac or Windows? Are there software that are used that only support Windows?

Culpa review got me really interested in the course, but it seems that it's one of the most difficult in compsci department.



Thanks! Is it possible to do well in it without knowing ai though?

Yes, it is.





The Artificial Intelligence course could be a good precursor course to give insight into how ML may be. But ML is definitely more in depth wrt math.

Oh thanks! I have a concern that the prof is not so approachable. Is it true??

I agree that the class is very difficult and in my opinion excessively so. However I found Verma to be very approachable in office hours and a great person overall.

Very true. He just has a very blunt style where it's basically his way or the highway. Only take the class if you have 20 hours a week to spend on this to do medium well. In the spring course, something like an 18% was a B- on the midterm and a 28% was a B- on the final. Yes there is a curve but you can imagine just how hard the actual class is - if you want to have a social life and do anything else but stress out about this class, pick something else. Very statistics and math heavy, very little computer science.

Thanks. I think that's what it matters, but some review seems to indicate that he's not so approachable

Yes, I meant to add percentages, fixed.

Ohh do you mean 18 people out of 100 get lower than B-?? Or, 18 points out of 100?

18%. As in 18/100 points 😂

No need to take AI. Expect the class to be hard though

Yes, it is.

Im looking for things to write about in my supps. Something I cant find by just browsing the internet.

Don’t rely on others to find you supp content, advisors can see through that like glass. 



Not to be a grouch and useless, here are some ideas that may give you some direction. Think about what would actually make you want to come here. Do you like the bubble in Manhattan idea? Or do you want something more integrated in the city? Is there a particular club you like in HS that Columbia has? If so, try going to one of the meetings (I doubt any club would really mind, unless you act weird about it). Into film photography? Try checking out the darkroom. ie figure out what’s important to you (besides it being Columbia) and go see that.

This world has become so boring. Peace and respect to your app process though, OP.

You should write about how much research you want to do, that's what Columbia seems to be most oriented toward in my experience. I think being specific would be best here too (type of research, specific labs, specific professors)

The second paragraph is what I was looking for. Thank you.



Thank you..?

Ill be writing about research some how regardless as it is one of my ECs, but I want to reference specific things like, say, what aspect of a building or a lab I liked. Something that shows attention to detail

It’s not about the individual things to see, touring a campus is about getting the feel for a place. There are all types of colleges, Columbia is rare in that it is an urban school but still very much has a bubble in which it exists. Other urban campuses feel much more integrated into the city. Like you can look at some of the other College buildings in Manhattan and you wouldn’t know they’re a school except for the signage.

Thank you

Be on the lookout for which library is best for you to study/relax and conveniently located near the buildings your classes located at etc.

Alright thanks!

[Postcrypt Coffeehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcrypt_Coffeehouse), the student-run music venue/art gallery hidden in the basement of St. Paul's Chapel. 



Although, if you are visiting in the summer, you may find it difficult to visit Postcrypt or see much outside the standard tour. Student life is active mostly during the fall/spring season. Summer campus is mostly alumni reunion week, undergrads doing lab research, or pre-college immersion program kids.

Not the worst recommendation

Are you sure you're not conflating that with the [cyclotron](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/nyregion/20atom.html#:~:text=The%20machine%2C%20known%20as%20a,subatomic%20particles%20and%20split%20atoms.) in the basement of Pupin, used to split the atom intentionally for the second time in human history just days after Denmark, much of which was removed a little over a decade ago?

Isn't it just a tokamak? And I'm pretty sure it's not "old" and very much in use.

How do you go down below level 1?

Yeah I’m sure.

I could be wrong on the details, I just know I’ve gone down and seen it and it’s pretty cool adventuring down.

You take the stairs, it’s not really hidden, it’s just tucked away somewhere accessible. No one cares if you go see it

Definitely cool. No one will question it if you just sneak in.

General Atomics TRIGA Mark-II fission reactor. CU was going to have a nuclear engineering department, featuring an operating fission reactor in Manhattan, but the student protests in the 60s-70s put an end to it. Students entered what are now the APAM offices and poured radioactive dust over everything.



What you see through the APAM office windows is not exactly the fission reactor. That is a now dead experiment, Collisionless Terella experiment (CTX). CTX was built on top of the TRIGA.

Cool! Thanks for the info!

If you go into the depths of Mudd, there's an old nuclear reactor. Just gotta venture through some places that seem like you shouldn't be there.

I like the terrace outside the law school.

I just toured campus the other day. Did the self-guided audio tour found [here](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/visit/campus)—highly recommend.

is columbia near lots of things to do as a young post-grad?

i'm a recent grad from a big and very walkable city that's currently planning on moving to morningside heights soon (planning on grad school). ive been to ny many many times but never actually lived there and the people i know who have lived there went to nyu/lived downtown. do columbia students generally stick to the morningside heights  area or do people take the up to 45 minute train ride to downtown to do things regularly? i went to undergrad in an area with good public transit and that long of a ride would generally not be reasonableto do regularly. i have no specific attachment to downtown at all, it's just more of what i know, so im just curious if how far uptown columbia is isolates the student body from parts of the city that have lots to do for young people. please tell me if i'm totally off base, i don't have any sources to ask for this type of info so i undersrand i may be totally off. thanks for any advice!

It’s not a terrible place to be post-grad, since the rents are cheaper and overall Morningside Heights is a nice place to live. There are a few bars and great restaurants in the area, but most young people will take the train downtown for more of the action. 45 minutes to get downtown is a bit overblown: you can easily get to Times Square/Midtown in 20, NYU area in 30ish. That’s a very reasonable train commute for “fun” for most young post-grads. I’d definitely characterize it for post-grads who want to be a little separated from the action and live somewhere quieter (and possibly cheaper) compared to living somewhere like East Village.

okay thanks for the info, i had a feeling that was the situation but i was looking at the distance to a favorite spot of mine close to the manhattan bridge and it was 45 minutes and started to make me unsure of my decision. glad to hear i was misunderstood

Well, cross town could take a bit longer by train btw bc you’d have to change trains or hop on a bus or something.



The trains in Manhattan mostly run North/South but there are major junctions like 59th st and 42nd where you can switch.



I’d be surprised if you didn’t find new “favorite spots” though.





On the train you can get to midtown within 15-20 min, downtown maybe 10 min after that. And that’s on the *1* train, which hits every stop. Express trains such as the *A* could get you downtown in 15 minutes potentially.



Columbia students explore the city. You’re in Manhattan ffs.

The subway gets you all over Manhattan faster than any of car commutes I've ever had.

Studio Housing Guest Policy

Hi All! I need to make a decision by 12 am tonight about choosing a studio off-campus at Columbia. I need to know if there is any guest policy for residents living in studios before I can put a deposit down. If anyone has this information it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

If you’re a grad student guests are not monitored.

Looking for Tenant for studio right across Morningside park

Hi, i am currently looking for a new tenant to take over my lease. Its really spacious studio that you have to share bathroom(has separated shower booth and toilet) with other male. Furnished with desk, bed and closet as well as fridge and a small kitchen. Its located right across morningside park on Manhattan Ave for only $1325. If anyone is interested please hit me a message. Thanks!

Are there some classes in Columbia that are taught by graduate students and undergraduates?

Fuck that so hard



ArtHum, likely MusicHum as well.

A lot of core classes are taught by grad students completely. Not so much CS, Math, and sciences. But in those classes, most of the grading will be grad students.

I've had some classes in which TA graded everything but lectures were done by professors.

How about CS,stat and math?

Probably there are some in CS for upper level classes (I'm not sure)



No, some of the calc classes are taught by phd students. And I would be shocked if the *upper* level courses in any department were taught by anything but professors. It's extremely rare if it happens at all. If there are grad students teaching, it's almost certainly in the more introductory classes. To answer the OP's question, you might have graduate instructors in core classes, beginner and intermediate language classes, calc classes, and maybe labs for intro science classes (if you need to take them). I haven't heard of phd students being the primary lecturers in stat or CS classes (discussion sections at most).

Yes some courses in humanity are taught by grad students



Edit: There are also likely recitation and discussion sections for many of the CS and math classes held by TAs where they teach/review content for the main class, so I guess that also might count.

There are some taught by PhD students but in my experience they have all been fantastic, and often better than profs because they were more approachable and personable since they weren’t a famous tenured big dick Professor (in my experience at least). I’ve also had TAs who were complete clowns so I guess the experience varies a lot

ESP. Taught entirely by undergrads. Technically speaking not a class. It's Pass Fail only but it does show on your transcript as one credit.

I had several courses, including stem courses, taught by Grad students. To name a few: 

Many of these professors were close to finishing their dissertation though.

Fuck that so hard



ArtHum, likely MusicHum as well.

Probably there are some in CS for upper level classes (I'm not sure)



No, some of the calc classes are taught by phd students. And I would be shocked if the *upper* level courses in any department were taught by anything but professors. It's extremely rare if it happens at all. If there are grad students teaching, it's almost certainly in the more introductory classes. To answer the OP's question, you might have graduate instructors in core classes, beginner and intermediate language classes, calc classes, and maybe labs for intro science classes (if you need to take them). I haven't heard of phd students being the primary lecturers in stat or CS classes (discussion sections at most).

How about CS,stat and math?

This will be hard to get an answer to since none of us have access to financial aid info outside of the same internet resources you have access to. So, I'll just tell you what happened to me with financial aid and loans.



I started with an 18k a year scholarship and got a 6k boost (24k) for year 2 and then a 5k boost (29k) for year 3, my last. They also gave out some covid bucks (about 3k a year for my last 2 years, I think) but I'm not sure if they will keep doing that. I also got a full pell grant each year (about 5k each year, I believe). I worked a job to pay my non-tuition expenses and took out loans to cover the rest of my tuition (roughly). I also had some savings that I dipped into and I worked an internship that paid relatively well for one summer.





\--edit--



The amount of boosts in scholarship happened because I kept a high GPA (>3.9)

GS has very little aid and students foot most of the bill.  Expect maybe 15k a year in scholarship, it's merit-based, not need-based.  GS aid is improving, but most students either come from wealthy families or use veteran benefits.

Very much depends on your situation. If you have a spouse paying for the majority of your rent and living expenses, it's not too bad. If you have to pay for your living expenses and your planning on going full time, it's going to be a lot

Varies depending on your situation and grade. I am starting with total aid of 22,000 USD per year as an international student. The largest amount  of aid offered from comparable schools like Northwestern/Brown.

also interesting, at an average total cost of 83k, and average award of 61k, the average net cost is 22k out of pocket:

Thank you for any advise.

That’s amazing! When time of day do the housing units typically get updated? Congrats on getting into Columbia! 🥳

All throughout business hours, I think! So I checked often from 8am-5pm from Monday through Thursday. Congrats to you too!

Oh wow thats awesome! I assume there must be more spots available by Thursday afternoon since the housing office is probably getting prepared for another group of students bidding on Friday. I'm super grateful for this post because I was worried that waiting until Monday morning would be too risky lol

Hold out hope. The same thing happened to me a few weeks ago when my housing appointment opened up on a Friday—there were only $2500 studios left. Check back throughout the next week because the housing office adds more units everyday. I started off with only 13 available units when my appointment started and 55 units when my appointment ended the following Thursday.

All throughout business hours, I think! So I checked often from 8am-5pm from Monday through Thursday. Congrats to you too!

Has anyone been able to schedule Zoom medical appointments with Columbia online?

I was able to see a practitioner for my problem since it's sort of an emergency. 



Thanks those sound great!

in my experience, the practitioners won't let you schedule an appointment until you have the referral 



yes, thanks!

You should be able to send a message through the portal.

Students discounts

Ohh! That’s really useful! Thanks!!

Sign up for WSJ , FT, and NYT subscriptions. WSJ is a small price, but it's niiiiiiice. I also use my .edu to get cheap Spotify and Bloomberg subscriptions. The Spotify subscription comes with Hulu (w commercials).

Foodtown also does this!

Wow! That’s super useful!

There’s a grocery shop on the upper west side that gives 10% discount to Columbia students. Called Garden of Eden

Oh really? That’s a nice way to pass time 😅

would add that a NYPL card gives you access to a bunch of museums including guggenheim (which we don't get thru columbia). super easy to get a card, just go to any library with a proof of address. I just showed them an email from columbia housing that had my wein mailing address.

That’s really neat!

I believe you can get into a lot of museums for free/discount

Yeah I do know about those, but I figured there might be some other discounts offered on behalf of Columbia… a couple of friends at Northeastern mentioned that some unis have separate portals to offer discounts lol

apple, and others  give student rates - best buy, adorama,BH...Hulu, amazon prime student rate etc...

Oh, okay!

You can use your email address to get lots of discounts. I use unidays, but there are other websites that are similar

Ctown 125 st

There are general student discounts on touristy areas, especially free museums and performing arts events. Techwise, pretty much everywhere. Locally, a few shops and restaurants offer.

Ohh! That’s really useful! Thanks!!

Dean's List Announcement

Have Dean's List honours been announced for the Spring 2022 semester (for SEAS)? Not sure if they are being held up by some courses which haven't published all grades yet - saw some bad things about Fundies grades. Also, is the threshold still 3.6, or is it increased?

Ah got it, thanks!

Ah got it, thanks!

Student Contribution

Ok so the 2,400 student contribution that every student has…I’m pretty sure everyone? Is it an actual bill that we have to pay or just an estimation of out of pocket expenses a student will pay throughout their year. I’ve heard both cases and would love to know which one it is! 

Thanks!



But that $ doesn’t have to explicitly come from your bank account. It could be from your parents, outside scholarships, whatever. But that money goes to Columbia explicitly



Ahh I see. Any ideas on why Columbia still hasn’t waived this fee yet? Other peer institutions (stanford, duke, penn, etc.) have removed their mandatory fee to make it more accessible to student that are highly-aided



At the schools you mentioned, I think they just force highly-aided students to do work-study to make up for this amt. I do appreciate that Columbia at least gives us the opportunity to pay it directly instead of having to commit a lot of time to work-study (esp in ur freshman year when you're still learning how to navigate)

Not everyone, but most have 2400 contribution. However some, including me, got into specific scholars programs (about 10 SEAS and 10 CC students per year) and have an increased scholarship which doesn't include any student contribution or on-campus job.

Can GS student use teacher's college dorms?

Or are GS students only allowed to use GS housing?

I’m pretty sure GS students can only live in New Res. Except for GS students in New Res, TC housing (run by TC ORS) is separate from CU housing (run by CU UAH).

GS students use grad housing. Teachers college dorms are grad housing so GS can use TC dorms. The most popular TC choice for GS students is New Res.

Vacation

Weird question hahah but by any chance, would anyone be interested in going to Portugal with me during Winter break lol. Flights to Libson are really cheap right now ($391 Delta) roundtrip from NYC to Libson. The airbnbs are really cheap, 31 dollars a night, and I would be wanting to share it. The dates would be after Christmas (1/9-1/16). I would love to have something to look forward to after Fall semester ends!



Let me know

Sure thing buddy! Especially if you are paying. Seriously though a group trip to Europe would be fantastic.

Sounds fun!

Apparently people do lol.



https://www.hostelworld.com/blog/travelling-with-strangers/

I went to Portugal for winter break a few years ago (pre-covid!) Absolutely wonderful. I can't go with you this time, but I definitely recommend going to the beaches in the south as well as Sintra (right outside of Lisbon.) Also, if you drink alcohol try the green wine for sure and they have pastries there that are really good. Obvs the Port wine is what they're known for, but green wine is SO good. Lisbon is one of the least expensive cities I've visited in Europe and it was sunny and not too cold in January (definitely not too touristy, which was so nice compared to the packed streets of Paris and Rome.) Also, the language barrier was barely present--DO NOT attempt to speak Spanish in place of Portuguese. They HATE that. Spain is their long-time rival. Speak English instead if you can't communicate in Portuguese. Most people interacted with in Lisbon spoke English pretty well.

Not to question your plans to find a travel buddy, but you could also travel by yourself. I've done that a bunch and I meet people more easily that way--usually in bars or clubs.



Have fun!!

That’s all. I honestly just wanted to share. Have a great day all🤭

Yep. Says so on their official website

you can actually still access it not on campus, but some of the channels might be restricted since youre "not connected to campus wifi." (source: i use it all the time at home)

you can sign into spectrum TV with your uni

Huh. Didn’t know

But how

Free serviceeee

Is it the free trial or is it a free service? How do you sign up?

Yep, I used it to watch the Winter Olympics! Got to see some nice curling action.

very… I feel so bad for Zverev

Nadal vs Zverev was crazy 😩

leads for off campus housing?

Desperately looking for a 1bd or studio around Morningside but it seems like there's nothing?? Anyone have recommendations for where to look (tried fb groups and rent hop/streethopper)? My budget is 2200 so idk if that's too low for morningside? I didn't think it was that pricey..

But but but, black and brown people live there! /s

i'd recommend looking farther up north, especially if your priority is not having a roommate. i'm paying $2,100/month for a huge 1 bedroom in washington heights right off the 1 subway



I heard the 30 Morningside building is even more insane. A friend of mine got a studio (a big studio tho) for freaking $5600. Average American struggles to earn half of this rent. Back in Ohio I can rent a town house with yards and garage for only 1500. NYC really blew me away when I first came to Columbia

A fool and his money are soon parted

I honestly dont think any sub 2200 option exists after COVID. My rent is 4500 for a 1b. My landlord made an absurd rent raise this year and I had been trying to find a new apartment for two months. Anywhere near Columbia, all vacant spots are gone instantly right at moment they become available. So I ended up renewing my current lease  and paying the absurd rent. 



To go for 2000-ish rent near Columbia you must find yourself a roommate. Also brokers can help a lot as they can secure a vacant room before it’s open to the public (but only trust someone you personally know, because a bad broke can easily cost you hundreds of dollars).

That’s going to be tough to find right now, in your budget you should probably be looking to the north of the neighborhood or to the east of morningside park, or searching for roommates. Personally I pay 2900 for a 1 bedroom (which I split with a roommate, so my share is 1,450).

Look around 103rd and West End.  It's a 10-15 min walk to campus and there's a subway stop right there.  Quiet area and in your budget.

Try looking on StreetEasy, you should be able to find what you’re looking for in the Upper West Side across 80-110 St

You will need a roommate. Expect to pay $1500 a piece for a 1br where 1 person shares a living room. That's morningside heights post covid. If you asked last year, landlords woulda been begging you at that price.

Hey all! I am a rising senior from Philly coming to NYC this summer for my internship. I’ll be living around W 107th st and my work will be in midtown. 



Any advice y’all may have for living in Upper West Side, commute, making friends, etc? I wanna make sure I experience NYC to the fullest!

try to do something new every day. It could be walking down 57th instead of 56th for the one block, trying a new restaurant, or taking the A instead of the 1 to get somewhere. Eventually, you’ll fall into a routine but keep pushing to do something new daily. 



Also, if you’re on ig, follow secret_nyc, it’s a bunch of bar ads but they promote cool venues and pop-ups. Also follow some venues for concerts if that’s your jam (Terminal 5 is close in Midtown West; Irving Plaza, Rockwood, all get good smaller artists; Brooklyn isn’t a terrible commute for events).

hi! if we graduate in summer, do we still walk in the spring of that year, or would we be walking the following spring? thank you!

You can request to walk the spring before--but you have to request it. If you're in CC or SEAS, ask your advisor.

Is the area near St Nicholas Park Safe?

I’ve found an apartment that I really like around St Nicholas Terrace and 127th, but I’m worried about the area’s safety, particularly at night. Does anyone know about this area of West Harlem, in particular on the South end of St Nicholas Park? Thanks!

Thank you! This is good to know and very helpful

One of my classmates was a born and raised New Yorker. He recommended staying south of campus. Of course it depends on your build, street smarts, and times that you'll be out. If you use the Citizen app, you'll see that a lot of stuff goes down around there.

This map is pretty handy for figuring out crime in different areas of NYC. I find the crime location map and heat map more useful than the precinct map. https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/

Thank you! This is good to know and very helpful

Has anyone take HRTS 3001 Andrew Nathan Intro course?



Does anyone have feedback on these courses?

intro to human rights is an easy class but nathan’s lectures weren’t very engaging and i don’t feel like i learned that much. the TAs were more interesting to talk to, and i learned more from the readings

Manijeh Moradian

She’s fantastic! Take that.

it is an easy A but not very engaging

She’s fantastic! Take that.

I don't think I've heard anything for a really long time? My friend in the other section said they got grades a week or so ago but I'm not sure if that's possible 



Anyone got updates?

Research Opportunities?

Hi,







If anyone has any ideas on how to go about finding such opportunities, that'd be super appreciated!



Research for a professor is a business built on publications. Like any other business, they’re going to need new hires to be familiar with their line of work and not completely green. Best of luck!

I'm speaking about the Econ department. The first time is a bit hard, then it becomes easier as you work with more people. For the first time, you've two conventional options:





When you send an email, try to briefly show your familiarity and interest in the topic––I do not recommend sending the same email to everyone.



Best of luck!

Literally just email a bunch of professors and ask if they're taking students and say you're interested in working with them. Cold emailing is very underrated. It will yield results. Not everyone will respond, but if you email like 10 people, someone will probably respond.

It you’re in Econ the best way is to take a class with a prof you want to do research for an show that you’re 1) smart 2) actually interested in their stuff / Econ broadly. You should also have coding skills assuming you want to do empirical stuff.



Hi! I was wondering if any of you would recommend running routes near Columbia University? I am not super familiar with the neighborhood, and so I am looking for routes that are safe for early morning runs. Would the northern part of Central Park/Morningside Park/ Riverside Park (\~110th St.) be good and safe choices? Thanks!

Riverside Park is pretty good. Especially with the greenery and the river view.   





I have been going there for early morning runs for a while now. As for safety, it feels pretty safe based on my experience.

Central Park is safe and probably the most interesting place to go. You have some wooded paths, the main loop, and paths around the reservoir and Harlem Meer. If it's actually dark out, stay out of the woods (mostly because it's extremely dark once you get off the path). There will be runners there even after dark or before dawn in the summer. Riverside Park is also safe, but is flat and kind of boring. You can't really do much beyond a simple out and back straight along the river. It's nice enough to do once or twice per week, but it gets old very quick. Both places will have lots of runners/bikers/dog walkers early in the morning. Morningside park doesn't really have anywhere to run and it's close enough to northwest Central Park that there's no reason to pick it. It's technically safe once the sun comes out, but it's basically on the side of cliff. It's not really a place to run.

Riverside Park is the best, I really love it.  Tons of runners.  I've spent a lot of time there and have never felt unsafe.



Northern Central Park is okay.  Morningside Park is terrible for anything other than running stairs.  You don't want to be in either after dark.

Like many others said, Riverside is better and safer in my experience than both the north part of Central Park, and Morningside. Avoid Morningside unless it’s the middle of a well-lot day and I would stay off of the upper trails because much of it is out of view. Lots of violence and crime happens there.



I would also recommend only running south in Riverside unless it is the middle of the day, the sections to the north of 125th get a little sketchy.

100% Riverside park should be your go to. Safe and you can run as much as you like. Central Park is also nice but a Lil far from Columbia.

Riverside Park is good. Central Park if I have more time on my hands.

Riverside --> 96th st entrance onto hudson greenway --> uptown, there's an exit around 125th st, can go further up or loop back. 





Central park, so many routes, Google will help you here but getting around the reservoir is always fun because it just feels so much more open than any other part of the area.

-Riverside Park



-You could run down to Central Park



-Broadway



-Morningside Park if it's not dark out, but it's kinda small



-Dodge fitness center has treadmills and an indoor track if it's too hot/cold

Riverside is a cool place to run

Don't forget going north along riverside, that can mix it up if you're used to going south. While going north, if you track about a block east of the river path, there will be a trail entrance under a bridge; that trail goes far and it's really pretty. You pop out next to the water. I also like riverbank state Park for running on a soft surface (track and turf field, not too crowded). Riverside all up/down as well as the trail I mentioned have a nice soft surface for most of the way that runs along the side of the path.

DM/email @ ak6962@nyu.edu if you are interested and want to know more!

Hello everyone!





Wanted to let you know that PRET, (coffee place across the st from main entrance to CU,) offers a subscription service for coffee that's $30/month for 5 coffees per day. Including lattes, cold brew, etc. You can even add syrup. Coffee in NYC is so expensive. Joe Coffee is like 7 dollars for a latte on campus and that's kinda ridiculous. I have an espresso machine at home, and I can tell you that this is almost as economical as making your own coffee if you drink around 2 cups p/day. Wanted to give a heads up for my caffeine deprived friends ;)





I’d add a disclaimer to this post:



When you start drinking this crap every day for about 4 months, it literally tastes abominable. I forgot what real good coffee tasted like until I went off this pass. Also be prepared for insane lines that take up 10-15 minutes of your morning. They also always ran out of stuff after 12:00 somehow. No alternative milks, no cups, no ICE?? Horrid. I would recommend this pass only if you lived near a different Pret.



I get not wanting to pay also ridiculous prices for coffee elsewhere, but I’ve started buying large gallons of cold brew (I love Stok!) which is usually $3 lasting me like 3 days (I drink an abnormal amount of coffee) or go to any Blue Java (comes to around $2-4 dining dollars).



Last but not least, I’d try out the Pret pass for a while, but not forever. Despite, my complaints and negative reviews of it, because it def doesn’t break the bank it’s worth a shot. Plus the pass includes a free month of the benefits so you can cancel before it charges you. Best of luck my fellow caffeine addicts!

Great point!!

I would add that they also have some promotions such as first two (or maybe just one, not sure) months for free when signing up for the service. This was the promotion in September at least. Moreover, the cheapest plan is $20/month.

Good to know in a pinch. Thank you! Horrible coffee is still coffee ha.

It's borderline awful, but for 25 cents you can get coffee in the german department office.

Not sure why I got downvoted. If you commute to school and work, sometimes you can't make coffee at home. That simple. I love making coffee at home. I vastly prefer it as quality coffee is a *special interest* of mine, but I can't always have it.

Or just buy an aeropress and make your own

Great point!!

For those who transferred here from Cornell. Was it worth it?

I don't know that you will find a lot of transfer from Cornell to Columbia, I did my undergrad at Cornell and now am in grad school here. Not really sure why you'd transfer? I think the caliber of classes and research is very similar. In my experience in a small engineering department, Cornell was better organized and had more support available, I think partially due to larger size. I would generally say that transferring is not a great idea unless there is something specific you know you would get at another university that you don't get at your current institution, for example if there is a major you want that doesn't exist at your school. Columbia does have a bit more of a "liberal arts" thing than Cornell, but you have access to any classes you want in the Art's school, so if you wanted to craft a very rounded course load you could. I personally liked that I could just take mostly STEM classes. I knew a couple transfer students who really struggled to make friends because a lot of people form super close friendships in their first year, so would warn that it can be hard socially. Why are you considering transferring?

Rubenstein fundies curve?

Anyone knows how the grading happened? My grade was way lower than I expected even though I had a decent midterm and went to every p-credit.

Do you think he didn’t take p-credit into account?

I don't think they would make such a huge mistake? But I would love to see some sort of statistics to understand how that happened.

So weird. I feel I've done horribly in the class but went to every P-Credit and ended up with a B+. All things considered I am very, very happy with that.



I feel like there's an immense amount of confusion on how grades were calculated, I took the midterm with section 3 and while I did above average for that section I still have no idea how I actually did. And then he said something about splitting us up into 6 groups? Idk it's all very confusing

Yeah, same exact thing happened to me.

LOL. I wouldn't put it past them. But would that be so terrible? haha

Did everyone else not get their final exam grade? Wild that they can just assign us a grade without letting us know how we did on that since it is up to 60% of our grade. For all we know they could have just not graded the finals.

What grade did you get?

From the department webpage: "Course prerequisites are strictly enforced. Prerequisites must be taken before the course, not after or concurrently." Also, I have trouble believing that non-econ classes teach a sufficient amount of the principles material. *Maybe* you got the basic intuition, but the technical jargon and models (for example, aggregate supply and demand models) are almost certainly not covered elsewhere. Even if you could slip through the cracks during enrollment, you'd be far behind the curve. The class will be more technical than you expect, you're not just doing a bunch of readings. You'll be mostly covering mathematical/economic models that explain phenomena in the real world

By any chance, did you take AP Micro and Macro? If so, you do have the pre-reqs.

Specifically, any Columbia class of 2026 students going to this concert? Are you going alone or with other people. If you're going alone, do you feel safe enough navigating to Barclays. Trying to get a feel of how safe I should feel going alone.

I’m not going but there isn’t anything unsafe about navigating to the Barclays. You’ll be fine going alone

Thanks! Will PM you.

I’m going! 

I’m class of 2022 and going to the concert with a student in class of 2024. If you want people to navigate with, you could join us :)

Thanks! Will PM you.

Weird...I got a real grade. This class smh

Email alias help

So I set up my Cu email and changed it to an alias. However, whenever I try the alias out and send an email to it, it says it doesn't exist. I changed everything in my [uni@columbia.edu](mailto:uni@columbia.edu) acc so that when I send an email, it sends from the alias and it works fine. But replying or emailing the alias sends a google prompted email stating that the email I'm trying to reach doesn't exist. Any tips?

yes hello this is tech support have you tried turning it off and back on again

I've set up the alias too but can't log in using that.



For physics 1403 with Charles Hailey, does anyone know if he uses a textbook, or if any textbooks are helpful? Is it the Halliday Resnick Walker textbook that 1401 and 1402 use or no? I have to re-up my WileyPLUS subscription fairly soon, and it would be nice to know if I didn't actually have to spend another hundred dollars to access a textbook I won't use. Thanks!

Textbook for apma 2101 is Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 10th edition, William E. Boyce and Richard DiPrima



Edit: Found this page, which says we can possibly get up to 6 credits for classes taken after high school but before starting at Columba: [https://bulletin.columbia.edu/columbia-college/regulations/#placementadvancedstandingtext](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/columbia-college/regulations/#placementadvancedstandingtext)



Still wondering about the process... If anyone's done this before, can you speak to how easy or strict they were? The page says it's up to the advising dean to make a determination. Also, wasn't sure if they'd accept an online class.

cool, yeah that's the case! Do you happen to know if a course taken online would count too? I've heard some conflicting things.

yeah unfortunately we don't get assigned an advisor until way later

good to know, thanks.

as long as you havent started at columbia yet then yes

yeah unfortunately we don't get assigned an advisor until way later

good to know, thanks.

Hi all, 



Thank you!

I know someone who went on to vet school at UC Davis after attending CU. The transfer process is definitely competitive, but CC students do come to Columbia and Columbia students can go on to vet school. Not sure about the internship experience through Columbia specifically, but NYC is a great place to get experience in so many fields

Thank you!



  

You also might need to setup your signature too for the alias in the settings. Should be easy to find.

yeahhhhhh welcome to cs at columbia. the vision and graphics track isn't even an actual possibility since they haven't offered necessary classes for the track (like computer animation) for multiple semesters now. it's pretty sad

I’m upper level CS classes, you can’t just enroll in the class. Even the first person to register is put on a waitlist, which instead of being a numbered queue is “instructor controlled”. Sometimes there is a HW zero that everyone does and the highest scorers are admitted up to the class max. Sometimes they just admit people according to seniority and other factors. 





Why don’t you just want to take the prereqs first?

Thank you for your detailed reply! Excuse me but may I ask you some more questions? According to the syllabus computer vision and causal inference don't state the prerequisites clearly.. According to computer vision ii prereqs,



  

Computer vision is a diverse field, intersecting with math, physics, psychology, neuroscience, art, computer science, engineering, and philosophy. We have minimal prerequisites and the course staff will do its best to introduce concepts as we go along. The course will assume you know Python, basic linear algebra, and single variable calculus. You should be comfortable manipulating vectors and matrices, and be comfortable calculating derivatives and basic integrals. Knowledge in machine learning and statistics will be helpful, but not required.



  

This is a question only the professor can answer. At Columbia, instructors have the freedom to conduct their classes as they see fit. You should feel free to email the professor, briefly explain your situation, and ask if you would be a good match for the class.

So the good news is that prerequisites don't *really* matter for signing up for courses (unless you don't know prereq content at all and it's used heavily in the class). But the bad news is getting into popular upper level CS classes is hell, especially for underclassmen, so it's pretty likely you won't actually get a spot in them anyways. 





Definitely go in with a bunch of backups, and don't get disheartened if you can't take them this year cause you have time!

I did it all the time in the 1970s, but you need the professor or some authority to concur

Anyone interested in a TI-nspire CX Calculator?

I live in a very small rural town, and am looking to apply to Columbia next year. For people who came from similar places (or not) what are some of the biggest differences in city life?

One big thing for me has been the 24/7ness! Coming home from NYC I'm always shocked to remember that, oh yeah, if I'm hungry past 9pm I better get to the kitchen cause there sure isn't anything open. In NYC there's always a nearby grocery open, always a nearby diner open. We have 24 hour libraries in Columbia and we used to have a 24 cafeteria (hopefully again soon...?). The ability to make your own schedule is so nice, but very different.

From rural KY, here for grad school. In such a big place, it still feels horribly lonely.

Before you apply, come visit, sit in on classes, stay with students.     Nothing we tell you will feel as real as finding out on your own.    



I'd say the biggest difference between rural and city life is the pace. While I could walk outside my home in Oregon and get lost in conversation with friendly neighbors for an hour, that simply doesn't happen in NYC. People here have things to do and not enough time to do it, so everyone is in a hurry. There's the famous joke of a "New York minute", being the time it takes between a light turning green and the person behind you honking (probably 1-2 seconds). 



It's also noisy. If you are not used to sirens, you better adapt quickly, or you won't sleep. New York City has a population greater than some states in a fraction of the space, and because of that, there's a lot more noise. 



It's probably a bit more dirty. Going back to population density, that's just a natural byproduct. More people + smaller space = dirtier. 



The social atmosphere is definitely less inviting. I wouldn't say people are any less friendly in NYC than in Oregon, it's just that they're usually busy as mentioned earlier. If you find yourself being busy with them (like in class), they're perfectly pleasant (until you get to those legacy students or those born into extreme wealth). Most people at Columbia are friendly and well put together. When I was touring campus on my own time, I must've heard at least 5 different languages being spoken, it really is cool. 



I have a degree in criminology, so am happy to delve into the safety aspect too. The crime rate in NYC has had an uptick as of late, but is still a very safe city. There are certain boroughs and areas that have higher rates of incidents than others, but the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers have never been and will never be the victim of a crime. The general attitude of most students is that there is a "bubble" of a few blocks around campus where people feel very safe. Past that, and depending on which cardinal direction you're traveling, the chance that something happens rises, but is not "high" per se. 



If you have any questions, feel free to pm me.

The bigger the place the more anonymous you are. That can make it lonelier if you’re not outgoing. 



Also, maybe it’s because of the pandemic but it’s not as crowded as many rural people think it is. Shit tons of people but friends back home think it’s as crowded as Times Square on every block. It’s not. Especially the farther from Midtown you get.

There are people everywhere. It is busy pretty much everywhere, lines are long, *someone* will find out about *that quiet spot* and ruin it by posting it on insta if that hasn't already happened. It's also loud AF. Get some good ear plugs and noise canceling headphones. You will need them.





Pro tip: for quiet time in the city that also isn't scary (aka nighttime), I recommend getting up early on the weekends (or on Fridays too.) I found 2-3 early bird friends (a rarity, I know, but I'm *such* an early bird and so I found other early birds) and we'd go for nice quiet walks around the Upper West Side or to Central Park on the weekend mornings around 7-ish and then get coffee at 8/8:30 and then begin studying around 10am. So quiet. So nice. So not typical NYC. I love the quiet on the weekend mornings. Blissful.



On the surface, people in NYC are not friendly and do not really care about saying hi to you or how you're doing. Despite that,  people *are* friendly below that stony surface, but you need to put the effort in to get to know people because we're all super guarded. It comes with the territory. This is true on and off the Columbia campus. People are not warm and fuzzy. You will need to put in the work to make friends.



Some things that are great are *endless* good food and drink options of you're into that kind of thing. The art museums are among the best in the world and many are free. There is this GIGANTIC park called Central Park that makes you feel like you're not in a city when you're in it. Events are always happening / there is always something to do --this is a pro and con (I personally felt overwhelmed and did very little to venture far away from campus because I was very busy studying, but other people go all over.)

I grew up in rural TX before moving to Houston, and then moving to NYC. Houston and NYC are quite different as cities go, though all big metroplexes have certain things in common. People mentioned the noise and that’s real. It’s helpful to have headphones or a book on the subway. Taxis are way more expensive than TV and movies would have you believe where everyone’s just constantly traveling around in a taxi. Public transportation is a double edged sword.



Many parts of the city smell like pee. Even the fancy parts of NYC. This is because there is urine everywhere, mostly from people and also animals, but using the bathroom in public is like playing Where’s Waldo with your bladder and an opportunity. Go before you head out anywhere.



NYC is more diverse than wherever you’re from, so don’t make assumptions about anyone. For example, you’ll see someone who looks like they could be from your town, or the next one over….but then you ask them a question and they respond in a language you’ve never heard before. That’s general “being human” advice, but especially in a city you’ll encounter people from everywhere, and being all sorts of ways of human. Those people also have restaurants that serve the food of their people, and its usually delicious. Find them, eat and enjoy (the food…don’t go to New York and eat people). 





There’s a lot of cool free stuff to do, especially when you’re young and don’t have kids of your own. Cultural festivals, Summer concerts, art shows, etc… Go with groups of people and explore together. Join clubs/organizations and hangout with people.



Don’t cut through parks at night for safety reasons. I was always getting notices about people being mugged and stuff in Morningside Park, Riverside Park, etc. When you walk down a park staircase, those little tiny ziploc bags on the ground held drugs and not teeny sandwiches.

That's interesting. Do you just like stare at the ground the whole time?? Also there's not many people to make eye contact with where I live, like the only viable means of transportation is by car.

Lol what dude? How much you staring?

This guy is exaggerating. As long as you don’t obviously stare like a creep, 99.99% of people aren’t going to do anything weird. In fact, it’s almost like you can look however you want… because no one is making eye contact with you. 





Seriously. Don't make eye contact when you're traveling from place to place with anyone. In other parts of the US, it's just polite.



The anonymity. Nobody knows who you are. IMO that is a good thing as someone who is reserved and would rather people not do the "Hi! How are you?" routine and try to strike up a random conversation about nothing important.

A lot of people will automatically assume you're a hick if you aren't from a coast or a city. Sometimes this is fine but can get tiring when it feels like everyone thinks you're a dumbass because you're from a rural town.



* Apartments are 3-5x more expensive

* People are not as friendly unless you get to know them. Then they're very friendly because they're all lonely from being on the move so much. 





Overall, I love you opportunities of going to CU. I love the school. I like NYC. That said, I miss the mountains. I miss my parents.

people around you everywhere all the time. that was a hard adjustment for me, and tbh i'm still not completely used to it. im from a rural area where everyone is pretty spread out, whereas here there is always, always someone there. even if you think you found some secluded spot at 3 in the morning to just chill, someone inevitably show up to the exact same spot. in my experience, having a single/a space you can be alone without someone around (i.e. your room) is very important.

There's some great advice here on how to avoid standing out as "not from here"; another one is, don't walk around looking up at the tall buildings! 



One thing I love about New York is being able to get just about anywhere I want to go without getting in a car.

I'm preparing for Software Engineering technical rounds. Wonder if you guys have any suggestions on how to go about it. I'd really appreciate any resources you have in mind. 



Also looking for other people to prepare with! I was thinking about forming a Interview prep group so HMU if you'd like to join! 



I'm also buying a leetcode subscription if you want to split and save a bit!

That's what I'm trying to focus in the summer after July 1. If you are interested in studying together, feel free to dm me!

DMed you

We can also round up 50 people and buy a group membership at a discounted rate.

You can. I like to track my progress and remember which problems I’ve done and haven’t. But as long as you’re doing the work it doesn’t really matter. Good luck.

I have a split leetcode account with some friends from back home and have found using different sessions for each user to be super helpful for keeping track of each of our progress. For better and for worse this also introduces a little bit of a competitive element lol

The thing about leetcode is that while the subscription does cost a little bit, the cost-to-reward ratio is like buying bitcoin in 2007. $130 bucks now, $x,000 per month later.

for both! 😅

Grind leetcode medium and hard. Got my jobs and internships with that practice for sure. 



Know your CV backwards and forwards and make sure it's super clear--it is never good if you can't talk about stuff you list on your resume or if the skills you list are confusing.



interested!

Is the gym open to students during summer if you’re not taking summer classes?

If you pay for it

I have heard that you need to pay for a membership if you're not taking any classes.

I think bc you live on campus

Why not try it?

I think bc you live on campus

Any books I could read over the summer, that I would have to read at Columbia?

Trying to find books to read, and kinda figured it might be smart to read ones that are required at Columbia. Im at SEAS btw, so the core requirements are slightly different.



If there arent any specific ones for Columbia, I would love any personal recommendations on books to read.



Thanks!

Figure out if you want to take CC, LitHum or global core. Global core I wouldnt really worry about yet, but if you pick CC or LitHum, you can do the reading for those ahead of the curve. CC is a sophomore class but you will probably still remember the books

Lit Hum uses the Richmond Lattimore translation--that doesn't mean you shouldn't check out the Lombardo if you're interested.

Personally I prefer the Lombardo translation because I think it’s more readable. I find it easier to get caught up in the plot and characters. So, I figure if you read that over the summer, you get a good base understanding of the Iliad, which will make understanding the Lattimore translation easier.

Sounds sensible.

Read the Stanley Lombardo translation of the Iliad. Its one of my all time favorites and I think it’s on the lit hum syllabus

I’d check out Dostoevsky or Gabriel García Márquez. Both are pretty dense, but by the nature of this post I think you expected this already. I’d start with Crime and Punishment and One Hundred Years of Solitude, respectively. The latter happens to be my favorite book of all time (only perhaps challenged by The Kite Runner, which is also phenomenal but not part of the curriculum).



One last thing: they’re both best read in their original languages, those being Russian and Spanish. If you’re reading a translation, I’d recommend Pevear and Volokhonsky for Dostoevsky’s novels. Unfortunately I only read Márquez in Spanish, so I can’t recommend translators for him. Happy reading!

Okay, sweet thanks a ton!

Probably by August. I was told that we’d get an email from the Office of Student Affairs.

Okay, sweet thanks a ton!

Feasibility of SEAS MS Express Program



I would love to get your opinions on this so thanks a lot in advance!

1 semester only? Hmm, doubt it, there are many core courses needed and they are tough. I don’t think they overlap much with CS either, they are very math oriented.

Wondering if undergrads can use the spaces on 168th!

You can.

Help with Grad Housing

Hey there, My wife and I just got approved for Columbia couples housing and the whole housing without any real knowledge of a place seems crazy but I get it we are all in the same boat.



That said, I was hoping someone that currently lives in Columbia Housing or was previously in a Columbia Apartment would be willing to share some info on their building / apartment and maybe a couple photos of their  place?  



We are in California and can't really feel out the area or the buildings or anything so looking for anything that could help us with this decision.

See if you can get a spot on Riverside.



Look at the blocks from around 114th St to 120th, pretty sure Columbia owns most of those buildings. It’s a chill location with virtually no crime.

You’re post is amazing and extremely insightful. 



Coming in clutch because our window opens in 20 mins. 



Thanks again for your insights and we will definitely be looking for area & some amenities like an elevator. I might have some questions in the future but for now this has been A+++

Hey! Thanks for all this information! My wife and I will be moving to 549 Riverside Drive, so it sounds like we'll be right near you. It has been hard to find much information about this area.

It's rough! I've been in grad housing for a year and picked my place exclusively based on proximity to a friend's apartment who already lived here. Signed the lease without even seeing a floor plan. On the bright side, a lot of the buildings are really nice. My place is great, it's huge for manhattan and has beautiful wood floors.  Most people I know who are in grad housing are fairly happy, and I think those that aren't usually have the shitty bedroom in the 3 bed, which I don't think would be an issue in couples housing. 



What I wish I knew when looking at housing options: 



\-check the proximity to a subway station (125, 116, 110 and broadway). IMO, the closer the better. 



\-sound: I live on Riverside and I love it, it's quiet and I look out into a park. Broadway or Amsterdam will be louder, if its on a numbered street it's probably in the middle in terms of sound. I think there are a bunch of frats around 113/114, I would avoid but some people don't mind. 



\-Harlem is just uptown from campus, it starts at 125th, and the vibe definitely changes when you cross that street. I live \~124 and Riverside (although this doesn't actually exist, it's called tiemann) and I like the area, I'm happy to go into Harlem but it is a little different than the Columbia/morningside heights bubble. There are a few groceries stores around but proximity to those is also important.



Basically, you have to make your decision based on location and hope you get a nice place, and chances are pretty good that you will. If you can, get a building with an elevator. Happy to answer more questions!

Barnard bio

What have been your experiences taking bio @ Barnard? I’ve heard that it’s a lot of memorization, but how do you best recommend doing well?

Hey guys, sorry if these posts are tiring but I was accepted as a sophomore transfer and am still deciding what I’m gonna do so I hope you can help me out. 





I appreciate anyone who can help with this, thanks.

That’s great to hear, thank you. I’ll look out for that email and see what other Core requirements I’m able to get out of, really just hoping for at least part of the language.

The process is more or less like what you said. You just submit your essay and wait for it to get reviewed. If I remember correctly, they also asked for the syllabus of the course for which you wrote the essays. Ideally, you wanna submit essays that involve both single and multiple sources (I only wrote essays with a single source and didnt get the exemption).

I wish you luck, but It's notoriously difficult to get Columbia to wave UW. I had also taken a similar class at my previous school and they didn't even transfer the credits lmao. That being said, Columbia's writing courses are really enjoyable. It was one of my favorite classes so far.

That’s great to hear, thank you. I’ll look out for that email and see what other Core requirements I’m able to get out of, really just hoping for at least part of the language.















It's as easy as you make it. The support is there, but you still have to try. You may not get experience directly at irving, but there are other places too. It's all in what's available. 



  







  





No idea. You'd have to ask an advisor. 



  





Yes. 



  





Don't look at it like surviving. Fall in love with academics and you'll do great. Or at least act as though you are. Good GPAs for med school here are around 3.5 at least. It's not terribly hard to do that well here. probably around 60+ hours per week of studying. For gen chem 1 and 2, pre study those classes, as they move quick, and they're not taught well. It gets better as you take harder classes. They're typically taught better than survey courses.

1. Pretty accessible, as there are many different opportunities around (Vagelos, CUIMC, Mt Sinai, MSK, NYPresbyterian, etc). Just depends on how far you’re willing to travel



2. It depends on what you do more so than “Columbia”—some people have gone to Harvard and some haven’t. I would say the only benefit Columbia has are networking opportunities (e.g. work w/ a prof at your target school and get a good rec letter). The premed advisory committee is very focused on seniors (in my experience), and thus not rly useful before then



3. Yes, there are work study jobs working in labs. If you DM me I can send descriptions for a few, but I believe they involved typical wet lab stuff (pipetting, cleaning, etc)



4. Yes



5. Same thing others have said, you really have to dedicate a lot of time towards your classes to do well. I would say join as many premed clubs as possible and have as many study groups as possible, more ppl in the same boat make it so much more bearable. Also I’m sure you’re aiming for a 4.0, but keep your mental health in mind, as it’s very possible to put in 100% effort into a class but still get less than an A. So don’t go too crazy, meet good ppl and you’ll be fine, good luck!

If you're a freshman or sophomore, you're doing scut work as the cleaner and inventory person. If your PI is generous, he may let you do a few other things like take notes. They know perfectly well that while as overinflated an underclassman's ego is, they don't have the experience or knowledge to be trusted with more important tasks. That trust has to be earned.

At best, maybe last on authorship and that's if the professor is nice.



They're very accessible. But you have to be proactive and do the work finding the opportunities yourself.

  



  



  



  



Yes.

  



  



Sure.

Iconic locations on or near campus?

I’m starting at TC this fall and am curious about any particular diners, restaurants, bars, etc, students frequent. I’m trying to get a sense of the social life and community (if there is one). I’m also hoping to learn of personal and memorable locations/people/things to do on campus, whether that be your favorite library floor, your favorite meal at the dining hall, or a shortcut! Any suggestions or memories are welcome :)

As someone who graduated a...long while ago and recently moved back to the neighborhood, your response really made me sad. There were a great many student-loved restaurants, bars, and other spaces, and many are gone. And even the ones that aren't are not on your list. A halal food cart, Pret (a desk job lunch chain with 200 locations in the city), an on-campus coffee takeout joint? How tedious is your life? The Heights, Arts and Crafts, Hex and Co, Symposium, Lion's Den, 1020, Suite, West End Lounge, Koronet, Pisticci, Toast, Wu and Nussbaum, Miss Mamie's Spoonbread 2, Massawa... Sure, there's no more Smoke, Abbey, West End, Mama Mexico, Cannon's...that bar where sorority girls with low self esteem danced on the bar, but there are still options that aren't soul-sucking. Also, they should bring back the bar in Furnald.

The Hungarian Pastry Shop, Hooda's Halal Food (gets very busy around midnight), Pret a Manger, and Joe's (Northwest Corner Building). 



Congrats and all the best!!

Shelburne hall insiders



I’m an international student and I’ve never been to the U.S before and just wondering what kind of accessories, essentials and decorations I might want to bring from home. 





If anyone has pictures/reviews/have lived/is living there would you please share either here or message me? 

I really want to see the building/ apartments from inside. 



Enjoy your Summer 

Thanks

Thank you so much for sharing. These are really helpful points. I would be depressed without natural light so definitely will look on the south side of the building. Also, AC would have never crossed my mind as we have them installed in every household in my hometown. I saw the park on street view on Google maps and that’s definitely a plus. I’ll keep in mind the grocery store you mentioned. Thanks for the pictures really helpful.

I used to live there. It’s pretty decent for university housing. The layout can be a little awkward because it’s usually a long hallway with two bedrooms and the kitchen along one wall, with the living room at one end of the hall and a third bedroom at the other end of the hall. I personally think the living room is too small for a get together unless you’re only inviting a handful of people. A big problem is that there is another building a couple of yards from the north side of it so you’re not guaranteed to have natural light. I didn’t mind before Covid but it was mentally draining on me after classes moved online. Make sure you’re living on the south side of the building which has natural light if you care about that. Another problem is that the laundry/garbage/recycling is in the basement. As far as I’m aware the only way to get to that basement is an elevator and that elevator broke down a handful of times while I was living there. Also if you get the middle room (which I had) it is by far the smallest. I think it’s half the size of the largest bedroom. Attached is a picture from my bedroom when I first moved in. 



https://i.imgur.com/kVihXmq.jpg



Edit: I will say that the location is incredible though. Right off the park + a very quick walk to the university. Appletree is close by too which is a good grocery store (albeit pricey for some things) + has a nice deli. 



Also you’ll definitely want a fan or an AC unit if you plan to be there over a summer.



Edit 2: here’s a better picture of what you can expect the room size to be.

Laptop recommendations for MS Mechanical Engineering Robotics track

So I’ve heard that mostly SolidWorks is used on campus, and it obviously has compatibility issues with Macs. That said, Fusion 360 runs great on them. 



Do Macs work for MSME?

Oh, alright. Thanks!

Oh, alright. Thanks!

Nice

Actually, ed was pretty responsive for this class the whole semester, it’s just now that it’s strange that it became so quiet

Agreed! The TAs and Prof always communicated different things. My TA said that our lowest hw would be dropped and the Prof said no at the end of the semester .

This whole semester it feels like Profs and TAs just ignored everyone’s questions on Ed. No consequences, of course.

It’s a legitimate complaint.



Columbia is a business, first and foremost. We pay to attend, we have timelines we as paying customers have to meet, so professors should adhere to timelines as well.

LMAO

Hunter Holland is a bootlicking bitch!

That's crazy.  I received grades more quickly while TA's were on strike mid-pandemic.

I’d be grateful for any locality recommendations in the area as well, thank you!





It's pretty safe on the UES, and any subway stops in between, so safety shouldn't be a concern. But just know that your commute will be 45 minutes or more to travel between the two sides if you're only using subways. Buses can cut that down to like 30 minutes depending on whether or not you want to use the buses and whether or not there's a bus stop near your place that goes to Morningside.





Safety also depends on where you end up in the UES, so definitely check out the [NYC Crime Map](https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/) to figure out which precinct you'd be in.





For me personally, I'd recommend trying to find a place on the UWS, or if you love the UES then think about getting a moped or something that can cut down your commute time.

If the weather is nice, a bike will be faster than the subway and more pleasant. The UES is a big place, so this depends on where.

Timing will depend on where on the UES. There's a good deal of area (East/West and North/South) and where you are located and proximity to the subway or bus will make a big difference. You can hop a crosstown bus to the West Side and take the 1 train up to Columbia. You can also get to the M4 bus which goes up Madison, crosses West at 110th and then right up to Columbia. None of these are particularly dangerous routes but everyone has their own assessment of risk. 



It's totally doable if you're committed to the UES or have some affinity for it or some great opportunity. But my $0.02 is that if you're going to to commute 30-45 minutes, there are more interesting neighborhoods.

Wouldn't recommend it. It's much easier to travel north/south than east/west in NYC, especially through central park. Unless you have a partner living over there or some amazing deal on rent, I'd highly recommend something on the west side

not the same as living but had a good friend live on 3rd Ave and 116th that I visited often. 



commute was the m116 bus which only has a stop at 106th in broadway or get off the bus earlier and cross morningside park which I dont recommend for safety reasons and for the amount of stairs





I would always uber when it was late at night because of how far the bus stop was. what's nice is that uber was never more than 15$ and could be as cheap as 8$



it really depends where on the east side you're going, check the bus routes if you really want to do east side. people saying it's 40 mins are right if you're doing public transport



Plenty of decent neighborhoods in Harlem too. South of 125th around 8th Ave and west from there. Close walk to campus up through the park...

is this feasible if so how



I get yk shocked by the like 6% transfer rate 



Even though yk SEAS doesn’t need to do the core.



How can I get in via transfer. 





It is possible. Just get good grades, be real with ur profs on why u want to transfer and send it. 



Good luck

Transferred from Cornell. Feel free to dm

Hi all,









Also, any additional suggestions are welcome.





Check out a concentration instead.  You don't actually have to have a major here, just an area of study.

GS may have different requirements but this is what CC and SEAS students have to abide by

The CS requirements for CC and GS are the same: [https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/c/d.php?d=271](https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/c/d.php?d=271)



They were also updated recently on the link. The CS core is 24 ish credits + 15 ish credits for your track, and you need to also fulfil the Calc requirement.

As it currently stands the CS core is as follows:





Then you ~21 credits of track courses from the approved tracks. So about 7 classes there. Then you need 15 credits of gen technical requirements so about 5 classes there



So we are looking at 60 credit hours worth for the major plus what other requirements you have to meet. 



Do you know what you’d like to do post-graduation?

Product/ux design

You can look into the information science major, I also had to finish my major in 2 years and I am very happy with infosci!

You may want to consider only doing a concentration, rather than a major. It’ll be less classes so a more manageable schedule





That being said, Columbia is very difficult - especially to blaze through. I understand you're ambitious, believe me lol, but don't commit to something that may make your life hell for 2 years in a hasty decision. CS is very interesting, but chill out cause you already have a job my guy. I say target an easy schedule at Columbia and fill up the remaining time with a few of the most important CS classes like Data Structures, AP, Algorithms, maybe OS etc.

I think you can do it if you take summer classes. Coming in with 60 credits it will take me 2.5 years, with 1 summer class and no overloaded semesters. If you're the type that can handle 18 credit semesters that's an option too but it will be painful.

Great thank you!

The charge will be removed later. You don’t need to pay. 



Edit: this is applicable if you’re in CC or SEAS

How do I build a good impression under the professor? Not a teacher's pet kind.

If you show up prepared to every class and engage, the teacher will know you and will probably know your name. If you want to go the extra mile then go to office hours as well, but I got amazing letters of rec from teachers without ever going to an office hours.

Not kidding, this is all you need.





[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTqiryumeoA) \- Long breakdown





[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmhfOjuAaew) \- Shorter Breakdown





The basic gist is that preparation is better than anything you can do. It may sound awful, and often times it is, but it is so much more time efficient to be prepared for a class prior to lecture than it is to learn the material for the first time in lecture. This isn't always possible but it's possible like 90% of the time, and if you're disciplined about being prepared for every lecture you'll probably find you have so much more free time than you'd expect.

Are Professors understanding and friendly?

All of mine have been so far, they’ve even gone out of their way on several occasions to make me feel comfortable when I asked a question I thought was silly or too basic. One other thing you can do is go to the TA’s office hours, which are also super helpful and there’s maybe a bit less pressure because it’s a slightly more casual environment.

Super important: ***don't be afraid to ask for help!***

Grades are fake and don't matter. Just do your best.

Honestly hard work and smart work don't always bring good grades, my question is more focused on the exclusive strategies as a Columbia student. Managing internships and coursework is one hell of a Herculean task, any say on the approach ?

Get good grades

What specific culture do you have in mind Mr. Hovercraft ?

That includes the hedge fund kids who have people do all their essays for them, or maybe the athletes who struggle to draw a supply curve in my econ class. Americans are famous for cultural appropriation, I don't think they will leave out the cheating culture either :((

You should take a break from social media for a while. 



Trust me you’ll feel better.

I am already feeling good. This is because I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now...

It takes a lot of work and other people have answered your core question.

Are you a current CC/SEAS student? The new financial aid update is being applied to all packages going forward, it's not a separate thing that you specifically apply for. If you're a prospective student, just apply for fin aid when you apply for admission

Where did you see this info?

what do you think about central Harlem?

merci de ta réponse. Je vois ce que tu veux dire, les gens ont tellement des avis différents mais j’ai l’impression que c’est pas létal d’habiter la bas mais ça reste plus dangereux qu’ailleurs

West African Francophone here. Studied in France and knows the suburbs of Paris. Harlem is nicer than most of those places in the Banlieue. I live in Morningside Heights but would definitely live in Harlem if I found a good housing offer there. I actually spend a lot of my free time in Harlem. And again, as said by @Brandywine5, violent crimes against Columbia students as of late happened right next to campus.

It does not FEEL safe, but it is generally as safe as anywhere else in NY.





You’d somewhat stand out there.

I’m a girl and lived in harlem for a few months, I definitely did not like the area and living there, but it was generally safe. I walked at night home so many times and it was okay.

Data is your friend here.   

https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/

I grew up in the hood in LA so I feel you. What feels “safe” may not have the same definition for others

Thanks for the feedback 🫶

Cannot upvote this enough. I'm originally from upstate NY (hour and a half north of the city) and what I consider "safe" differs from what someone who I grew up on the UWS considers to be safe. Manhattan is generally safe compared to other parts of the city, and it is generally safer than other cities in the state.



Thanks for the feedback and the little tips, I’ll try my best to get near these areas 👌🏼

It won’t feel as safe as living further south, but it’s obv doable otherwise all these kids wouldn’t defend it so much.



If you have non-Harlem options though, maybe look into those. It’s definitely more “hood” than people are willing to admit.



If you can, you should look into housing on Riverside or south of 116th. Much better imo and close to campus.



Overall though, Harlem is a nice neighborhood. The locals are friendly, there's a lot of good food and the growing West African enclaves are always fun to check out. And too, all neighborhoods have problems, even if they are not immediately apparent.

Fair enough, I cannot speak to a woman's lived experience about which NYC neighborhoods are safer than others. To clarify, the women I lived with in Harlem thought it was fine, but there were others when I was living near Columbia who would never venture east of Morningside Heights. Race and size played a part in that as well, so makes sense that different women had different threat perceptions.



Sorry you have to deal with all that though. My ex said that she experienced a lot more catcalling and harassment in NYC when walking by herself since the pandemic started. Way too much asshole behavior these days.

Agreed! And thank you for being so understanding! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️



My understanding talking to the dude from Burkina Faso is that there is a pretty vibrant West African community there by the way. So that could help with feeling safe if you are able to make friends around there.

Shrine is an excellent bar with live music and shows right there.

Maybe some people are talking about race, but if you view the maps.nyc.gov/crime/ that Deimateos posted, you'll see that crime is significantly higher in harlem. Especially of the sexual assault/rape kind. If you go to CU, you should understand raw data enough to not politicize factual information. There’s nothing inherently racist about fearing for your safety, especially as NYC has had some relatively high murder rates during and since COVID. 



I used to live in some of the most heroin/crime filled parts of the coast, and I agree that what you said is good advice. That being said, it doesn’t negate factual information.

Crime is significantly higher in Harlem compared to what? If you look at a crime map, you’ll see Central Harlem is safer or equivalent to almost the entirety of downtown and midtown Manhattan/the majority of the Bronx/parts of Brooklyn. While it is less “safe” than Morningside heights, Hamilton heights, and UWS/UES — it isn’t any more significantly unsafe than most of Manhattan. 



And when you compare Columbia’s Morningside Heights (26th precinct) to (28th precinct) Central Harlem (1.2 crimes per 1000, and 1.5 crimes per 1000, respectively) it is a negligible difference — the real big difference is how demographic makeup (aka race) alters people’s perception of how safe an area is. 



I might get downvoted for this, but I think since you are brown, you will blend in and not have any problems. I’ve spent time around there and have not had any trouble. 



Behave the same way you would in Paris. Don’t talk to strangers when walking at night. Don’t walk with your phone out. Etc…

And also, the location you mentioned is nice! Close to Harlem Grows, Harlem hops, good park nearby, good subway access, lots of schools, and good food.

Guns and drugs can be anywhere in NYC, doesn’t matter what neighborhood. That area of Harlem is safe — there is a decline in total crime and increased patrol. The worst gun and drug problems in Harlem cluster around NYCHA/East Harlem, sadly. Downtown/midtown/Bronx/parts of Brooklyn are comparatively more crime-ridden and dangerous than CH, statistically.

Notice I specifically mentioned sexual assault and murder. The OP was asking about safety, so I specified to crimes that had to do with that. Grand larceny almost never involves violence. Same with property crimes etc. apples and oranges my friend! 



I’m not sure what could be biased by observing sexual assault and murder, but if you’re implying that cops are more likely to report sexual assault in central Harlem, that would go against the idea that sexual assault is underreported even though that’s well understood. Rape is a self reported crime, and murder is… murder. So it’s hard to mess with that data. It is what it is. 



When you look at the data with the correct metrics in mind, (the ones I specified that you ignored) you’ll realize why people are cautious about living in Harlem. Personally, I would live in Harlem. It’s a lot more like where I came from. My roommates wouldn’t do it though.

I get what you mean by that don’t worry, same logic apply about « blending » in some surburbs in Paris. Thanks for the feedback

Thank you for the alternative feedback that kind of reassuring me.

You said “crime” is significantly higher in Harlem overall — even though you gave nothing to compare it to lol. Higher than what? (I ask, again). 



Fear and racism makes some Columbia students apprehensive about Harlem. Statistically Central Harlem is safe — and Harlem is a great place to live, just mind your business and you’re good. Safety varies block by block, with streets closest to Central Park being generally safest (110-116).

thank you for your answer, that’s what I thought in the first place.

not safe at all

thank you for your answer

Don't

That’s the problem, I find a trustworthy agency (they already rent a room to a girl which gave me a good feedback) and it’ll need me to engage to keep it for me 🙃

Not great. Hesitate to say don’t do it but if you’re coming from France you might want to evaluate for yourself before committing.

Sorry you have to deal with all that though. My ex said that she experienced a lot more catcalling and harassment in NYC when walking by herself since the pandemic started. Way too much asshole behavior these days.

Agreed! And thank you for being so understanding! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️



Overall though, Harlem is a nice neighborhood. The locals are friendly, there's a lot of good food and the growing West African enclaves are always fun to check out. And too, all neighborhoods have problems, even if they are not immediately apparent.

Crime is significantly higher in Harlem compared to what? If you look at a crime map, you’ll see Central Harlem is safer or equivalent to almost the entirety of downtown and midtown Manhattan/the majority of the Bronx/parts of Brooklyn. While it is less “safe” than Morningside heights, Hamilton heights, and UWS/UES — it isn’t any more significantly unsafe than most of Manhattan. 



And when you compare Columbia’s Morningside Heights (26th precinct) to (28th precinct) Central Harlem (1.2 crimes per 1000, and 1.5 crimes per 1000, respectively) it is a negligible difference — the real big difference is how demographic makeup (aka race) alters people’s perception of how safe an area is. 



Notice I specifically mentioned sexual assault and murder. The OP was asking about safety, so I specified to crimes that had to do with that. Grand larceny almost never involves violence. Same with property crimes etc. apples and oranges my friend! 



I’m not sure what could be biased by observing sexual assault and murder, but if you’re implying that cops are more likely to report sexual assault in central Harlem, that would go against the idea that sexual assault is underreported even though that’s well understood. Rape is a self reported crime, and murder is… murder. So it’s hard to mess with that data. It is what it is. 



When you look at the data with the correct metrics in mind, (the ones I specified that you ignored) you’ll realize why people are cautious about living in Harlem. Personally, I would live in Harlem. It’s a lot more like where I came from. My roommates wouldn’t do it though.

You said “crime” is significantly higher in Harlem overall — even though you gave nothing to compare it to lol. Higher than what? (I ask, again). 



Maybe some people are talking about race, but if you view the maps.nyc.gov/crime/ that Deimateos posted, you'll see that crime is significantly higher in harlem. Especially of the sexual assault/rape kind. If you go to CU, you should understand raw data enough to not politicize factual information. There’s nothing inherently racist about fearing for your safety, especially as NYC has had some relatively high murder rates during and since COVID. 



I used to live in some of the most heroin/crime filled parts of the coast, and I agree that what you said is good advice. That being said, it doesn’t negate factual information.

I might get downvoted for this, but I think since you are brown, you will blend in and not have any problems. I’ve spent time around there and have not had any trouble. 



Behave the same way you would in Paris. Don’t talk to strangers when walking at night. Don’t walk with your phone out. Etc…

And also, the location you mentioned is nice! Close to Harlem Grows, Harlem hops, good park nearby, good subway access, lots of schools, and good food.

Guns and drugs can be anywhere in NYC, doesn’t matter what neighborhood. That area of Harlem is safe — there is a decline in total crime and increased patrol. The worst gun and drug problems in Harlem cluster around NYCHA/East Harlem, sadly. Downtown/midtown/Bronx/parts of Brooklyn are comparatively more crime-ridden and dangerous than CH, statistically.

I get what you mean by that don’t worry, same logic apply about « blending » in some surburbs in Paris. Thanks for the feedback

Thank you for the alternative feedback that kind of reassuring me.

thank you for your answer, that’s what I thought in the first place.

thank you for your answer

That’s the problem, I find a trustworthy agency (they already rent a room to a girl which gave me a good feedback) and it’ll need me to engage to keep it for me 🙃

c’est à dire double diplôme?

Cannot upvote this enough. I'm originally from upstate NY (hour and a half north of the city) and what I consider "safe" differs from what someone who I grew up on the UWS considers to be safe. Manhattan is generally safe compared to other parts of the city, and it is generally safer than other cities in the state.

Agreed! And thank you for being so understanding! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Fair enough, I cannot speak to a woman's lived experience about which NYC neighborhoods are safer than others. To clarify, the women I lived with in Harlem thought it was fine, but there were others when I was living near Columbia who would never venture east of Morningside Heights. Race and size played a part in that as well, so makes sense that different women had different threat perceptions.

Question for alums...

I think it depends. Things like Microsoft subscriptions terminate quickly.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. More sophisticated companies & more expensive subs are wise to permanent emails & make you go through a verification process.

You should definitely take Calc 2 as well imo.



Yeah, I know. And that’s a mistake imo.



It’s doable. Columbia offers pre-calc if you’re really worried, but chances are you could just do a little bit of self-study and be fine for calc 1 and then 3. 



Really important is to choose the right professor though; some professors are a LOT better at teaching math than others.

Yeah, I know. And that’s a mistake imo.

Get to Know Each Other for CVN Students (and on Campus Students!)

Hey yall,





Recently in one of my courses we had get-to-know-each-other sessions where three students are put in one Zoom room for a period of time each week and I think it would be cool to bring into the bigger Columbia community for us CVN students to connect with each other. I think it was also great since it personalizes the experiences as well (with having a few people to meet each week in a random grouping compared to the whole network in a Zoom room chatting at once).



If you're currently studying on campus, would really love to get to know you as well, so feel free to join too! Would be great to get some people to know and hang out with when coming over to New York for either taking courses or for graduation (both are in my plans at the moment at least)!



If you're interested in this, I've made a discord at [https://discord.gg/eKbNWERy](https://discord.gg/eKbNWERy), but feel free to also DM me/comment below as well; happy to connect! Do suggest other ways of connecting or doing things if you have any as well!



Available room in very large very reasonable apartment in Harlem.





Rent and utilities run about $1450 and the apartment itself is seriously spacious and modern. 



If you or anyone you know is looking for a room this summer and into the fall school semester please feel free to message me. I’d love to get this great spot into a Columbia students hands! 



Cheers!

Whittier Hall

I have the chance to live in Whittier Hall this upcoming school year. Should I take it? Has anyone ever lived in Whittier or known anyone who has? It’s an old dorm at Columbia University. Interested in any experiences you’ve had or heard of in this dorm.



I've heard that finance consultants are very negligent , so should I be resolute from Day 1, i.e., since the day i enter the gates. And also keep insisting the consultants from time to time ?

Hello, I have been admitted as a transfer to Georgia Tech CS and Columbia GS CS as a sophomore transfer. May I ask you some questions about Columbia CS and GS?



1. Is there any undergraduate student who works with professor Elias Bareinboim? I am really interested in causality in Machine Learning and I really want to work with professor Bareinboim. Or is there any undergraduate student who works with professor Carl Vondrick? His researches are very intriguing as well. Is it very hard to work with these professors as undergraduate?

3. Can you take graduate classes in CS, Math and Statistics as undergrad? Also, there's no declaration requirements or restrictions like Berkeley when declaring cs/math/statistics, right?

4. Finally, is there a lot of disadvantage for being a GS student? I was wondering why so many people describe themselves as CC/SEAS/Bernard/GS student instead of Columbia Uni student. It seems there are clear divide within the school... Is the atmosphere hostile to one another?



I am an international student and I am planning to apply for ML phd programs in America. Money is not an issue for me. Thank you!

2: Never had an issue with the size of CS classes, I've gotten into every CS course I've wanted to take including those that required an application/interview to get in (mainly the 4995 classes). Also have gotten to know CS profs and was a TA for one for a while.





4: Like the other commenter said the only disadvantage is less aid compared to the other undergraduate schools. There is no hostility.. the university is just organized in a decentralized way. Another example is that each department pays TA's a different amount, there's like four different offices for student housing, three different public safety offices, etc. It's just the way the university is organized. The stigma you may have read online regarding GS, IMO, is more related to your age than the school you go to.

Thank you for your reply! Would I have to get A/A+ in multiple courses and related projects to join Professor Vondrick's lab? I've heard in Berkeley, one has to get A+ in certain courses and have related projects to join a ML lab and I am wondering this is the case in Columbia as well





Thank you for your detailed reply! I am sorry to bother you but may I ask you some more questions? Do ML professors at Columbia allocate enough time to   



Also do professors like David Blei work with undergrads?



Thank you again for your help!

Yea np. That’s less of a Columbia/Berkeley thing and more just any lab in general. If it’s a larger, well known lab then you’ll probably work with a PhD instead of the PI. If it’s smaller/more niche/newer then you’ll probably work directly with the PI. 



Carl has a bunch of PhD students and post-grads so probably working with them. Not sure how big prof Blei’s lab is but he’s super busy (always giving talks) so I would assume he’s also pretty unavailable lol.

Thank you so much for your help! I am interested in vision as well and I was surprised by the placement of professor Vondrick's undergrad researchers(according to his website one went to MIT and the other went to Berkeley) It seems he advised his students well. Are there a lot of students from his lab who went to good phd programs?

I know Carl works with undergrads, he has ~2-4 in his lab right now. Pretty sure it’s as easy as having a background in computer vision (e.g. taking his class) then emailing him.



Not sure about Bareinboim

>Only stigma is that GS students annoyingly set high curves in STEM classes.



Thank you for your reply! Do you mean that GS students are pushing the average grade higher? Are all the classes curved so that if you're below the average you will get a bad grade even though the average is like 93?

They have the highest avr GPA. Mostly because of the extra competitive nontraditional premedical program. No one's butthurt about it, it's just slightly daunting if you're in a class with a lot of GS students. Lol.

Never felt any stigma. Only stigma is that GS students annoyingly set high curves in STEM classes. That's about it.

2. CS classes can be pretty large since there are a lot of CS majors. I’m sure if you visit the office hour often, you should be able to get closer with the professors.



3. Pretty sure you can take grad classes but you probably need to take the prereq obviously. For major declaration, i think u just declare what you wanna major (at least thats what i did)



4. The only disadvantage i can think of is GS students get less aid (which may not even apply to you since you are international anyways). Other than that, everyone takes the same classes, and I havent noticed any hostility among students from different schools, so I wouldnt worry too much about that.

Thank you so much for your detailed reply! It's amazing that undergrads can work with professors so highly regarded in their respective fields. I am sorry to bother you but may I ask you some more questions? Is getting into lab(professor Bareinboim's and Vondrick's labs) as simple as getting good grades (A/A+) at the classes that the professors teach or would I have to prepare some kinds of projects to demonstrate my capabilities? I've heard in some universities(Berkeley), some professors require multiple A+ in relevant courses and projects in order to join their labs... I am wondering this is the case in Columbia as well.

1. I have a friend who worked with professor Bareinboim as a biomedical engineering major. Both professors have taken undergrad students, but in my (arbitrary) view professor Bareinboim might be slightly more willing to take new students only because professor Vondrick already has a lot of students who want to work with him.  

A good criterion to look at is if the professor teaches a class. It should be relatively possible to work with any professor that teaches classes that undergrads can attend.)

The waitlists are pretty big (especially for classes related to machine learning) and some classes require you to take a test and be in the top x%, some classes require you to fill out a survey, etc.   

I don't think getting to know a professor is hard (even for the biggest classes) simply because not many students reach out personally to the professors to begin with. Showing up during office hours and sending some emails expressing your genuine interest should be sufficient.

3. Absolutely, a lot of my friends (including myself) have taken graduate-level classes since our freshman/sophomore years. Columbia's pretty lenient on that part, thankfully.  

Although there are prerequisites the professors don't check if you've taken the classes (most classes don't, but some restricted classes might) so it's your own responsibility that you know the prereqs (some classes also have an aptitude test as mentioned earlier to make sure you're ready for the class).   

There are no strict restrictions, but there are classes that are restricted to certain majors or grades. In these cases, you can shoot an email to the professor and ask if you can take the class.

4. No, not at all! Well, I'm in SEAS so I might not be in the right position to talk about this, but in terms of getting research positions and class registration, you won't be disadvantaged in any way (at least not that I know of) because you're in GS (well, it wouldn't make any sense to be at a disadvantage just because you're not in CC or SEAS).

Great comments from the other contributors. I’ll just say congrats on being accepted, both are outstanding institutions.

Any advice on preparing for Data Structures?

Pmed



That being said all the information I am giving you is based off knowledge of Blaer's 1004 and 3134 (as I just finished that sequence this past year) 



For someone who has rather limited experience in Java while I do not recommend taking them concurrently in the event you have a light schedule and want to devote the time there is no reason you shouldn't be able to succeed. 



-how to write a Java program 

-iterations and conditionals 

-basic algorithms 

-interfaces 

-recursion 



That is quite a simplified version of it, I have the full list if you would like of topics for both courses. 



Interfaces and Recursion are the main ones there as they are used extensively in Data Structures. 



Especially since the department labels 3134 as a 2nd year course in the bulletin you aren't "getting ahead" by doing them concurrently. 



Also I believe they are also redesigning the courses a tad bit to get rid of the theory intensive stuff in 1004 and putting some introductory data structures knowledge in there and then changing data structures to reflect that although 1004 changes I believe will be effective in the fall DS will start it's new curriculum in the Spring (since it's a sequence after all) 



That way Blaer can fully test out the new curriculum, since he will be the first to teach both the new 1004 and the new 3134 according to this plan which is subject to changes of course, I only know this as a TA of the other 1004 professor. 



Professor Blaer also likes to comment on CS related things in the reddit so I'm sure he's bound to show up here sooner or later, if he does indeed show up, hello professor :D

Yes, this is ambitious. Programming, like math, is one of those things you just can't fake competency in. Either your code compiles, or it doesn't.





1. Programming necessitates a different way of thinking; a structured thought process with a lot of patience. Like art, you may have a knack for this, it may come easy for you, it may not.



2. A college class is still *just* a college class. What I mean by that is: you are fed content by the instructor, you complete an assignment based on that content, you take some test, you get a grade based on how you do. What I noticed in school is that, regardless of the subject, the A students are probably still gonna be A students, the B students are still prob gonna be B students etc. 



Typically, the disciplined kids who pay very close attention to project details, and who constantly go to office hours will still do well, even if they don't totally understand programming. So if you're one of these kids, you can do well in class by just doing school as you've been doing. Learn, read, ask questions, pay close attention to project details.

You don’t need to lol





b.) I highly recommend Fahim from educative.io’s 1004-style crash course https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-object-oriented-programming-in-java and his 3134 coding interview review (https://www.educative.io/courses/data-structures-coding-interviews-java AND https://www.educative.io/courses/algorithms-coding-interviews-java).  



For more detailed concept-by-concept review, try Geeks4Geeks site at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/?ref=shm AND https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm.  It’s not everything you’ll need to get above the mean in 1004 & 3134, but it’s a damn good start.  



Beats the f*ck outta memorizing the textbook, eh?  Something Jian Yang from HBO’s “Silicon Valley” would definitely do… https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJhA8jjcSM.

It's certainly doable. I know someone who previously didn't know any Java when he took Data Structures, and ended up getting an A+. I wouldn't worry, Data Structures is a fairly easy class in my experience.

Xavier Intermediate Macro Notes/ Textbook

Is anyone willing to share their notes, or syllabus for the course? I heard he doesn’t use a textbook and I would like to get started during the summer to not fall behind. Thanks!

He makes his own textbook 



However, I’m ngl, it’s legit hard to understand his textbook unless you go to lecture. There’s so much fluff and useless stuff

DM me your uni or email, and I'll send both his "lecture notes" (which replace the textbook) and the syllabus (and maybe some other nuggets I can find too)!

I have heard a lot of horror stories about these classes. Any tips/advice/heads up for these classes?

The 4000 level intro to stats, the professor spent most of the sesh discouraging people from taking it. Said you’d be lucky to finish the midterm in half a day, a lot of people have to pull all-nighters. 



So I took 1201 instead and it wasn’t bad.

in stat, we used the devore textbook and i found it to be a lot more useful than lecture. It’ll be made a lot easier the more calculus knowledge you have. We did double integrals which is a topic in calc iv.

Micro, take Nyman if u can 



1201, they're all going to suck

Take STAT 1201 with Robbins.



 Intermediate Micro is not difficult as long as you stay on top of everything––to be honest, I think it is the easiest class in the Econ department. Some professors are more mathematically rigorous than others, but I think overall it should not be hard.

Transfer Registration

If you come across this post I hope that you are having a good Monday afternoon!







Thanks so much for anyone's help, it truly means a lot!

That's really reassuring to hear. Thanks so much for your help!

You'll have no prob getting into pre-health courses.  It's the computer science department that's over-enrolled like a state school.



During registration, focus on getting a seat in your core classes.  Desired global cores and language classes fill up quickly.

Thank you for your advice and for explaining the registration system!







Thank you so much! I really appreciate your time in writing such a detailed response. Also, I am a rising sophomore and it's so great that you mention Barnard because I really wanted to take my Intro Bio courses there (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's the 1500 sequence). If you don't mind me asking, are the Biology courses in a similar waitlist situation or are there any other restrictions I need to know about?



Your first registration appointment will be before the first-years register. If you are a Columbia College student, you will need to sign yourself up for Lit Hum; there will be some space in every section when registration opens to transfer students, so hopefully you can find a time slot that works. Instructors will not yet be listed--just choose days/time that work.



Are you a sophomore? Have you taken a year of General Chemistry? If so, you need to take Intro Bio; most pre-health sophomores double it up with physics and the 1-point physics lab both semesters. PHYS 1201 and, in the spring, 1202, the most basic level, is sufficient for College students and I don't believe there is any advantage to taking a higher level. There should be plenty of space in the class.



It's nice if you can get into a global core; you can put yourself on some wait lists and see what happens. You can try for a spot in The Science of Psychology (PSYC UN1001) or the equivalent Barnard class Intro to Psych (PSYC BC1001). This may also be a waitlist situation, and you may not end up getting in, but you can give it a shot.

That's really helpful! I hope there's at least a few spots in any core class.

Core classes fill up fast so try to get in those even if the time slot isn't so great

That's really reassuring to hear. Thanks so much for your help!

Thank you for your advice and for explaining the registration system!

Also, I am a rising sophomore and it's so great that you mention Barnard because I really wanted to take my Intro Bio courses there (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's the 1500 sequence). If you don't mind me asking, are the Biology courses in a similar waitlist situation or are there any other restrictions I need to know about?

That's really helpful! I hope there's at least a few spots in any core class.





Pretty empty until high school program starts

I've heard it is pretty busy in general but I went this Sunday afternoon and there were very less people

Very manageable. I go to Dodge everyday.

I'm gonna completely \*dodge\* your question, and just say this: Dodge Fitness Center reopened with Summer operating hours on Monday, May 23; see the [Hours of Operation page](https://perec.columbia.edu/hours-operation) for more information.



Edit: Im used to getting a LOT of work in high school (e.g. two lab reports of 12 pages, two exams, plus stuff for my other non science classes per week)

Don't worry about the workload. Learn how to study and seek help immediately when needed(and not waste time). Then you should be fine

Im planning on majoring in biochem. I took IB in high school, so I'm hoping that will prepare me at least somewhat for the workload. Thank you for the help!

biochem is possibly the heaviest major

Is it more problem sets and exams though? i’m very good at managing stuff like that i just dislike managing heavy amounts of written work.











It’s all pretty manageable tbh, just be sure to read the syllabus and don’t overload yourself.



**Edit:** Random aside, but you should totally take the Shakespeare course if they still offer it. You’ll get a chance to go to the “Rare Books” library and read Shakespeare from an original copy of the first folio and other priceless books.



Also, the beginning of the neurosci major is psychology, so it's pretty easy. The end of it is known to be extremely difficult as it gets pretty deep into the neurobio side of things. Bit of a rollercoaster of a major. Love it though.

as a premed stem student, I can say the workload is pretty real. I definitely spent almost all of my time on schoolwork.

The number of stuff you have to do doesn't really matter. What matters is how difficult it is. It's easy to have one problem set that takes more time than problem sets for three other classes combined.

I’m going to assume that you took rigorous courses in the IB and have gotten good predicted grades in these courses (enough to get into Columbia) and will get similarly good grades on your actual exams. 



You’ll be fine.



Edit: I would say that HL Chem is harder than gen chem just from what I’ve seen lol.

The workload at Fu, and other rigorous academic institutions is no longer just 'busy work'. Most STEM students organize their schedules carefully to balance the known intense courses with lighter ones. This also let's them compete for better marks in their classes.



At Columbia, some of the student body are literal geniuses, and the professors want to challenge those students along with all the rest of you. So, unfortunately, a lot of the homework is just plain hard. Also unfortunately, once you're an upperclassmen, you'll find a lot of this content is so high level, and possibly obscure, that it's difficult to find free* resources to help you complete the work. This is why many students rock a Chegg, probably a good investment.





In summary: balance known hard classes with lighter ones, know your professors, make some friends, get a Chegg. If necessary, learn when to cut your losses. Try and have fun! Lots of the course content is extremely interesting when it's not trying to kill you!

I know this is dumb since I should use orientation time to its fullest extent in meeting people and socializing; however, I never see this friend since we live like 5,000 miles away lol. Any advice would be appreciated!



Thanks

I even missed some of the mandatory ones for medical reasons. If it’s that important of an event there will be makeup sessions

There are a couple of mandatory events like the talks about the school and safety and whatnot. Typically the more social events in the evening are optional.

You can skip the events, go have fun!



Some people meet good friends during orientation







Just be sure to cherish the time you have and to have fun!!

I really encourage you to fill up every day and go to every orientation event. But if this really means a lot to you, my recommendation is this: invite your friend to campus, then they can go with your orientation group on one of the NYC outdoor experiences. No one can stop you, so just hang out while on orientation trips! If you’d really prefer being alone, then just dodge the event and go hang out. The schedule allows for plenty of time to do that.

Lifelong friends are made at orientation. Met one of my best friends that first week. Consider going to all the events.

regardless of what's the "right" choice, you can even skip the mandatory events and just say you weren't feeling great and there will be no consequences. they'll have makeup sessions

I didn't go to the mandatory events, and literally nothing happened, lol. I think it might preclude you from being an RA or an NSOP leader, but there are always make-up dates if that matters for you. Honestly, I wouldn't stress about it. See your friend! Missing one tiny part of orientation isn't a big deal, and it won't make-or-break your Columbia experience. I personally never even talked to anyone I met at NSOP ever again.

go to events- making them up becomes a pain once registration, classes start- CU classes don't start slowly.

Thank you!

I use the intercampus shuttle. It runs on a schedule they’ve posted on their website (plus you can download a wonky app that tracks the shuttles). It’s free and I prefer it to the subway. Shuttle takes about 20-25 mins, subway takes about 15 mins!

Thank you!

Also the 4 bus

Awesome thank you!

Does anyone know what GPA one should aim for if they wanted to earn cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude for a BA from the School of General Studies, respectively? I'll be graduating in 2025, but information from this year's class or prior classes would be much appreciated. Thank you!

Thank you for your response! And I agree, but for me, personally, I would like to do the best I can do considering how much money I'm spending on my education, so graduating with honors is a goal of mine. Equally, though, my health is more important, and I don't want to burn myself out too much.

Yes! You have your priorities straight. I don't think you will regret doing your best--what you might regret is, say, planning your schedule around easy As rather than classes that are actually meaningful to you, or burning yourself out (hardly guaranteed to result in fantastic grades, anyway--sometimes quite the opposite). I hope you have a rewarding time at Columbia!

That's good advice! Thank you!

Latin honors cutoffs vary--a certain percentage of the class receives these honors each year, and the higher the average GPA, the higher the cutoff.



Latin honors are also meaningless. They will make you feel a little warm glow for one day, but to build your life around earning them is simply not worth doing.

Just get straight A’s. 



Maybe sprinkle in a few A+. 



Are you planning on going to a highly selective grad school or PhD after? If not, the effort for A’s probably isn’t worth it and you’d be better off getting practical experience and networking in the time it would take to ace all your classes.

Summa was around 4.05 over the pandemic, I heard. Should lower by 2025 due to pandemic grade inflation

study spot on campus tmrw

Uris should be open

Says we should since normal Knowledge Center Hours are like from 8 am to 8 pm.  Columbia Shuttles are down today I guess @ Fort Lee so I can’t verify myself today…

I c thanks!

Health Sciences Library @ CUIMC on West 168 Street & Fort Washington Avenue—called the “Hammer Health Sciences Building” (cuz OP is 2 Legit 2 Quit?!  🤷‍♂️).  Verified by Columbia Libraries website.

How do you commute from downtown to Columbia?

Hi,





What would be the best and quickest way to commute to Columbia from downtown?

Yes saw that but isn’t 1 quite slow? Commute time could be 45 mins each way?

it can be. can also take the express up to 96 and then swap to 1. that should be quicker for that distance

Taking the 2/3 up to 96 will maybe save you 5 minutes max. I’d rather sit on the 1 and read a book.

it can be slow, but definitely not 45 mins each way. more like 20 on a regular day

As others have said, taking the 2/3 up to 96th St and switching to the 1 can save you a bit of time (though probably not more than 5m).

what’s your nearest subway line? assuming it’s penn station, get on the express and transfer to the 1 at 96

This is the fastest way to get up or down town. There would have to be major delays or it would have to be the middle of the night with no traffic for any above ground transportation to be as fast as the train. I too would suggest getting an express train through 96th but the others suggesting reasons for riding the local the whole way aren’t wrong either.

Yup. Plan accordingly.

More like 20 mins plus walking, could be more like 30 depending on delays or if it's just crowded. The 1 is local but it's otherwise quite fast. e-Bike could also be an option when the subway is having issues, would be about 35 minutes.

You will not find anything faster than the 1 unless you have a good mile time. If you don’t like a 45 minute commute, consider moving north and living closer to campus.

Maybe 5 minutes max. I’d rather stay on the 1 and read a book

That said, 34th St Penn station should be more like 30m, not 45m.

Yes nearest subway station is Penn

I'd rather take express, it's a lot more peaceful when there aren't stops every two minutes.

Take the A dude. Any mapping application would have told you that.

I take the 1 all the way up. Just use Google Maps.

I used to commute from 42nd and usually the 1 took around 15 minutes, so it shouldn’t be too bad. I lived by the Hudson greenway, so sometimes I’d bike. That took a little less time because my walk to Times Sq was 12-15 minutes.

random walk

Limousine is probably the quickest way (assuming private helicopter is out of your budget)

Post doc life



Check glass door for references of salaries. For government funded projects (eg NIH), often salaries for post docs are based in federal guidelines. You can Google these too - just note that these recommended salary brackets are scaled nation wide, so it’s not great money for NYC. A post doc might be able to negotiate for more $$ if the prof/lab has it, but it’s not guaranteed and based on how competitive you are as a candidate. Overall, in my field (psych) you don’t go into a post doc (or academia in general) for the money

In my group in physics, postdocs get 65-75k, depending on the grant they are on. There's not really room for negotiation, as the PIs have no control over this.



I'm sure you can join in on classes, but why would you need credit? You're a scientist, not a student.

Laptop reccs for CS major

Hey guys, was looking for a laptop to pick up before starting school this sept, and did some research for laptops good for CS and development. So far narrowed it down to framework laptop and MBA, what do u guys think? I heard MBA has compatability issues with Excel, but being Unix based would be rly good for learning. Would u guys still go with Mac? Also, do u think I should wait till the m2 MBA in June or something.



Thanks!

I don't think I've heard CS majors with Macs ever complain, but hopefully one of them comments. I use Excel on Mac and it works perfectly, no compatibility issues there. And yes, Apple may announce a new MBA next week at their conference, so I would wait for that at least. Make sure to use education pricing as well!

Mac as an excel app from the app store so I don't believe compatibility is an issue

You can't really go wrong with either. If you plan to use an iPad for readings and notes, iCloud makes it a lot easier to keep things in sync between devices.

I have an M1 MBA and it's been fine for the most part. There are a little bit of issues as you mentioned with Excel - main thing being Power Query, some of it just doesn't work as well as it does on Windows. But apart from that, MBA M1 is a fine machine. I've also been thinking of getting a Thinkpad and making a full time Ubuntu machine as well.

M1 Air is perfect laptop.



Totally depends on the industry you're interested in. Certain industries (finance, consulting) are notorious for early application timelines, as well as more intensive and specialized processes that you should have some familiarity with. Most other places you're going to be applying much closer to your actual graduation date and with more typical requirements.

So what about December graduates?

A few companies have programs that start in January. If not you can probably ask for an earlier start or recruit with companies that need an opening filled immediately

any American alumni here that pursued a masters degree / fellowship abroad? specifically in Europe? would appreciate any advice I can get! thanksss

From Sweden (KTH) also happy to answer any questions.
