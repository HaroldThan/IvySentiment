Class of 2026 RD Admissions Thread

Rejected ‘26 🥳

On what date did you get the letter that you were an admitted waitlist?

How long after did you wait before sending the LOCi?? In other words essentially when should you send it by before it's too late???

this is a while ago and i honestly don't fully remember. I think I sent it around early may? Could be wrong tho. Basically admission officers prob look at waitlists after the admits make their decision, which is during May

I submitted my financial aid documents on 3/30, a day before decisions were released. Now that I am admitted, how long will it take for my financial aid offer to be ready?

hi, i’m not trans myself but am v involved in the minority board at penn who represents non-cis students+women, if u wanna dm i can answer some questions and ask my trans friends some others :)

At Penn, you can major in CS from within CAS! The condition is that you have to have another major within CAS to be able to do this (as in, you can’t only major in CS unless you are in SEAS). But considering you want another humanities major anyway, I don’t think this would be an issue! I have a few friends doing this and it seems to work out well!

Also going to add that from what I've seen, so long as you take the required intro math/science courses that engineering freshmen take and maintain a decent GPA, it seems pretty straightforward to transfer to SEAS.

Update: Committed to Penn! Planning to do economics/cs from CAS. Going to try it out freshman year and then decide if I want to switch to SEAS.

Can I be rejected from being able to do this?  Is there a GPA requirement?

I looked it up and seems like you need a B in CIS 120 (intro CS class) and 3.0 GPA. But I think as long as you meet the requirements you can add it. Adding this major is not like transferring between schools (for transferring there’s an official application and its not guaranteed you get it).

Is CIS 120 a difficult class? I have prior programming experience and I took AP Comp Sci.

In general though, the difficulty of a major *mostly* depends on your aptitude to be studious, especially if you're in SEAS. That being said, the requirements for majoring in CS in CAS is generally easier, which is quite nice, but as u/musicTux said above, you do need to major in something else in CAS, which could be difficult.

I have a major dilemma. 

I was very fortunate to get into UPenn, Brown, and Cornell. For context, I have interests in both CS and humanities. I will probaly major in CS. One of my main priorities in college is to be heavily involved in research (both with professors and classmates). But here is the dilemma.

UPenn:

At Penn, CS is in the engineering school. I was denied from a Penn dual degree program where you could combine a CS major with a major from arts and sciences. However, I got into Penn arts and sciences (my second choice since I thought this would give me more options). Now, to major in CS, I would have to either do an uncoordinated double major which requires a petition/good GPA or transfer to the engineering school. This seems very difficult to do. Would it be a risky move to attend UPenn?

Cornell:

Brown:

Should I give up UPenn for Cornell/Brown because internal transfer or double majoring across schools is difficult?

Anyone else in the NETS program?

Ty! after i commented i looked at the penn finaid website and saw their meeting 100% demonstrated need policy 🤓 I guess i’ll just cross my fingers and hope their efc is similar to what my fafsa says

Go to Williams, leave UPenn for us waitlists :)))) >!/jk!<

Fresh off the waitlist! Debating between Williams and UPenn CAS rn :)

You were admitted to the entire school of engineering and you can choose any major you would like within that. You can declare a major at any point during your freshman year. It is also easy to change majors within engineering as a freshman

I will add that if you applied as an intended major (and not curriculum deferred) you come in declared as that major unless/until you change it. So yes, you're now in the major you applied for :)

I was admitted to SEAS for engineering, but in my admission letter it never said exactly what department I’m in. Is it assumed that I got into what I applied for, or is it like some colleges where you specify a type of engineering after freshmen year, or am I missing something?

[deleted]

plz help me decide between yale and upenn:

My major factors are social vibe (party scene) and general feel on campus. academically, i’m going to major in neuroscience on a pre-med track.

[deleted]

ah, CS is offered in the college as well! there’s no general engineering major in SEAS but if u wanna weigh options there’s a comment thread under this same thread where ppl who r more knowledgeable abt CS @ penn talk abt BA vs SEAS transfer for CS and double majoring, i’d check it out

2) Quality of class. Berkeley is definitely less selective (everyone in my school that applied got in this year while we had only 1 UPENN acceptance)

Penn Physics students: how is the major for an undergrad? Ofc the rankings say one thing and prestige is another but do you feel that you’re getting your worth? Asking because I need to decide between Penn and Berkeley.

yo guys! did anyone get off the 2026 waitlist?

I don’t have any volleyball experience, but I’d be down to learn/practice. I also used to go to the gym and loved it but ended up stopping and would love to go back to it and have a gym buddy.

asking for scholarship consideration

summer work study

this might be an absolutely dumb question but I’m new to work study  —

I’m doing a work study job. I’m supposed to receive pay every Friday based on my hours worked, so I was supposed or receive my wages this past Friday for the week of the 23rd. however, I didn’t receive anything in my bank account. 

do we not receive work study funds directly (i.e. do they actually go to penn and are subtracted from my fin aid?) otherwise, what should I do to ensure I receive the wages?

(im using direct deposit for reference)

yes! i was asked to fill out additional tax info on Friday so is my payment delayed because they’re still processing that? (although on workday it already shows what tax Amt was withheld)

yeah, I see the paystub. this is a really dumb question lol but do I need to do anything with that? my past jobs have always been direct deposit so I thought every Friday the money would just be deposited into my bank account automatically

ACCT 101 VS ACCT 102

102 is slightly more memorization and application of equations and formulas than 101 is (but you get a cheat sheet).

101 you learn basic accounting terms and how the 3 statements flow together. In 102, that knowledge is taken as a given and you learn more equation-related calculations for things like depreciation, COGS, and variances

What do Wharton undergrads think of Wharton MBA's?

Are you still in high school?

There were also mentorship programs set up by some of the Wharton clubs between Wharton undergrads and MBAs during school but didn't take part in them myself.

I was wondering if anyone could tell me the range of dues for professional frats.. I was hoping to joins PADS, but im not sure at all what the dues look like.

When I was in a frat, it was ~1200/year

Piggyback question: what about the non professional frats?

When I was in a frat, it was ~1200/year

What other classes can I add to my schedule?

Fall semester:

MATH 240

PHYS 151

I'm interested in the AI/ML track at Penn (prob like everyone else in the CIS dept lol)

I'm also interested in potentially pursuing a major in Wharton (if I can get it) or Econ/ Mathematical Econ in CAS and potentially a accelerated masters in CIS, so let me know what courses I should do.

Credits I have now from AP Credits:

EAS 091 (AP Chem), PHYS 150 (AP Phys C: mech), CIS 110 (AP CS A), ECON 001 (AP Macroecon), ECON 002 (AP Microecon), STAT 101 (AP Stats), PSYCH 001 (AP Psych)

you only get retroactive credit for 114 if you take 241

I think they removed that for class of 26

do not bank on testing out of 114 💀 

last year during the beginning of the year i only know of 1 person who did it because of how poorly made the 114 curriculum is

I placed out with both the Mechanics and E&M AP credits

2. If you wanna transfer to / dual Wharton you should probably try to take a wharton course sometime, just helps with apps and stuff (I'm also currently tryna transfer into M&T haha)

3. Take ECON 101!!! Although hard, this course counts as a credit for BEPP 250 if you get into wharton and also helps with the econ major. Definitely suggest taking it in the fall with vohra because the spring semester was not it :(

i submitted the day of on april 15th and i’m getting a bit anxious about how much i have to pay for the next school year… i haven’t received any emails and i tried checking pennintouch/path@penn but it’s not showing me anything either.

what do we need to submit — just fafsa, pfas, and CSS right? I haven’t gotten mine yet either and I was thinking maybe I forgot to submit something?

At Penn over the summer

Hello!! I got into one of Penn’s High School Summer Academies. I was wondering, what is the best way to get to Fagin Hall from 30th Street Station? I could walk but it’s a 25 minute walk and in the case I am running late or something I want to be able to have a faster way.

1.	37th station is closer to Fagin, but it puts you kinda smack dab in the middle of the Quad, so you have to walk around the quad (on either side) to get to Hamilton walk. Then, from there, walk to the Biomed library (Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine - Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion). Walk through the lobby to the other side and Fagin is right there

Omg thank you so much! Yeah, I have never been. I have done dual enrollment at Penn but I was at Hayden which is near so many buses.

If you're coming via SEPTA Regional Rail your better plan is to get off at Penn Med instead of 30th Street, if you're on a line that stops there. If you're arriving at 30th Street via the El, you could transfer to the 52 bus, but with waiting, you likely won't save any time.

No. What is that?

Not all trains go to Penn Med so it makes my life 10x more difficult 😩. I would have to get off then take the airport line to Penn Med.

Then just go to 30th and take the 30th street trolley to 36th

Do you think I could take the 21 to 36th and then walk?

Yeah you could get off Reguonal Rail at Penn med, or you could trolley from 30th to 36th, then cut through the bioengineering library

Omg thank you so much! Yeah, I have never been. I have done dual enrollment at Penn but I was at Hayden which is near so many buses.

MATH 241O Professor

Chai will probably throw some differential geometry in there for shits and gigs

you’re in for a treat

Ching Li Chai Chai is a goat LMAO

normally i would be fine giving you false information but since MATH 2410 is such a shitty course to begin with, don't make it 10x worse by taking it w/ Ching Li Chai - he is terrible.

Biggest complaints with SFCU that a big bank may be able to avoid are: 

1. Since the students run it, I've had a couple times I've had a hard time getting service. Ex: I needed a new debit card over the summer living in Mexico and I couldn't get it till I came back to Philly, but a bigger bank may be able to process that.

2. During the summer in Philly, I couldn't go in to get a cashier's check without making an appointment (again students run it) and it seemed they had some trouble getting someone to come in for the appointment (but I did get serviced).

Proud SFCU member here! Haven't had an account at PNC, but I'm mostly satisfied with what I've got from SFCU. The tradeoffs are what you'd expect for a local credit union compared to a national bank, PNC has more structured and wide-spread services while SFCU has more homey, local services. I couldn't give a list but an example of this trade off may be PNC has more branches in many places so you tend to be a lot closer to someone you can talk to face-to-face away from campus, but SFCU is local enough to be able to mail physical checks for you to pay bills as long as you schedule it in advance (my friends who bank with the big banks tell me they don't get this service). I'm not an expert but happy to answer any questions as an average member at SFCU

About $120

About $150 can last 2-3 weeks if you cook smart and cheap

How difficult is the Spanish credit exam? How do you study for it? I did pretty well on the placement exam, so I think I may be able to test out with enough work.

You better study it’s just like the s*t subject test for Spanish 😭 I failed and had to take span 140, which is a good and easy course that you gain a lot from so don’t stress too much

Chem minor

Does anyone know if I took organic chem 1 and 2 with lab (3 cu) and then another upper chem class (1 cu) would help to fulfill the chem minor upper division since it is already 4 cu in total. Or do I have to take another upper chem class (1cu) to fulfill the 4 classes requirement?

has anyone tried to register for a summer course and it says "Another registration is in progress for this ID and TERM, please try again later."?? not sure how to add a course from the cart to schedule otherwise. When I click submit schedule and then submit registration it does not work

\[Academic\] How does one's attachment to parents during childhood influence college student substance use behaviors? (18-24; current undergraduate in the US)

Hello everyone :) I am a researcher at Carlow University working on their master's thesis. This survey is specifically looking at the relationship between substance use and parental attachment. It should only take about 5 minutes to complete. If you could help me out, it would be much appreciated :)

Should I Apply to SEAS or Wharton

Thanks. I actually was not thinking about applying to something else just to transfer to Wharton later. I think I’m actually more interested in engineering rather than business.

Hard to say which is harder to get into, obv Wharton is more famous but my year SEAS actually had the lower acceptance rate (according to the Engineering Dean, anyway). The easier one to get into is whichever one your applicant profile best fits.

SEAS

You still have to pick which school you want to consider you if they reject you from the dual degree (or take the all-or-nothing and opt to just get rejected in that case, ig)

Apply to dual degree and decide later

Seas = lots of work

SEAS

a degree in SEAS is probably more useful for everything except a long term career in IB.... for example north of 70% of all partners in VC have an undergraduate hard science or engineering degree while only 25%-30% of all managing directors in IB have an undergraduate hard science or engineering degree (this is a stat straight out of a book we read for a Venture Capital class in Wharton)

I want to study for the placement exam near the beginning of the school year and was wondering if there was such a list of lecture videos.

I meant the exam during NSO not the diagnostic one on canvas

Look at nakia rimmer math videos he’s the best, I would also try and take him for math at Penn :)

Why would you study for the placement exam😭😭 the whole point is to be in a class ur level, to study a bunch of stuff ur gonna forget will only do you a disservice later on.. as someone who took 103 and 104 just do it based on ur knowledge .. also most of that exam wasn’t even 104 material

just received an update to my finaid saying i got a named scholarship in lieu of my penn grant its called the tisch college fund …. do i have to do anything about that???

It feels as if I've wasted my university experience

if it makes you feel any better i know more people who graduated penn feeling like u than the opposite

Hi i am doing a pre med post bac and just graduated Cornell. I am starting to look for apartments and roommates but have zero idea how one might do that and find someone that I know will be a good fit. I'm super social but very much work hard play hard. I'm 22 female who loves working out, going out, and exploring philly! I don't know anybody there and would really rather have a roommate that is kind of in the same boat as me than live alone. Will take any tips!

Questions about first semester math

Incoming freshman here. I was fortunate enough to go to an accelerated high school program, and I graduated with credit in multivariable calc and linear algebra. However, I took those classes a few semesters ago, and I'm worried that I might be a bit shaky on all of my math fundamentals.

I'm also a political science major, so a lot of math (outside of statistics) isn't really the primary focus of my field. With that in mind:

1. Should I try and review my old textbooks this summer so I can take a higher-level math course in the fall? Or would it be a better idea (especially for my GPA and stress level lolol) for me to just start off in an introductory calculus course?

2. What are the benefits of me starting off with an advanced math course for my first semester? Do I get credit for the courses that came before? Will it free up my schedule later on in my academic career? Does it open up any interesting opportunities?

I do not know much about your requirements for your major but I'm pretty sure you just need MATH 104 (or whatever they renamed it to). Statistics is probably your major focus, from my experience I hated the math course because of the stupid flipped and active learning. It wasn't until I took MATH 241 (now called MATH 2410) that I started to like it again.

I would say just focus on the math courses you need to take unless like taking math then take the course that you don't have credit for. If you want to take a higher math course, then double check, if you can get retroactive credit for another course if you pass (I know some courses don't offer that anymore). Other than that, you could also try to test out of them.

For the political science major, there are no math requirements. You have the option to take stat classes if you’re interested in that side of things, where you’ll learn how to code in R. However, I believe the intro calculus (formerly MATH 104) or multi-variable calculus (formerly MATH 114) count toward one of the general education requirements. That being said:

2. If you earn a high enough grade in MATH 114 (I don’t know it’s new name)—above a B+, I think (It’s on the math department’s website)—you can ask for retroactive credit for the prior class MATH 104. This would help if you, say, wanted to minor in economics as many poli sci majors do as both courses are required for upper level econ courses

Catching up with my high school friends after Year 1 and realizing I take a lot about Penn for granted. The feeling of being integrated into the city is honestly such a blessing for us. I’ve spent a day almost every week exploring art, food, gaming, sports in Philly while some of my friends in secluded college towns haven’t had much of a reason to ever leave campus.

This isn’t really an answer to your question, but you get to choose the course classification on the medical school application so if the class is clearly English based on the title you should be fine to classify it as that

You cannot change it but you are not likely to get pushback from a med school if you share it is cross listed on your secondaries.

Hi!!! I accepted my offer a couple weeks ago and have set up my penn key and email and all that but was looking for other people in the program to either live with or just meet and talk about the stuff we have to do before classes start! I really want to volunteer/ work at one of the hospitals too if anybody has any information on that topic! :)

The swipes give you access to the dining halls and meal exchange at Houston Market (which primarily uses Dining Dollars), but options are limited and you are probably NOT gonna use up all of it. I had a few friends in the first semester who got the more swipes version and ended up with like 200 swipes left. Not the best investment.

What is the difference between “using up all your dollars and have left over swipes” and “using up dollars quickly and have too many swipes.”

???

I phrased it poorly, it's more about the time it takes to use up the dollars and only be stuck with swipes. So if it's 3 weeks to the end of the semester and all your dollars are gone, I think that's a better scenario to be in than only halfway through the semester and having only swipes (of which you will never use up because the more swipes plan is really impractical, idk anyone who got it and used all their swipes).

I chose the one with more dining dollars and ended up wasting about 50+ swipes so... :3

I payed my summer tuition 12 hours after the deadline. Will I be charged for a late fee?

🤡 Title. Is SRFS very strict on the payment due date?

No I’ve paid late before and only got charged once when it was over a week or something late. I emailed and said I was confused by the system etc etc and asked them to waive it and they did lmao.

does anyone know where I can get affordable passport photos taken for myself and a few friends (they’re not penn students but I am if that matters)?

Can also do it at the Campus Copy Center on Walnut and 39th

I'm a rising sophomore at Penn, and my friend and I are planning on competing at ICPC next year. We also want to do some practice this summer. DM me if you're interested :0

Sorry if this has been answered. I see I have a Penn email, I tried using the same password as Pennkey but it is invalid. I tried to reset the password and I get a message that I do not have permission. Where or how did you get your email's password? 

Same as your PennKey. The difference is that the email address does not include your school (pennkey@upenn.edu).

Try using [pennkey]@upenn.edu (drop the school). If it still doesn't work contract your school IT dept.

Help finding housing as a grad student?

I applied to a place and got rejected with no explanation, and I’m worried I’m too late to find something before the fall starts. Does anyone have tips for how to find a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment in West Philly? I’ve been looking mostly at leasing companies but I’ve heard it’s better to go for places that aren’t owned by a company? I’ve never done this before and would welcome any advice!

Ooh okay, I hadn’t thought of that but it’s good to know having a real estate agent helps, I will look into it :)

Question about summer jobs

For this summer it might be a bit late to apply. CHAS has RA positions available for the summer but I believe most of them are for returning RAs, since you would not have done the training otherwise. There are also Summer Community Advisor positions for students that are in highschool summer programmes for example. Otherwise there are a lot of other positions too. At this point I'd just get in touch with them and ask if they have anything available.

Thank you so much for your advice. They are so helpful :) I tried to look up for these positions @penncareer, but I can’t find them. Is there a specific place we can find for summer jobs only?

Biophysics as a Second Major

Hey, for some brief context I'm a first-year currently planning to study biochemistry, deciding whether or not to pursue biophysics as a second major. I am currently pre-med (prospective MD-PhD) interested in drug discovery and protein design, but I feel that I lack the quantitative and computational skills necessary to succeed in this research area (or if I decide that pre-med is not for me). 

3) any computational background that the major provides

idk about Biophysics in specific but the Dept of Physics offers 3 "computational courses":  Intro to Data Analysis, Intro to Machine Learning and Math Methods (which is basically Graduate-level Applied Math)

Do you have a specific place/neighborhood in mind?

I want to take out a loan over the summer to help pay for housing, living, and other expenses while I do PURM in Philly

Does anyone know of any student loan lenders that will give loans to students who aren’t enrolled in classes but want to take out a loan over the summer while doing research. If not what are my options?

Acct 101(0)

Would it be wise to take this class in a semester where I'm taking two other fairly difficult classes already? How difficult and how much work would it be to do well in this class?

Didn’t think it was too bad, the class builds on itself so if you get the basics down early, the rest isn’t too difficult. The class has no hw so I usually studied a few days before each exam and was fine. All exams are also open-note which is probably how I was able to get away with this lol. I took it with cis160 and did p well

Either place - your choice. If you register to vote at school, you'll need to register or re-register with the state your school's in. If you decide to keep your home address as your voting address, you can head home to vote or vote by absentee ballot (info below on how to request & return one).

Then your state likely has a registration deadline of about 30 days. That means it has to be **in their hands** by 30 days before election day.

It's useful for your reference & knowing your polling place, but it is not *required* for voting. 

**Q: Can I get an absentee ballot?**

The list: New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Texas, Virginia, Washington, California, Colorado, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Jersey, Maryland, Indiana, and Rhode Island.

Housing Application Error [Incoming Freshmen]

Incoming Freshman here and the housing application is due tomorrow (March 31st) but every time I try to log in to MyHomeAtPenn I receive an error and some weird information.

I think the problem may be related to my Pennkey since I only got it two days ago, but regardless I’m a little concerned that I won’t be able to do the application before the deadline.  

If anyone know what this error code is or has any suggestions on who I should reach out to for help pls let me know. 

[This is what the error looks like]

SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG

An unknown error occurred.

Error ID: 15575762

I emailed the Housing Team and they responded saying that this happens when your Pennkey hasn’t had enough time to transfer into the system. Apparently, it takes some time to trickle into the system and there is nothing we can do about it in the meantime. You can still complete the form once everything syncs but you won’t have first priority.

did you end up getting through? i have the same issue and im t-5 hours lmao

What math class should I take next fall?

I'm an LPS post bacc student, meaning I've already graduated from an undergrad institution but will be taking a class or two at UPenn before grad school. The last math course I took in undergrad was Multivariable Calculus. What UPenn course would be a sensible follow up, specifically for someone who wants to pursue a grad degree in the quantitative social sciences? I've been mainly considering Linear Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations and Linear Algebra, but any other suggestions are also welcomed.

i’m a post-bacc student too so 👋.  

these proof based courses may not be helpful in quantitative social sciences — the more computational based courses might be more of a benefit for you, such as a course in applied stats or something. check the admissions requirements and engage from there, unless you really wanna take pure math courses for fun

MATH 3140 (advanced linear algebra). Have taken this, but really it is very challenging and may not be directly useful for social sciences studies... It is purely theoretical and proof-based, and is more designed for people pursuing a Master/PhD degree in math-related fields.

is it redundant to take both? is one a better class than the other?

(I took both of these at least two years ago and this is all from memory).

Question to all International Students

How do you get an SSN and what are some horror stories of yours regarding SSN, and cultural shock in USA. I have heard that there have been students that had started job and didn’t have a Social Security Number, and when it came to get the wage, they didn’t- story from another Ivy league institution. 

What about campus jobs? Do you need an SSN for that?

In that case you’ll have to get a job offer, and apply for an SSN cuz you’ll be eligible to apply for one. Alternatively, you could get a letter from USCIS that you’re unable to get an SSN which you would then hand over to your employer (aka Penn) and they would hire you without an SSN.

You get an SSN when you apply for work authorization in the US. Depending on your visa, you may or may not quality for work, work-study, OPT, CPT etc and so it completely depends on your situation. TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR AT ISSS FIRST. They should be your first point of contact at all times.

1- You apply for OPT through ISSS at Penn (usually Spring of Senior year)

2- You apply for an EAD card *AND* your SSN— if you don’t already have one—at the same time.

3-wait for your EAD card which gives you the right to work in the US in a field related to your major (e.g public policy if you’re, say, a poli sci major)

I believe there are other ways to get an SSN. But for the most part you get one when you get a job. I have a friend who did CPT so he got his SSN junior year over the summer. Not a labor expert so idk if what his company did was legal but my friend couldn’t get his pay til he got his SSN. So if you can, get it BEFORE your first day at the job.

In that case you’ll have to get a job offer, and apply for an SSN cuz you’ll be eligible to apply for one. Alternatively, you could get a letter from USCIS that you’re unable to get an SSN which you would then hand over to your employer (aka Penn) and they would hire you without an SSN.

Roommate for Next Year

 Hi everyone! I recently graduated from UVA and will be joining Penn's MSE in Data Science program in the Fall. I was wondering if anyone is looking for a roommate?

should i use econ waivers?

i took ap micro & macro in sophomore year of HS and got 5s so i could use an econ 0100 and 0200 waiver. (001&002)

i’m a prospective econ major in CAS (may change)— does anyone who had a similar path recommend that i take introductory econ courses again? or would i be fine using the waivers and taking a higher level course?

i’m concerned bc i took econ so long ago & wonder if i need to relearn. has anyone experienced this & what do u recommend? would studying over the summer even help? tysm

REALLY are they too difficult? is it better to waive them 😭

No do not take Econ 001 and 002 they are living hell </3

REALLY are they too difficult? is it better to waive them 😭

University Campus Associates (UCA) for off campus housing?

Try participating in an experiment in one of the psych labs, preferably in a long term study. I made $2k one summer as a participant in the computational memory lab.

Try to find a work study

As soon as possible honestly. Took me ~3 months to find my place and I only found a place that was available after my intended move in date. Summer/fall semester are high peak times

Typically 4-6 weeks in advance.

I’m seeing August rentals popping up a little bit more now (I’m also looking to move in August) and when I called a rental agency they said most August move-ins won’t be posted until about June 5th so keep checking.

I asked about on-campus grad housing at an admitted students webinar and was told that there \*wasn't\* on-campus housing at UPenn, was that correct? Something happen to Samsom Place? Does this just apply for international students like me?

GA ;)

Sansom Place has some pretty dreadful reviews if you look on Google. Cockroaches and bad value for money etc. Fellow international grad student here and I’d look elsewhere.

Our grad student housing is absolute garbage. Don't live there.

I have recently been admitted through the waitlist so I am a bit late to everything including the housing application. I have not received my financial aid package yet, however my parents make less than $100,000 so I am optimistic that i’ll get good aid. I was thinking about enrolling by May 31 which is the deadline to be considered in the first round of housing. I was thinking of doing this since I really wanted a suite, I don’t think I can do traditional dorms. Is this a good idea?

The enrollment deposit is $400, and you might get it waived depending on your financial situation. There’s no housing deposit as far as I know. It’s included in the total bill.

I’ll be in Philly this summer and was wondering how I might be able to get packages delivered to me. I’m worried that direct delivery to my sublet runs the risk of a package being stolen.

Idk about regular mail, but there’s an Amazon locker on campus in one of the buildings on locust walk (I’m blanking on the name but it’s the one with Starbucks)

Closed for renovations/maintenance for a week. I think it reopens on Monday or Tuesday.

Dean's list question?

Question: does getting dean's list mean you have a 3.7+ for each semester or having a 3.7 cum GPA for the academic year. For example, could someone get dean's list if they had a 4.0 fall semester and a 3.6 spring semester, but their academic year GPA comes out \~3.8ish. Thanks :)

victory brewhouse on Thursday has a great half off burger that changes every couple of weeks in terms of flavors. 

I feel like you can get takeout meals from most chinese restaurants for under $15 (like a fried rice or smth). But if you're looking to have a proper meal in like a dine-in restaurant, the only one that comes to my mind is ShiMiaoDao Yunnan Rice Noodle in chinatown (usually $15-20 plus tax and tips for me). I'm sure there's many other restaurants that fit what ur looking for so plz excuse my very limited knowledge on this :3.

You don’t even go here, stop arguing. And don’t you think “dated” is a bit of a stretch? Especially given that you were fucking three states away

Yes. When I was there we had a dozen student suicides in one academic year. Penn will chew you up and spit you out if you aren’t careful.

No

Combined GPA on Resume for Transfer Students

I don’t go to UPenn so the career office hasn’t responded to my email asking for template. My school’s career office gave an ambiguous answer regarding this topic. Anyone have any info from personal experience or from a UPenn career counselor?

Graduate certificate-animal behavior and welfare

My amazing wife has applied for UPenn's online masters program in animal welfare and behavior. She's a busy working professional at an animal shelter. She is a behaviorist and has a bachelor's degree in psychology.

So I don't have experience with this program or with Penn Vet's online offerings, but I'll bite since there are no other responses. I recently completed a certificate program through Penn LPS Online; it looks like the structure was pretty much the same as well as the cost (although I did it for free being a Penn staff member) – it was 4 courses over the span of an academic year, one synchronous session per week and a couple of hours worth of recorded videos, one homework/problem set due per week.

Thank you for taking the time to answer! I work in trades, so my understanding of the benefits of graduate education is somewhat lacking.

If she wants to pivot/switch/shift careers, she'll learn how to be a badass quicker.

Hell, there are MDs that learned that they hate the healthcare industry - so they quit being a doctor and find happiness touring with a band.

Unlike MD, JD, MBA, MPA, MPH, etc., there isn't a set (or obvious) career path. 

You might make more money or you might not make more money.

No degree guarantees a job.

There is a vast number of career trajectories/career goals represented in the current students.

The Cert and MSc program at PennVet has only been around for a few years, so there aren't many alumni.

A lot of veterinarians are enrolled in the master's degree so they can qualify for a diplomate / board exam in Animal Welfare.

The certificate is equivalent to the first year of the masters program (which is 2 to 2.5 ish years).

There's a good counterpoint from /u/dabelong in the thread I linked:

If you're open to having multiple cards open you can get even more cash back, just make sure to pay them on time / set up autopay. You'll also probably have to space things out since some banks deny if you've had too many recent inquiries, so prioritize applying for the category you spend the most on. Some recommendations if you go this route (these all have no annual fee):
