Student Jobs

Hey guys, I need a Lil help. I'm looking to make some money on the side, and I was wondering if anyone had any leads for any kind of jobs. I am looking for anything from tutoring, transcript services, being a receptionist, or anything else people have tried out. Ideally this would be online or on campus, but I am up for in person jobs too. Any leads would be appreciated. I am an international student

Charged for a class I switched out of

Help!! I was not aware that if you dropped and switched into a different class during summer registration that you would get charged. What do I do? I basically only attended one week of classes. Do you have any recommendations for how to petition that the registrar drop the charges for the dropped class? TYIA

1. How many classes do you typically take in a semester? 

2. Is it overzealous to take these classes together in a semester (2 classes + labs per a given semester): Chemistry I & Physics I, Chemistry II & Physics II, Biology I & OChem I, Biology II & OChem II? (Ignore BioChem, that’s going to be taken over a summer).**

4. How many ECs do you manage during the school year? 

6. Has anyone taken the French placement exam? Do you remember the format? Do you need to essentially be a native speaker to test out of the foreign language requirement, or is being around an Advanced level good enough?

7. Has anyone majored in Medical Humanities? How is the workload—esp. in something like Intro to ICLS? 

8. Do you regret doing premed at Columbia, or do you feel like it would be similarly difficult at any top school (e.g. other Ivies, NYU, MIT, Stanford, Duke, etc.)

Please forgive any typos and the length. Thanks!! :)

Tutoring?

I’m trying to make some extra money this summer and am considering ACT/middle school/high school tutoring. 

Summer Sublet

Hi, I'm a male university student completing an engineering internship in midtown Manhattan, who's looking for a bedroom for a short term **2.5-month lease**. What I'm looking for/my criteria:

1. Move in: **ASAP**, Move out: **August 13**

4. Must be within 20 minutes commute to Times Square (Brooklyn/Queens welcome)

what were the pbk and latin honors cutoffs for cc this year?

PBK is top 15% of class then selected by faculty so there’s no hard cutoff. 

Latin honors cutoffs gets asked about every year and usually there’s not a clear answer. I’m pretty sure the summa cutoff was below a 4.07 this year but other than that I’m not sure. What might actually work is if a bunch of people comment with their GPA and what honors they got.

~3.93 got cum laude, probably near the lower bound but not sure what it is

$65,000 for Spring and Fall semester tuition

$7,000 for Student life fee, health insurance, health fee and other admin fees

&#x200B;

I spend $3300/mo to live here (not including tuition).  This is all food, housing, shopping, entertainment, gym, etc.  I live a pretty normal life out of a 1br apartment.

Can anyone tell me about the studio apartments at 608 W 113th St?

I Just put down a deposit through campus housing for a studio apartment at this building.  There were no photos, floor plan, or option to see the unit before I move in. Also, I heard there are a lot of frats etc on this street. How is the noise level? Anything else I should know?

Double Majoring in STEM

Hello, I am new here. Currently I am double majoring in Maths and in Stats at CC. Just finished my 3rd year. I am done with the core, maths major reqs and most of my stats major reqs (1 required course and 1 elective left). My motivation for doing these two majors was to reach a high level of understanding in both, without missing out on key courses in either. I have had a lot of fun and am looking forward to my senior year.

Now that I am getting closer to reaching this goal I cannot help but question what else I will gain from double majoring. Will doing this combination of majors increase my chances of being accepted into a mathematics of finance or computational maths/financial engineering master’s?

I'm not sure double majoring has that much edge in terms of career prospect. But studying stat with math is a smart choice

Also, Master’s programs are practically scams. Join a PhD program instead and just withdraw after you get your Master’s (if that’s as far as you want to go), universities will literally pay you to do the exact same work you would be paying them for in a Master’s program.

Has anyone taken machine learning taught by Verma?

Is it a terrible idea to take it without knowing Artificial intelligence? I have math/stats background, but not so much on compsci aspect.

The AI course is more of an overview of AI and covers many topics. There’s a module or two on ML, though, but that’s not the focus of the class.

Machine learning at Columbia is very much an applied statistics course. So it won’t be simply running through tutorials of Python libraries.

Oops do you mean 18 out of 100?

I’ll be touring campus very soon, what things should I be on the look out for?

Im not looking for others to help me write my supps, im asking if someone has a favorite spot on campus or building or cafe or something

No it is not a tokamak, and it is not in use. Just don't jump over our wall, then we will question you and throw you out.

It isn't? What is it then? Haha fair enough, I meant that someone could just walk into APAM and stare at it through the window. I would not recommend anyone sneak in and tinker with it

*disclaimer that i know this is a relatively dumb question but i'm trying to get an idea if living around Columbia is a good/bad idea*

You could go to a new bar in Manhattan every day for a year and never visit the same bar twice.

When you live in a largely “pedestrian-mode” city like NYC, 10-20 minute commute times are the norm for simply walking around your neighborhood.

In some universities (Berkeley), there are classes that are taught entirely by graduate students and undergraduates with no professors. Is this the case for Columbia as well?

Imagine paying $10,000 to take a class taught by a 20-year-old.

Definitely no courses taught by *undergrad students* lol.

Other than uni writing, are there courses that are taught entirely by graduate students or undergrads?

My 3000 level history course in the spring was taught by a phd student. It is likely that phd students also teach other courses but it is not common.

No classes are taught by undergrads

I think discrete math was taught by a phd student at one point (not anymore though). I haven’t heard of undergrads teaching a course though.

I think University Writing is taught by a lot of grad students, but I dont know if this is the case for all the sections.

But for stat and math, all courses are taught by professors/lecturers

Yeah, i forgot about calculus. For cs, I know one course that has phd student involved as a dual instructor, but it's a survey type of course i assume

Upper level PhD students have taught cs theory and discrete math regularly before.

 Negative, at least not to my knowledge. All my professors were graduates (not students) and held Ph.Ds, albeit I do know of some TAs who were undergraduates.

Yeah I don't think there are classes exactly like what you describe. There are some classes based on the presentations of your classmates though, for example, like undergrad seminars in math, which you can kinda say are taught by classmates (probably fellow seniors), but there's still a professor involved in the class.

Depends on the department. Philosophy has some that are taught only by graduate students.

Calculus 1, Computer Science Theory, Contemporary Civilization, Art Hum, Music Hum, Lit Hum, The Social World, Elementary Spanish, Sociology of Education. These were courses taught entirely by grad students, with no other professors teaching.

How much on average does an undergrad take out in loans annually after aid?

A potential transfer GS student, wondering what my real costs would look like.

Veeeeeery dependent on your individual financial situation. Talk to the FA office.

I ended with 33k in loans.

Edit: sorry, read that as transferring from GS to the college, so may not exactly apply.

Graduate Housing Selection (Law School)

I just got admitted Columbia's Law School and just had my graduate housing selection yesterday. The only options available are rooms for Lenfest Hall with an average rent of $2500 a month, which exceeds the average rent on their promotional material, website, and grant aid information (Room and Board cost of $21,600 per school year). I haven't selected a room yet for this reason.

Is there anything I can do, such as request general graduate housing or ask if there is any availability  in other law school housing building? I applied about two weeks before the housing deadline, perhaps everything is taken?

&#x200B;

I tried a bunch of time, never worked! I need to get a referral for something in emergency, and the in-person appointment will take too long. Do you get covered by insurance if the referral is after your appointment with an in-network practitioner?

try going in person to a walk in or secure message your primary care   doctor at columbia to ask for the referral

Hi, I’m an incoming student to the MS in Mechanical Engineering degree and was wondering if our UNI gives us access to any student discounts in NYC

The deans list won’t be published until the end of the PDF uncover deadline, which is a few weeks into the Fall semester.

Where does it go then?

I feel like skieurope’s answer might be a bit confusing in how it’s worded but basically you do owe Columbia that $2400 one way or another. It is NOT for general living expenses or travel or whatever (I think that’s another line on ur fin aid statement, something like “outside expenses”? Idk the exact wording)

It's simply a line item on your FA package. Your bill will simply show how much Columbia wants from you this semester. They do not care how you juggle funds to pay the amount owed.

Specific questions on your situation should be directed to the FA office.

If you scream and complain hard enough they might waive it but chances are you'll pay it either directly or through work study.

You are not billed specifically for the student contribution

Did you know you can use your UNI to watch cable TV? I definitely didn’t

I know with the abundance of streaming services no one really watches cable anymore, but as a tennis fan, this discovery came as such a pleasant surprise. Semifinals for Roland Garros are on today, and I’m on campus with no TV. I’m so giddy right now. My cell cultures can wait.

Do you have to be physically on campus?

Ohhhhhh! Thank you for sharing! I’ll be taking advantage of this :)

I wonder if this works with the campus VPN

You're paying *way* too much.

Jesus Christ that’s insane.

I went through university housing and ended up with a 2 bed with 1 roommate for 1360. NYC is not very affordable without a roommate. If you have to have one it’s nice for it to be another Columbia student

I’m a undergrad so the school isn’t paying any portion of it.

Looking at the responses for this post, y’all paying ridiculous prices just to stay around campus, which IMO is definitely not worth it just to avoid a 10min bus ride. I rent a whole ass, completely renovated studio for $1600 in Harlem because people think it’s unsafe. Your guys’ loss. 🤷‍♀️

if you’re considering majoring in Human Rights then I recommend taking it since it gives good intro and is a required course for the major

but if you’re definitely not majoring in Human Rights then take the other class

Transfer engineering student help

Hi, I got my TCE but I am a bit aware. I will be transferring from my community college to SEAS, I took Calc 1-3 and differential equations, but I never took linear algebra.

My concern is would I still be allowed to pursue mechanical engineering if I didn’t take that class before? I emailed my adviser but he just told me to wait.

I was wondering if anyone has any insights into how to get research assistant positions specifically in the social sciences (econ/poli-sci etc.) My approach so far has been to cold email a bunch of profs, but that hasn't been particularly succesfull thus far.

&#x200B;

Attend every class, go to office hours, develop a relationship with the professor. Ask them questions about their research. Do this for a couple semesters to show interest. 

1. Contact a professor who knows you––you've taken a class with them, or whatever.

2. Every semester, the department posts a list of all available RA positions in the department's website––these postings are either made by grad students or by faculty members. 

Cold emailing could actually work if you’re able to signal in the email that it’s actually worthwhile to work with you. The econ dept also posts a bunch of RA jobs at the start of each semester.

Cold emails work if you email a lot. Otherwise, you just have to get to know professors by attending their classes and office hours.

How much does Columbia check pre-recs for Econ? (Non-major)

I’m a senior poli sci student interested in studying the global economy. Technically, Econ 101 is a requirement for the global economy in the spring, but I’ve learned about the intro Econ stuff at this point through my other classes. I still want to take Global Economy but Econ 101 is a pre-req

Anyone at Columbia going to MCR's Reunion concert in NYC.

Has anyone gotten a cp grade for fundies? I’m freaking out and don’t know what it means. Does anyone have a clue?

For the Fall of 2021, the mark of CP (Credit Pending) signifies that instruction and/or grading in a course have not been completed. The grade of CP is a temporary transcript notation and will be replaced by an evaluative letter grade once  instruction and grading are completed.  Satisfactory progress by the student is implied.

Future Veterinarian Student

Are there future veterininiars studying here? I know Columbia has no vet school, but I read they offered vet students an externship to gain experience. Is that still a thing? Would Columbia even accept a community college student who wants to major in biology there and then go to another university for vet school?

Are prerequisites strictly enforced during enrollment period at Columbia?

Hello, I am an incoming sophomore transfer to Columbia GS and I am going to declare cs as soon as possible. I want to take the CS4775 Causal Inference and CS 4731 Computer Vision class. Would it be possible for me to take these this fall?

Thank you so much for your help! Excuse me but do I have to wait until senior year to take CV?

Because of this system, it will be really hard to slip through the cracks and enroll in an upper level CS class for which you don’t have the prerequisites. You could *potentially* make your case as a transfer, if you have comparative prereqs already on your transcript, but you’d really have to sell yourself to both your academic advising dean *and* the professor of the class. 

Thank you for your reply! So I might have to wait until senior year and even then it's not guaranteed?

In this case would my transcript showing that I got As in Cal1,2, linear algebra, intro to programming (not from Columbia though...) be enough? When instructor decides who to take in, does he or she consider the prerequisites the students have taken?

Not suggesting you should do this but… I couldn’t get into a class which is a requirement for my major. So I bombed that professor and my department advisor with a endlessly lemmings train of emails. And eventually they were annoyed so much and added me into the class.

I really don't know how people here are supposed to do that track if they simply don't offer the necessary classes? It's weird

I'm not too sure how it'll work as a GS transfer, but I'm assuming you'll be grouped with other sophomores at registration so I wouldn't get your hopes up for getting into the classes (especially since registration has already happened for most students and I believe CV is popular enough that it is usually is filled with seniors, though someone can correct me on this cause I might be confusing it with another class).

Have a good condition TI calculator, nspire CX model with all the high level functions. Don’t need it anymore for my major so looking to get rid of it for a reasonable orice.

This is from safety to cost of living to social atmosphere, etc. What are your thoughts?

I was walking with a friend on Broadway, heading for Riverside, just before the stabbing happened. I feel like I've never been able to process how lucky our timing was because it just got chalked up to "one of those New York things."

someone said the 24/7ness, which honestly is the biggest difference, but i’ll go a step further and say the constantness. like there’s always things happening around you and time doesn’t stop for anything or anyone. take for example, the recent subway shooting or the very unfortunate senseless stabbing in December; if either of these events happened in your small rural town or where i’m from, time would essentially come to a standstill and it’d be all we talk about for at least some while but here everyone just keeps moving at that brisk NYC pace like nothings happened. everything and everyone is constantly moving and you quickly have to learn to move in unison or you get left far behind

Also, I just missed my train, the fan belt on my car just broke, it’s a few blocks away but too far for me to show you, and I need five bucks to get home. If you give me your address, I promise I’ll mail the money back.

Born and raised in San Jose, did my undergrad in rural Oregon. 

Also, *always* be aware of your surroundings. ALWAYS!!! Do not get into that subway car that only has one or two people in it (or that nobody is in) and absolutely try your hardest not walk around by yourself at night. Do not walk around with your wallet in hand or staring at your phone. The campus is generally safe, but that's probably because the students have street smarts. Keep your wits about you. This is not some small town where there is no crime. Also, do not smile at strangers and do not stare at the crazy-seeming, probably very mentally ill people (yes, sadly, there are many of those people.) You can smile at other Columbia students (duh), but random people on the street, NO! You will be asking for trouble. The best advice I can give you is put on your best "do not fuck with me" face. I do it. It seems to work. While I'm not trying to diminish peoples' stories of being assaulted on the subway because I'm sure it happens, I've never had that happen to me and I go on it pretty regularly. My general rule is that I *do not* take the subway late at night unless it's a pretty populated part of the line with other people around.

I made the mistake early on of holding the door for the person behind me at the Natural History Museum….I ended up holding the door for so many people I eventually had to just look at a random dude coming through and say “sorry partner” as I let the door go and walked away. But it’s always polite to give your subway seat up to a pregnant lady or someone who obviously needs it (not everyone does this, but many do).

The only strangers to talk to me are panhandlers, I just politely say “sorry, can’t help you today” and keep walking. Unless I’m drunk, and then I’m generous lol

You just look past people. If you're walking towards someone on the street, whichever side you look to will be the side they expect you to pass on. If you're on the subway, look at your phone or a book. You can glance at folks, but don't look them in the eye

**Do Not Make Eye Contact** 

In NYC it's an invitation for strangers to tell you what you're doing wrong with your life/sexually harass you/scream about the Illuminati/etc

I moved from a mountainous rural area on the coast with a population under 1,000 to NYC. In my home town, I had to drive an hour to get to a small city. Here's what I experienced:

I was walking with a friend on Broadway, heading for Riverside, just before the stabbing happened. I feel like I've never been able to process how lucky our timing was because it just got chalked up to "one of those New York things."

The only strangers to talk to me are panhandlers, I just politely say “sorry, can’t help you today” and keep walking. Unless I’m drunk, and then I’m generous lol

You just look past people. If you're walking towards someone on the street, whichever side you look to will be the side they expect you to pass on. If you're on the subway, look at your phone or a book. You can glance at folks, but don't look them in the eye

When do new incoming grad students pick classes?

I just got accepted to the engineering department for a masters, but I can’t find deadlines to select classes anywhere. Anyone know?

Your first challenge is to make it past the health holds.

Yeah I have my stuff in there’s just no spot saying selection time lol, thanks

Once you get access to SSOL, in the registration section it will say your class selection periods. But if I remember correctly you first need to have all of the holds (including medical holds crap) before you can enroll in classes.

August

Yeah I have my stuff in there’s just no spot saying selection time lol, thanks

How feasible would it be for me to complete an MS in Financial Engineering if I do an undergraduate in CS (from SEAS) through the Express program in just one semester (ie graduate in May with BS and then graduate in December with MS)? I am trying to optimize my cost so doing a master's in one semester would be much better than in one/two years.

I would say barely feasible. MSFE is a 36 point requirement, which is extremely tough to do in a year as masters courses tend to me more intensive than undergraduate. To even have a year, you would need to finish your CS degree a semester early which is doable with enough AP credits and no minor/fun classes etc. - ideally earlier even earlier so you can spread apart the MSFE classes.

Access to libraries at CUIMC?

University Writing as a Transfer

Does anyone have experience getting out of University Writing as a transfer? I just took a writing course this spring at my current school that seems to be laid out very similarly to Columbia’s version and I’d really rather not take it again. I’ve heard that a lot of people get out of it, but what’s the process like? Just submit some of my work and hope for the best? 

Later in the summer, you will submit 3 papers you wrote at your previous institution, hopefully ones that show you can use evidence to support a thesis. (You'll get detailed instructions on how and where to submit your work.) Most transfers end up being exempt from UWriting.

Premed experience at Columbia

Hey! Incoming freshman here, planning to major in biomedical engineering. I just have a few questions about being a premed at columbia <33

1. How accessible are premed-related opportunities as an undergrad? Is it easy getting clinical experience (shadowing, volunteering, scribing) through Columbia’s medschool? 

2. How is the premed outcome for SEAS students? Is it common for columbia grads to matriculate into top medschools? 

3. I received work-study as a part of my financial aid and im wondering if doing clinical research in a lab could be considered as work-study?   

4. Would it be easier to do premed in the college compared in seas? 

5. What are things that you wish you would’ve done as a premed student before? Any tips on surviving columbia with a good gpa?

&#x200B;

No data to back this up, but I would imagine it's harder for SEAS students because their GPAs are, on average, lower than the other schools. Of course this is due to their coursework, but medschools don't care.

&#x200B;

For the laboratory work-study, does that entail doing *actual* scientific research? Or is it just cleaning and assisting around in the laboratory?

Ohhh gotchu. Scut work = no publications?

I'd say it's no different. Most med schools take in difficulty of majors when looking at GPA (beyond hard cutoffs). I would say it's very common.

I wish I would've started premed earlier instead of waiting till the last second to switch from finance jobs (still in finance jobs but planning on a post-bac).

Tom's Restaurant on 114th is the exterior of the diner of many Seinfeld scenes

Hi everyone. I’ll be starting my studies at Columbia this Fall 2022. I really want to see my assigned apartment share. It is called Shelburne hall on 110 morningside Dr. I Couldn’t find pictures or reviews online (including the shaft and culpa). I was able to see only a picture of the main entrance from google maps. 

Columbia housing have viewing appointments but only in person! (too sad about that). Also my assigned roommates are keeping their info private on the housing portal, so I couldn’t reach out to them. 

I've known a few people in that track. They all use MacBook Pro's. Whether it's through bootcamp or something else, I don't know.

&#x200B;

uhhhhh so wtf is going on with this class? someone on ed with admin privileges deleted this whole thread so they're aware that people are asking but would rather delete the thread than just communicate with us.

It's one thing to miss grading deadlines but to not communicate with us at all seems deeply unprofessional. I totally get it that life happens I just feel that professors should at least make an attempt to communicate with their class as opposed to disappearing. Fundies has been such a shit show lmaooo

contact your dean and get others in the class to do the same

also for context, this person didn't come out of nowhere salty. someone 2 weeks ago asked for a status update on grades and no one from the teaching staff responded. strange times

Has anyone lived on the UES while at Columbia? What’s the commute like?

How long does it take to get to Columbia in the mornings? Also what’s the safety like for women travelling after maybe 8 pm on these modes of transport?

I don't think there is a more annoying commute than UES to UWS/Morningside. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

the subway alternative was taking the 1 to 96 and switching to the 2/3 and leaving the stop at 116th and walking 10 minutes or so to 3rd Ave.

tldr; it's annoying commute

Transferring from Cornell to SEAS

but I got in RD and decided to go to Cornell because I chickened out over the core.

And what GPA should I aim for since Cornell Engineering is notorious for its grade deflation

I transferred from UMD to CC. 

Can I finish computer science major requirements in 2 years?

I was recently admitted to Columbia as a junior transfer! I'm bringing 60 points with me from my previous institution, where I studied finance. Given that Columbia does not have an undergraduate business program, I won't be able to continue my study of finance. I am considering economics (44 points), computer science (40-47 points), and history (30 points) as alternatives. 

Regardless of the major I choose, I need to be able to graduate in two years and will be unable to take courses nexts summer. I was fortunate enough to effectively secure a dream full-time position which would begin in June of 2024. Because of the fact that I **really** want this job I would be hard-pressed to push graduation beyond this date, and therefore need to graduate within two years.

For those who have experience within these areas of study, is it at all possible to graduate within two years? For additional color, to complete the core, I'll need to take three semesters of language, one global core class, Literature, Art, Music, and UW (27 credits total).

if you've already got your "dream" job, i would look towards a major that will be easier to fulfill. even if technically possible (not sure it is, you'd have to plot out the four semesters), 2-3 CS classes *minimum*/semester is no joke.

once you start working your dream job, your undergrad major won't matter as much. if you care about enjoying some of the social aspects of your last two years of college, it may be worth it to look into getting a concentration. afaik, a concentration awards the exact same degree while taking some of the pressure off of completing every part of a major.

How many credits did you transfer in with?

If you're GS, you have to pick a major, you can't pick a concentration unfortunately.

Probably not.  I was a junior transfer and it turned my 4 year degree into a 5 year.

Damn, this is different from what I’ve heard. Is this per a specific college or general info? Online for GS I see it quoted at 40-47, dependent upon track selection and optional courses.

I just checked, my 60 credit total includes gen tech electives which GS may not need

1. Intro to CS 3 credits

2. Intro to Computing 3 (I don't know if this is seas only) 3 credits

3. Data Structures 3 credits 

4. Discrete Math 4 credits 

5. Advanced Programming 4 credits

6. Computational Linear Algebra  4 credits

7. Fundamentals of Computer Systems 3 credits

8. CS Theory 3 credits 

For a total of 24-27 credits. 

Unless those 60 transfer credits can help cover some of these requirements then I do not believe it is feasible to computer the major in 2 years

I'm not quite sure what the issue is here. You can absolutely finish ~ 40 Credit hours in 4 semesters if that's what you're doing.

Most 3-2 students spend only 2 years at Columbia and are expected to complete their Engineering degree in that time. This typically requires ~ 60 credits, 15 credits a semester. Some students even take on more responsibility, pushing for a masters, or minor.

International student, added Fieldwork E3990 to get my i-20 CPT for summer internship but my bill reflects the charge for the course. Is this normal that we have to pay Columbia to do an internship that has nothing to do with Columbia??

I’m undergrad, do you happen to know if it’s different for us??

including SPS technology fee and university support fee :( happened to a friend. this university is a scam

If you are in GS you have to pay it :(

Oh whew thank you :’)) when-ish will it be removed? Should I just leave it alone?

I don’t remember when exactly but it’s before the fall semester.

Go to office hours if you have trouble understanding something or are nervous about a paper or test. There’s no such thing as a stupid question and the office hours exist specifically to give students extra help.

By asking stupid questions

All good answers above! Wanted to also mention that starting early is very important so that you don’t fall behind all of your classes at the same time. Mark all your assignment deadlines and also the dates that you will start working on them. I set reminders to start studying for exams two weeks before the date, and for essays I would try to start brainstorming a month in advance. Point is you have anticipate where you might have problems and troubleshoot things early by getting help before it’s too late.

Cheating culture

However, you should know that many MANY students cheat. Cheat on homework, cheat on exams (eg TAs leaking exams), etc. Especially international students from a culture that almost encourages cheating.

How/When can undergrads apply for the under 150k income financial aid for the upcoming year?

Thank you!! What if I didn’t have a fin aid package until now but due to shift in family income and the new policy I qualify for it? Would I have to apply separately for fin aid?

I got my financial aid package for this coming year recently and based on household income/assets, I would qualify. Should I be reaching about this policy being applied or will it be done retroactively when I am billed?

Yeah, you need to reach out to Fin Aid quickly, the document filing was due at the beginning of May. If you're a US citizen/resident, you should still be fine, but if you're international you might be in a tough spot if you weren't admitted with aid. Also note that it's still going to take into consideration overall financial assets, so if you didn't qualify before and your asset situation hasn't changed much, it might not be the full tuition discount

hi guys, French student here, I’d like to know about the safety of Central Harlem ? Especially the corner of the 133rd W street and Adam Clayton Powell Blvd ?

To add to this - avoid parks after dark and as a general rule, be mindful of your surroundings. Both Columbia students who were stabbed/murdered where either in a park or close to an entrance at the time of their assault.

I grew up in the hood. I feel fine walking through Harlem, as long as you mind your business you’re fine. Don’t be stupid, don’t be out super late in the city at all. The Columbia students that got murdered and stabbed were in Morningside heights. 

The other commenters in here saying otherwise just feel like pearl-clutching to me if I’m honest.

I  agree and Harlem is much safer than what it was in the 70s, 80s. Racism and racial stereotypes definitely factor into how the public perceives "safety". Perhaps though some of the women in your building might have different perceptions of safety because of their gender, lived-experience? It can be scary to be alone in NYC, but especially as a young, single woman. I've experienced harassment solely because I'm a small woman; shitty people (regardless of race) perceive me as someone they can potentially exploit or take advantage of. And as a result, I'm hyper-vigilant with my surroundings because I've had to deal with aggressive panhandlers, aggressive cat-callers, being groped at a particular location in the past. Absolute worst circumstance, I had a guy follow me for a few blocks on 125th Street while trying to make my way to Metro North after dark. 

I am an Asian-American dude who lived on 131st and Lenox for a month or two back in the day when I had to stay in an Airbnb before getting Columbia housing, my neighbors in the two rooms next to me were a couple from Burkina Faso and some white girl. I thought it was pretty safe as a mid 20's dude, to be frank I always thought the Asian and White people I talked to who were scared of it were just uncomfortable with having so many black people around. But if I could I would live closer to 125th street which is super crowded and busy so it's a little safer as opposed to a little further up where it gets real quiet if you walk home late at night. But I'm sure further south is more expensive.

I’ve heard that before. Unfortunately the room is far in the north of the Adam Powell Blvd. I feel like it is not safe. I know racism and fear are a big issue in every country (I’m an Arab Muslim living in France ☠️☠️☠️), I just want to be safe from drugs and gunfire.

Seems like you’re the one who needs to understand and learn how to accurately assess what a map is trying to convey (and also realize a NYPD crime map will reflect the racism, profiling, and bias of their policing).

You need to watch fewer racist movies and read more.

Every major category of crime besides murder has ticked up sharply in NYC — rape is up 27% city-wide year-over-year. Separating by category and cherry-picking data isn’t helpful — it’s the overall crime rate in one neighborhood vs another that is the only actual useful metric for comparison.

I've heard we get to keep our Columbia email post graduation. Does this mean we get student discounts forever???

Email isn’t always enough to get a student discount but you can try I suppose

Because it’s a gmail it’s a permanent email even after graduation but tragically most things that offer student discounts only do so for a limited time :(

Can i survive computer science

So im an incoming freshman and i was wondering since I didn’t have maths in 11th & 12th grade im an international student so will I be able to cope up with uni CS major? Like I had stem subjects like physics chem and CS in hs so definitely not far off like a humanities bg but is it manageable? Like im definitely determined to work hard if I don’t understand some math electives but want your inputs on this🙏🏻

Not sure why people think integration is an “optional” subject in Calc lol.

Only 1 and 3 are grad requirements 🫤

It’s part of the problem with CompSci as a major and software engineering as a job field. People want to increase numbers so they water down requirements (ie quantity over quality).

CVN student here doing my masters. In my first year, I've felt that one major experience that I've lacked is the experience of being able to connect and network with other students, given the distance learning, as that experience has been minimal within my courses as well.

Georgia Tech CS vs Columbia GS CS (Sophomore transfer) (Is there any undergrad who works with professor Elias Bareinboim)

2. How is the computer science class size at Columbia? I have heard that the class size can be quite large even though Columbia is a private school. Do you have a hard time getting to know with professors due to the size of classes and long waiting for office hours?

Thank you for your reply! Are there classes that require interviews to get in??

3: I only know for CS, but yes, you can take graduate level CS courses as an undergrad.

I was more so referring to doing well in COMS 4731 or COMS 4732, the two Computer Vision courses that Carl teaches. If you do reasonably well (A- or above) and are active in his office hours that would put you in the best position to work with him (or TA for his courses if interested)

In your other courses they really only care about your grades in related courses. Every ML professor here that I’ve been interviewed by has asked about ML, AI, etc. while none have asked for my University Writing grade. I’m sure like an F in a humanities class would alarm them but anything in the passing range is fine. Alternatively, if you haven’t taken a class but have projects you’re equally fine. My first yr I asked to do research w/ a prof and obviously I hadn’t taken any classes yet, so they asked for my github repo to see related ML projects

I’m only guessing, but it’s probably that way at UCB because it’s a huge school, so a lot of students are vying for those positions. CS at Columbia is small enough to where you can do research with any professor, it’s just a matter of time and experience (some are open to first yrs while others prefer third/fourth yrs)

 undergraduate researchers for advising? I have heard in Berkeley (I've heard a lot about Berkeley cause my friends went there. I am from California), undergraduate research assistants rarely get to work with professors and instead they mostly work under graduate students and thus, when they need to ask for LORs, most of them just get generic LORs unless he or she is really exceptional. Is this the case in Columbia as well?

(I've seen in a previous comment about Professor Blei; I don't think he usually takes undergrads because most undergrads don't have the necessary background knowledge in ML theory and math to be able to work with him.   

2. The class sizes are pretty big compared to other majors. The classes that are core requirements (and thus are taken the most) range from 350\~400 students with 2 sections, meaning there are sometimes at most 700\~800 students taking the class in one semester.

I'm a new CS major and I have some little coding experience in Java. I took a Java course my sophomore year in high school--but it's been a while and I've forgotten it a bit after not using it for long. This Fall, I'm planning to take Intro to Java with Blaer while taking Data Structures--is this a feasible or wise choice? I'm planning to practice some Java coding during the summer just to get a bit ahead. But anyone have any advice for me to self-study Java and/or data structures? What were the most challenging parts of Data Structures for you? What was the course load and assignments like? Any online resources that were helpful for you in those classes?

Thank you for your response! If you'd be able to pm me the full list of topics for both courses, or even screenshots of the syllabi, that would be greatly appreciated! I'm just really anxious about the fall semester because the past two semesters I have only been taking at most 17 credits a semester and didn't get super good grades in some courses :(, so I want to make sure I get ahead credit-wise and also prepare myself to get better grades. I took intro to Python with Bauer but dropped it half way in the fall semester, so I didn't get to complete it which kinda puts me a little behind on the CS path. I've heard from some people that Data Structures is very difficult, so I guess that makes me even more anxious. I'm still deciding if I should just do Java and DS at the same time in the fall, or just do Java and an extra fun class in the fall and complete DS in the spring since you said that Blaer is redesigning the DS outline. Also since there's going to be a new professor for DS in the fall, idk if they will be very good or lenient compared to Blaer and I want to make sure the class structure is good and not too harsh.

Typically Professor Blaer is the one who teaches Data Structures (3134) but not this fall as there is a new hire from the department who is instructing it this upcoming semester.

There's a couple things to note about programming in school:

The only thing I can add is:

a.) Discrete Math (on par with the Rosen textbook) will really help you on DS algo theory and fundamental mathematical basis on why recursion actually works (not just some educated @sshole telling you to take a blind “leap of faith” when in reality trial and error in this respect would cause Karel the Robot to go kaput into an infinite loop!).

Thank you for your response! If you'd be able to pm me the full list of topics for both courses, or even screenshots of the syllabi, that would be greatly appreciated! I'm just really anxious about the fall semester because the past two semesters I have only been taking at most 17 credits a semester and didn't get super good grades in some courses :(, so I want to make sure I get ahead credit-wise and also prepare myself to get better grades. I took intro to Python with Bauer but dropped it half way in the fall semester, so I didn't get to complete it which kinda puts me a little behind on the CS path. I've heard from some people that Data Structures is very difficult, so I guess that makes me even more anxious. I'm still deciding if I should just do Java and DS at the same time in the fall, or just do Java and an extra fun class in the fall and complete DS in the spring since you said that Blaer is redesigning the DS outline. Also since there's going to be a new professor for DS in the fall, idk if they will be very good or lenient compared to Blaer and I want to make sure the class structure is good and not too harsh.

Calc-based Intro to Stats and Intermediate Microeconomics

P.S I do not know the my professors names yet.

I'm a recent transfer admit to Columbia and wanted to ask if there were any transfers on this sub who could answer a few questions regarding registration.

Generally, when would new transfer students register and would it be before or during freshman registration. Also, I've seen a lot of posts on this sub that mentioned the difficulty of getting into certain classes, but usually how difficult is it to get the classes you need (particularly Pre-Health)?

Typically in terms of the Core classes you need to take (i.e. the ones the everyone takes)

You should always except to get into those at some capacity, maybe not at your preferred time slot or what have you but they usually expand the class size and let you in if it's a hard requirement like they did for the physics requirement for first year seas students 

In terms of classes for your major, while you're undeclared you aren't given any preference but once you declare in the event you are placed on a waitlist that is instructor managed (which most tend to be) then you'll be of a higher priority than nonmajors on the waitlist. 

This may vary by department and the specific class so I would just email your advisor after memorial day weekend is over to try and get that sorted out. In terms of registration you can check to see when you can register on SSOL and click on reg apts

You are not allowed to use Barnard bio to fulfill Columbia College major requirements, so if you're majoring in bio or neuroscience and behavior, you will need to take Intro Bio at Columbia (likewise if you are a SEAS BME major). If you are doing a major that doesn't require biology, then you can take Barnard bio. I don't think it's common for either Columbia or Barnard bio to have waitlists.

Barnard science courses do not fulfill the Columbia science requirement, but I'm assuming as a pre-health student that you'll take enough science in the natural course of things that you will fulfill it without particularly trying to.

I looked at the LitHum classes and they seemed to have filled up already. I do know you can get an override but it has to be done during class shopping period

How busy is Dodge gym in the summer?

Much less than the school year.

STEM Student Workload

Im an incoming CC freshman, and I was just wondering what an average weekly workload for a STEM major is. How many problem sets, exams, labs, etc. do you guys get per week?

this year only a handful of ppl actually chose to do the biochem major—i think around 12. physical chemistry is usually the be all end all

Depends on which major.

I was CS and you can generally count on one homework assignment each week for each CS course. Some courses may have a project as well due at the end of the semester, but with “milestones” sprinkled in. And almost every class has at least one midterm exam (some have two) and a final.

Math courses usually adhere to the above as well, with problem sets due each week, although I never went beyond linear algebra and ODE, so later courses may be different.

I usually encountered a similar coursework outline for core courses and “electives”.

And btw, some courses will refer to regular hw as “labs” (eg Advanced Programming).

**Edit 2:** Since you’re an incoming freshman I’ll add the following advice: assume you’ll spend 10-20 hrs a week on each weekly assignment for each STEM course. You absolutely have to put effort into STEM assignments not only to complete them correctly, but to be prepared for the exams. Exams at Columbia were no joke for me, and all my STEM courses were graded on a curve. It does not feel good to go into an exam unprepared, and you’ll likely fucking bomb if you do.

what did you get your MS in?

EE, I’m two credits away from it. But Columbia won’t let you go without paying tuition. So say, you are getting your MS at Columbia and finish all credits during undergrad, you have to stay for another semester even if you have no class to take.

I tried but Columbia out-smarted me. My advisor told me someone a decade ago got away with grinding all the credits early, and the school wasn’t happy about it. So they added a hard rule to never give two degrees at once.

It depends on your goal. I did 21 credits every semester except freshmen year, because I wanted to finish the integrated MS during the four years so that I don’t need to pay extra tuition. It got really bad because staying in A range took so much effort that I almost had no personal life. It might be easier if your okay with getting A-s or lower but don’t expect much. If you are spending 9 hours per week per course and you have 7 of them, that means 63 hours of your free time is gone. And if you’re having lab work on top of that. You’ll end up living my life, which is boring as fk.

may i ask what major?

Neuroscience, but the premedical coursework takes up as much time as my actual major. Lol.

Nice! I was planning to double major with biochem and neuroscience since from what i’ve seen the courses overlap and i’m interested in both. I’m not gonna go premed though :)

I don't think courses can overlap for two majors, but I could be wrong. Definitely check with your advisor. :) Those are both awesome majors

So, if you're stuck on a problem, and the resources to help you literally don't exist online in an easily digestible format, then you have 3 options: use a teacher, use a friend, use the text. Each of which may or may not be helpful. Unfortunately, you may spend 6-7 hours on a single problem that you have no hope of solving. Doubly unfortunate, now you wasted time that you should have dedicated to other classes. So this will add up quickly.

Really Random Question

This is a weird question but I would appreciate any response. I'm an incoming freshman and orientation starts August 28th to Sept 5th. How rigid is the orientation schedule? For example, one of my friends (abroad) is visiting NYC coincidentally during orientation week (and will leave before orientation ends) and I was wondering if there would be a possibility to hang out with them during an orientation day in the city since we never get to see each other lol. From peoples' prior past experiences, would that be possible or is orientation jam packed full of activities and required programming that I wouldn't be able to escape for a day? I was looking at the schedule (more info will come out in July) but it seems like Columbia is planning to do immersion experience the Monday and Tuesday of Orientation week and most ideally, I would need to meet my friend on Tuesday... how flexible is the schedules of the immersion experiences? 

Some events are mandatory, but the vast majority are optional, I wouldn't miss the baseball game though (assuming they do it again)

Personally I didn't speak to anyone during my orientation

I met my friends just causally one day in the floor lounge and now we are inseparable 

Commuting to the medical campus from the main campus

Hi! I'll be working on the medical campus this summer but living right next to the main undergraduate campus. How do people normally commute to the medical campus? And how long does it usually take? Thank you in advance :))

I’m in the exact same situation. I live at 113th st but my lab is at the medical campus. I consulted with my CSA advisor and he suggested that I should take the Green line shuttle from 116th st to medical school.

If you don’t mind the extra money, the subway is no joke 10 minutes or less. 125th to med campus is 7 minutes for me.

Cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude GPA for GS?

I'm not certain if I want to go to grad school, but I know that if I go I would want to work for at least 1-2 years after I graduate undergrad. I'm considering law school. My major is history.

anyone knows?

BS—was just at Uris today.  According to Public Safety, general Access Control entrance privileges are null for Memorial Day weekend.  Even Butler was “red” for me…. Try your local Panera Bread with Unlimited Sip Club coffee/charged lemonade/fountain drinks for free…

Yeah thanks, but I don't think non cuimc students have access to that library outside of normal hours

Choosing Classes

Hi! Dumb question but when/how do incoming freshman sign up for classes?

Incoming first-years sign up during orientation. Columbia College students are pre-registered for Lit Hum and either UWriting or FroSci. (You will have a chance to switch your section if the time ends up not working well for you); SEAS students are pre-registered for either Art of Engineering or UWriting. (I don't know about GS, but I suspect they are not pre-registered for anything.) If you're in CC or SEAS, you will have opportunities to talk to your advisor about what to register for. If you are in SEAS or plan to major in a STEM subject in the College, you may be taking a chemistry placement exam to determine whether you should try one of the accelerated chem tracks; language placement exams are also offered during orientation.

I’m starting B-school at Columbia this fall and will be living in downtown (around the 34th street). 

I've taken the 1 from Penn many times and it's usually around 30 mins

Downtown where?

You can take the 2 or 3 express trains up to 96th and swap to the 1, that’s what I do when I go farther downtown. They usually arrive at the same time or almost the same time to where you can just walk across to switch trains.

Fellow 34th street commuter here. You have to time the 2 and 3 trains  just right when you connect to the 1 train at 96th. Nothing worse than missing the subway and just having to take the one local.

Taking the 2/3 to 96th then transfer to the 1. This is usually — but not always — quicker than just taking the 1 from 34th.

I am finishing up my work in a lab with a few post-docs, PhD students, and scientists. (For context, I just graduated from CC and I'm going to work in tech.) I don't really want to ask the post-docs how much they make, but could someone give me an idea of the general salary in a STEM group at Columbia? Is the amount set by the university, department, or is it up to the professor?

I'm curious because I am considering getting a PhD in the future and I'll probably do a post-doc, but it's hard to have an idea of income levels as a post-doc because having that convo can be uncomfortable (i.e. people are weird about money.) Also, are post-docs at Columbia allowed to take classes for credit? I know some institutions allow this, but others don't.

If you plan on taking Operating Systems I’d recommend getting the 512 GB SSD cause those snapshots can get pretty big. I also got 16 GB RAM tho I’m not sure if that was a big delta in performance

When to start applying for jobs

If I’m graduating next may, when is the right time to start applying for jobs?

July is when the recruiting cycle starts. If you’re recruiting for an entry level program in the private sector, most of the good ones are gone by December

Now

Anyone here plays some dota2?

I'm sick of playing alone.

I remember there was a Discord channel

Hi I'm from the UK and been to various institutions here, currently studying in London.  Do you have any specific questions?
