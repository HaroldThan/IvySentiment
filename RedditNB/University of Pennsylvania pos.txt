Hey y'all. International student from Lebanon here!! Got into CAS as a prospective neuroscience major! So excited to meet you guys

Do they say that, “ We have enjoyed getting to know you through this process” to all student or it’s saying, “you’ll receive our rejection letter on March 31, so make ur decisions in another college”

Admitted waitlist ‘24 here. I wrote a strong letter of continued interest (basically saying I would attend if accepted and updating penn with any new ECs). I also got another strong letter of rec tho it can be difficult to find someone willing to do this at this point.

I'm an admitted waitlist'23. write a strong LOCi that highlight how you have continued to spend time in activities you wrote about in your application or even new ones. Also highlight new things about penn that you like from additional research. Essentially, it should be a continuation of your original application.

Omg I don't think I'll have a problem getting 1 - or even 2 new LORs - bc I've recently had major EC achievements (representing my country in a student research competition for my intended major). I'll also be attending an information session on the 4th - hope I'm able to get in!

hi! im currently waitlisted and sent in my loci to the portal. I was wondering if you also emailed it to the admissions office.

I don't believe I did. Not necessary

thanks!

Students at Penn who got in off the waitlist - what do you think worked for you? Currently waitlisted at CAS

it’s a bit more backed up rn, but should be well before decision day!! i submitted mine late too and they took abt 2-3 weeks :)

Okay, I submitted mine a day before decision day, so I’m assuming it’ll take a week or two

For living situation, there's the option to select "gender inclusive" housing, which will get you placed with other(s) who selected that option, regardless of gender/AGAB. There are also plenty of singles available.



You can find a pretty comprehensive list of trans resources [here](https://lgbtc.vpul.upenn.edu/transresources/). I'd recommend checking out what Student Health Services can do for you re: medical transition, and reading through the coverage for trans health if you're planning on using the Penn health insurance.

That would be amazing, thank you sm!!

Are you trans yourself? If so, how easy was it to access hormones and any gender affirming surgeries once you were on UPenn’s campus? Is Penn itself a pretty good with changing names and using preferred names? Sorry for all the questions, I’m just really nervous about this whole process and don’t know if Penn will be the safest option

How is the trans community at UPenn? I’m a transman who’s recently began medically transitioning. I haven’t had top surgery yet, but plan to once I’m 18 (after first semester). What is the living situation like on campus? How’s the overall environment around trans folx? Any advice would really help, thank you so much.

Congrats on all the acceptances! I made a late transfer from CAS to SEAS. As long as your classes first year are compatible with an engineering curriculum and you get B or up in your core classes for your new program, you'll transfer just fine. I literally filled out what was Penn's equivalent of a Google form and got an email back that I made it a month later, so not a super involved process.



On a separate note, people talk a lot about different lvls of prestige within the ivies, but I wouldn't make it a factor in your choice between Cornell/Penn/Brown. I can't think of any opportunity (jobs, internships, conferences, etc) outside the school itself and the city it's in that youd have at Penn but not Cornell, so I say (as a very happy CS major at Penn) consider choosing more closely based on which school personally interests you more than prestige. Dm if you have any questions!

I am accepted to the class of 2026 at CAS, I am thinking about switching major to CS or CE at engineering school. can you kindly point me to the link where it shows the required classes that I need to take to be able to eligible for the transfer? thank you!!

All the info you need is here: https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/undergraduate-policies/transfer-in-to-penn-engineering/

Thank you so much! This is very helpful! Have a great day!

No, not necessarily. But that being said, similar to other majors, most classes and their difficulty matter more about workload than content, since usually there are enough resources (TA office hours, prof office hours, looking stuff up online) that can help people get through the course content, but the sheer workload can definitely be a challenge. This is something that can be seen in CIS160 and CIS121, where the content itself isn't necessarily that difficult (well, for first timers, it can be difficult, but for people who have been introduced to the concepts before, it isn't too bad), but the workload is high enough where people can end up having a very bad time with the class.





Also on a different note about CS, from my experience, CS at penn is quite theory focused, and I personally haven't had very much coding in classes that I actually enjoyed, but YMMV. I'm sure other people have different opinions here, but I feel confident in saying that majoring in CS will take a pretty significant amount of studying for the average student (and the higher you want your gpa to be, the more you would have to study).

just an FYI, if u do go the penn CS route in the college, try to have a solid idea of what ur non-CS major is gonna be or at least a solid ‘group’ of potentially interesting majors- college requirements can make it so that you have to plan ur majors pretty well but u def have wiggle room!! SEAS w/ a college minor in humanities or just a lot of humanities courses might be a bit easier imo but if u truly want a double major it’s doable!



  



  

  



  

  



  

  



  

Cornell permits students to major in CS from arts and sciences or engineering, which is exactly what I want. But should I give up UPenn for Cornell? People are telling me to 100% go to UPenn as they see it as more prestigious. Maybe this is biased information since I come from a NY school where lots of people go to Cornell.

  



  

  



  

Permits students to major in CS from arts and sciences or engineering. Super flexible cirriculum if I change my mind. Did not expect to get in here at all, so I am not familiar with the quality of the CS department compared to UPenn/Cornell. Also, the CS major here seems more collaborative/low stress than UPenn/Cornell.

Anyone get civic scholars? Does everyone get to apply to BFS in the college?



Hello! I just wanted to hop in and ask for some advice in choosing a school, as I’ve narrowed my choice down to these 5 schools. My parents are willing to cover the costs of any of the schools, but I’m thinking Duke is the obvious choice since the full ride makes it ~$100k cheaper than my next most expensive (M&T is actually my most expensive option and would cost me ~$180k more than Duke). My parents also said they’d be happy to give me some of the difference in cost for personal use, which I’d probably invest with.



For the intangibles, I really like the vibes of Stanford and Duke best, followed by Berkeley, followed by Princeton and Penn. The good weather and school spirit were definitely draws for me at the non ivies. I also don’t care too much about urban vs suburban, as it seems that all the schools have enough to do on campus anyways.



For my goals, I hope to enter the startup world after graduating, but I’ve gotten the sense that M&T and Princeton are more finance oriented (please correct me if I’m wrong). Berkeley MET is so new that it’s hard to tell how well it prepares students, whereas I know Stanford is amazing for startups especially with its location and entrepreneurial culture. Duke also seems to be really strong in entrepreneurship (I read that the founders of unicorn startups like Coinbase, Neuralink, Airtable, Plaid, Cameo, etc. were all in the same years at Duke), so should I just pull the trigger for Duke or am I missing something about Penn? My issue is that I really like the M&T program as it offers exactly what I want to study, but I don’t like Penn as a school nearly as much as I like Stanford/Duke (or even Berkeley). Thanks!

Yup

yeah

Congrats everyone!

Congrats!! You can still upload, I literally accepted my spot without having a financial aid package ready lol

Thank you! Also how generous is Penn’s financial aid?

It’s very generous IMO! If it’s not what you’re expecting, you can always appeal and have them look at it again, but I’ve fortunately never been in that position as they’ve put my package together very well!

I forgot to upload the financial aid documents that werent my FAFSA and CSS…. I just did but is it too late?? Admitted RD btw

Hi! I got waitlisted. Realistically, what are my chances? And does anyone who has gotten of the UPenn waiting list have any advice?

Hey everyone! I got accepted to CAS as an International student from India. Delighted to be a part of your beautiful community!

CAS as an international student from Canada!! Intending to major Econ and Polisci :-) SO excited

Are UPenn students actually depressed? Penn seems to be ranked as having one of the most depressed student bodies, and I’m wondering if this is based on the course loads or other factors. Thank you for any help:)

Hey Guys! I got waitlisted from UPenn and so I am completing my LOCI. Would be extremely grateful if ya'll can please suggest to me some individuals, firms or companies who might be able to help me out in editing my UPenn LOCI for free?

Hey Guys! I wanted your suggestions on this. Can you please suggest specific things that I should add about UPenn such as the environment, the people, my department (CAS) to my LOCI as I was waitlisted for 2026? All comments would be appreciated.  

got off the waitlist on friday :)!! so excited

Does anyone have any advice for getting off the waitlist for Wharton?

 Thank you so much!

Just looking at your past responses you seem to have a biased view **Against** PENN. Literally every comparison you've ever posted has been against UPENN ie: you said that (Brown > Penn, Berkeley > Penn, Yale > Penn, Northwestern > Penn, Cornell > Penn ... and a lot more). Perhaps you just had a bad experience, but stop trying to generalize it to everyone lolol. Like literally all your comment history is just telling people to not go to PENN in any scenario.

 

Anyone else Vagelos MLS?

what major in SEAS r u interested in? some majors may be offered in both the college and SEAS

Berkeley is not the way to go IMO:



1) Huge public school. You'll be going to class with 400+ kids have little time to work on projects with professors, and leave without any connections. It's like a dogfight to get out of there ready for your career





3) Cost: UPENN is much more generous with fin aid if you need it.



UPENN also preps you very well for a career!

At Penn this Summer but don't know what to do? Make plans and chat with other students here!

If you're staying on campus and don't have much to do or you want to hang out with people but don't know anyone else who might be free, use this thread to meet new folks and to try out new things!



Just some rules as a reminder: Be kind to one another, and don't put group chat links here (to avoid random people brigading the group chat). Feel free to DM each other if you don't feel comfortable leaving a comment here, but hopefully this thread is like a chill, on-going chat!

Also on campus over the summer! Pm me if you wanna play basketball, gym, skateboard, grab food or walk! Down for anything

That's fine haha I also just started volleyball, I'll dm u.

ok babe

Looking for a dynamic duo to chill and hang out with. I have some pretty ambitious gym goals so hopefully we can grind together >:) . I play basketball but I also really want to get good at volleyball, and if you play any sports I'm down to practice together as well. I enjoy a bunch of stuff but I'm not particularly good at anything lol, so if u have any fun activities or stuff to do I'm always down to try!

Any luck increasing cu?

Submitted a request to increase my cu in May as soon as grades came out so I had “proof” I guess of having good academics (have a 3.9 cumulative though). Still haven’t heard back about increasing my cu limit to 6. Has anyone who has submitted hear back yet?

Sounds great, thank you!

Sounds great, thank you!

is the health and societies major in the college considered to be STEM?

No, humanities







that might be the case. Afaik, work study funds should go directly to your bank account. Workday@penn should have a page for paystubs, see if there’s anything on there?

If you set up your bank info correctly it should go right in. Click “view” on the paystub and scroll to the bottom. There should be a bank account listed, make sure that there is one/it’s the one u want

i already took ACCT 101 and i want to take ACCT 102 during the summer. relative to ACCT 101, how hard is 102



Is it normal for undergrads and MBA's to network with each other after graduation? Do undergrads count MBA's as their alums and vice versa?

Naww

Yah sometimes I reach out to people with Wharton MBAs at my company and say we're both alums even if they went to a different school for undergrad. They've all been great about it.

Explosions or fireworks

Still shook from the mass shooting at south street last night. Anyone hearing the explosions/pops/fireworks around Penn right now? Just wanted to assure myself that they were pride fireworks and not anything else

i hear them def fireworks

yeah man the fireworks tonight fkn shook me every time

Neighbor on 40th and pine have been spamming fireworks for the past two weeks… like I literally keep seeing them out my window

professional frats

Here's what I have so far

CIS 120

CIS 160

WRIT 037



Second sem:

CIS 121









I'm prob gonna be able to test out of MATH 104 and 114 bc I did the equivalents of those courses at my school before coming to Penn

Oh I see. I have taken multivariable calc though so I thought I should be able to pass out given that I have prior experience with the material

If you feel confident enough you could start with 240 and get retroactive credit for 114 if you get a B or better in 240. 240 doesn't really need much knowledge from 114 and I overall found 240 to be much better structured and even easier (lol) than 114. Though yes even here you'd have to either place out of or get credit for 104 but I've heard many ppl do that

Oh the website says they offer retroactive credit for 104 but not 114

Just curious when did u take physics? Bc iirc it's required lol

Omg we have such similar interests / schedules! I'm a rising sophomore and here's some of my advice stuff for schedules:



I took CIS 120, CIS 160, ECON 002 (rip ap macro), WRIT 088, and MATH 114 first sem and CIS 121, ECON 101, STAT 430, MGMT 101, and ESE 150 in the spring.



1. MATH 240 is so much easier to place out of than MATH 114 so I highly recommend taking 114 in the fall, and then study for 240 during the winter. For reference you need an 80% or above to pass the placement and the highest score for the MATH114 final was like an 82% (the exams basically have the same questions with some numbers changed)

4. Also if you're pursing CIS I'd suggest taking CIS262 first year too (should be fine if you can do 120/160 first sem?) as that really lightens up your schedule



Anyways hopefully that was helpful and best of luck <3<3

financial aid

hey, has anyone received news about financial aid awards yet?





thanks in advance!

oh awesome, thanks for the info!

I also submitted that day. I believe we should have it by the end of this month. June 25 was the date last  year I think so should be similar this year

Those 3 and also submitting the actual documents (taxes, w2s, etc.) through the document submission portal

oh awesome, thanks for the info!

Biochem with Megan Ruth Elliot

Has anyone taken biochem with Megan Ruth Elliot? I’m struggling tremendously in her summer biochem course. I’m looking for any help, resources, or advice. Thanks!

Two options

2.	36th street station puts you further from Fagin, but you can walk straight down to Hamilton Walk (where you’d turn left and walk a really short bit until the RWJ Pavilion is on your left). Do the same and walk through to get to fagin





Not sure if you’ve been to Fagin yet, but just wanted to let you know about the shortcut through the lobby of the RWJ Pavilion because Google Maps (and other apps) will take you all the way around the block and its so not necessary haha

Trolley 11/13/34/36 to 37th is best. Busses 30/49/42 could work if you see one but septa busses are slow

Yeah I am taking regional rail but not all trains stop at penn Med

The Loop Through University City http://www4.septa.org/schedules/bus/pdf/LUCY.pdf

Lucy Gold has a stop right in front of the station that brings right you to the area around Fagin

Have you looked at the Lucy bus?

Imo You’d be better off walking than taking the bus sinc ebusses only run every 30 min— I’d say trolley bc they run like every 5 minutes and every trolley except the 10 can drop you off at 36th

Okay Perfect! Thank you so much!!

consider getting a kickscooter. i’m serious, they’re great

Does anyone know who the other professor is going to be for MATH 2410? Also how is Dr. Chai?

Carchidi is the other professor, in my opinion best professor I've had at Penn.

Chang Li Chai is…interesting

University of Pennsylvania Students Federal Credit Union

Does anyone have experience with the Students Federal Credit Union? How are services and fees there? Is it worth opening up an account there compared to a bank like Bank of America or PNC? What are the best banks in Penn's proximity?







All in all positive experience tho and even if service is harder to get, I conjecture that the service I got was higher quality since the workers are peers who likely care more about your well being and the credit union's image than the average teller does at a bigger bank.

Thank you for telling me the pros and cons! I plan to study abroad in the future, so I think the international convenience that a bank offers might be more important. But, I'm glad to hear that the experience is positive!

Thanks for the warning!

I love.SFCU. i had a PNC account which I closed because of awful PNC is. Get anything but PNC, personally SFCU works like a charm.

I used BoA and PNC. Liked BoA more. Fees are waived for a student account and their credit card is quite good. Also their online portal is great.



PNC's online portal is meh.

PNC's online portal sucks because it keeps giving bugs. Also PNC is pretty much limited to Pennsylvania and nowhere out of state. Meanwhile SFCU has a great online support system with a new ATM in Huntsman.

No reason not to get a real bank account. I have PNC and its pretty convenient (online portal works for me and that's what matters i guess), PNC atms are in every wawa and CVS, etc. I think the pro for BoA is that it is easier to get their card approved if you don't have credit history, I don't think PNC credit card options for students without credit history are good.

I was leaning towards 187 because comments in a previous post said its "more bang for your buck." and also more flexible.  I am worried about getting the nutrition and protein I need through the free meals that come with clubs/events/workshops/program communities/etc.  



Thoughts?

how do you make dal?

Wow that sounds like a great setup!  Thanks for the insight!!

I will hop in to say that even if you regret your dining plan choice, you can switch within the first week. 

That being said, go for the dining dollars. As someone who has done vegan on campus for the last two years, it’s good to know that I can supplement with Gourmet Grocer / Starbucks etc.  Campus isn’t super vegan friendly but dining dollars unlock a whole bunch of options (such as bagel sandwich @ Joes Cafe or zucchini bread @ Houston market)

Previous post on being vegan at Penn: https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/orfcuh/vegan_penn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf



But regardless of dietary preferences, always go maximum dining dollars, because you never run out of swipes. Specifically regarding vegan food, dining hall vegan food gets repetitive and is bland, but you can use dining dollars to buy vegan meals and snacks at gourmet grocer.

Think it’s less about what you eat and more about how you go about shopping - I eat lots of rice, fruit, chicken nuggets, hummus. Only thing I don’t eat much of is red meat (sooooo expensive). But I think it’s possible whatever your diet for sure

$50 per week; aldi is a fantastic cheaper option!

For me it comes to around 100 bucks usually and 150 during end of sem when I'm eating outside more often.

I am a high school junior wondering whether I should apply to SEAS or Wharton. Would appreciate any knowledge about a comparison of factors between the two, such as which is harder to get into, whether a degree in SEAS or Wharton is more useful, amount of coursework in each school, ease of internal transfer, etc.

Please don't apply to SEAS because you think you'll be able to transfer easily into Wharton. That's not the case and you might be stuck doing something you don't like.



My advice: apply to whichever you like the most and aligns more with your interests and future career goals.



Which degree is more "useful" depends heavily on your interests. What kinds of careers appeal to you? Which courses do you enjoy more?



I will say an engineering degree is arguably more versatile - either school can get you into finance or consulting if you play your cards right, but a Wharton degree alone won't get you a job designing aircraft, for instance.

Why do you think so, if you don’t mind sharing?

Do whatever you are more passionate about, period. Even if you get the most prestigious degree in economy/finances from Wharton, it won’t make you rich or happy if your real passion was engineering. Trust me, I have been down that road.

Wharton and seas cultures are very different

Wharton = much less work, more networking 

Probably about the same of getting in, maybe wharton is a little more competitive to get in. Cultures are very dependent on college house, but probably different between Wharton and seas too. 

I would guess transferring to wharton is harder, but cant confirm. Have a few friends from the college that transferred to seas, albeit they had very high gpas

It really really depends on what you wanna do. Basic info: wharton harder to get in compared to seas, coursework in wharton is lighter, transferring from wharton to seas is easy but seas to wharton is not, usefulness depends wholly on what you want to do



and if you plan to pursue a long term career in research or high tech entrepreneurship, then SEAS or something STEM in CAS is the best bet

Why do you think so, if you don’t mind sharing?

Wharton and seas cultures are very different

STAT 471 vs CIS 519/520

Planning on taking one of these for my data science minor. I understand that they both count towards the same requirement, but I was wondering if it would be too redundant to take both, as then I could count CIS 519/520 as an elective for my CIS minor. I feel like data mining and machine learning are not the same thing and would be interested in learning both, but if the course materials are very similar, then which one would be better to take?

520 is more rigorous than 519, which is more rigorous than 471. Recommend 519 or 520 if you want to learn more applicable approaches that can be applied in industry, versus 471, which can be followed along with the colabs/code blocks they provide.

named scholarship

No, it shouldn't make a difference for you. Named scholarships are just from big alumni donations, so they might invite you to an event with the donors but that's about it.

Practicing English

Hi , I'm on research scholar . International graduate, i wonder if there any activities to help International student improve their English.

I would say join a club. Audit a linguistics course. Or just go to events in the city . Welcome 🤗

Immersion. Talk to people. Go to restaurants and order food. Stuff like that.

It's Philly so take advantage of the city. Go to bars and coffeeshops, talk to your Uber drivers, make conversation with the food truck people, etc..... I grew up in America but before coming to Penn, I dealt with some stuttering issues. But interacting with the city more improved my speech tenfold.

I'm sorry for this post. I'm not trying to fish for sympathy, I  guess I just need to vent. I'm currently a rising senior, but I can't say I've spent my time at Penn adequately, especially in regards to what to do after graduation. I know my marks are good and I have had a couple leadership positions, but that's it. I haven't had an internship because there were never any opportunities in the area I was interested in, so I've been taking classes both this summer and last. I'm hoping to get into a good graduate school, but it feels like the clubs I've been a part of won't help show my strengths. I also don't feel as if I've built any strong connections with any professors. And some opportunities I was interested in I had only discovered once the deadline had passed. Now with senior year approaching, I don't know what to do to stand out. Just... yeah...

Just having that name on your degree is going to open a lot of doors for you.

Be easy on yourself. You’ve endured a pandemic and arguably the most turbulent four years of the last several decades. I’m an old head and I think it’s fairly common to feel pangs of regret when you’re about to graduate. I know I certainly did.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is right now

I just finished grad school and I’m weighing job options now but I had a similar experience to you. I never even applied for an internship my whole life became I wasn’t interested and I just took extra classes over the summer. By the sound of it, you aren’t just looking for some cookie cutter business or finance career, you’re looking for something unique and new. Don’t worry, once that job comes out, if you are prepared for it, you’ll have success. You don’t need an internship for those special kind of jobs. There are very few candidates for those unique jobs as I have found out and not many are the right fit. When people talk about needing internships it’s because they’re going for those super competitive roles that everyone wants. Best of luck to you and stay positive! Don’t give up no matter what!



PS - if you haven’t already, consider looking at startups. Since they are new companies, they often have unique roles to develop their new products.

You have not wasted your experience and you have a full 25% in front of you.  You are learning about yourself and exploring different things.  You are not like everyone else, you can't compare yourself to what others expect of you.  Perhaps you did not avail yourself of as many opportunities that you might have and this is not a great thing but it is all part of a learning experience.  You are way to hard on yourself.  Why not make next year the best of your 4?   Take classes you are interested in, prepare for your graduate school exams, take some profs out to lunch, interview a lot, go abroad between semesters, do a lot of networking..  Have a great Senior year and good luck.

if it makes you feel any better, many people here are getting a liberal art education

Thanks a lot!

I agree with this about MATH 241, and in fact it’s probably easier to get a good grade in the upper level classes. And it’s worth it with the retroactive credit available.

Given your background, you probably should be able to learn the 5 weeks of differential equations they teach in 240/2400. If you do, I would encourage you to start with 241/2410 because it is simply a much better class than 104, 114, or 240. (Don't take it with Ching Li Chai though)





1. The math department’s course difficulty seems to vary a lot by instructor, so I’m unsure if a lower level course would necessarily be easier in the end. You’ll likely be asked to take a math placement exam sometime this summer, which will let your advisor tell you your appropriate course level, so you could study for that if you would like, though it’s wholly unnecessary and won’t matter in the long run.



What kind of higher level math class did you have in mind? If you've already had multivarable and linear algebra, seems like not much else would be applicable to you. Maybe differential equations (240)?

Different strokes for different folks, but really missing Philly and being minutes away from anything rn!

My gf goes to Cornell and I don’t envy her whatsoever. Penn>Cornhole any day.

Tbh when im feeling down i go to the dog park right across the Schuylkill. Also am a fan of the mutter museum in CC

Love the Kimmel Center, Northern liberties has comedy clubs and theatres, lots of sports bars, coffee shops in the south, board gaming houses

this is the way + beer + friends + crisp autumn eve

When she's a Mutter museum fan 🚩🚩🚩

The staff there says it's a popular first date spot lol. I personally love it!

What are some of the best places in Philly you’ve been? Tryna explore more myself

Well said, couldn’t agree more!

How the hell do you have time to explore every day? Been dying to but I never had the time or energy.

I recently found out a class I took is cross listed as an English course. I need English as a pre-med requirement, and it would help immensely if I could just count a course I already took. Does anyone know if it’s possible to change a course name on a transcript if it’s the da me exact course as a cross listed one.

Do you know how :( my advisor said no but I feel like I’ve heard people say it’s possible

I think you can do this

Meal plans

Hi! I wanted to know which meal plan is the best according to your experiences. I am planning on choosing the one with more dining dollars but I also have this feeling that I will not have enough money at the end of the semester. Thanks!

More dining dollars



The more dining dollars plan, however, gives you more opportunity to go to places like Pret-A, Starbucks, Houston Market, and Gourmet Grocers (a mini-market). Granted, options aren't that much expanded, but the dollars provide better flexibility and give you room to manage your eating habits. You're likely to encounter a plethora amounts of free food events through clubs and events (especially if you know where to look), so you are probably not gonna worry about running out of swipes. Personally, I had like only 6 swipes left by the end of the semester, but that's because I eat pretty often and rely on McClelland. Some of my other friends had a decent 30-40 left.



Tl;dr: the one with more dining dollars gives you more flexibility and "more bang for your buck," but if we're being frank both plans suck.

It's better to at least use up all your dollars and have left over swipes than use up dollars quickly and have too many swipes.

So basically you should be fine

Ty!

No. Ive done my financial aid (except FAFSA) like a week before the semester started. You should be all good.

If they do charge a late fee u can just call them and they are really good about just waiving it

So basically you should be fine

Ty!

passport photos

Ty, do u happen to know how much it costs per person

My husband got his passport photos taken there  at $17 for 2 photos. Not sure what CVS charges, but just make sure the photo they take looks right.

I've had my passport photo taken at CVS. It's not great image quality but it's quick and relatively affordable.

Right at the Penn Card Center in the bookstore! I think they cost $7. Had mind done there last fall.

Does Penn have a competitive programming club/team?

For regular practice, and for joining competitions like ICPC, etc.?

I think in the past teams have formed temporarily if a small group of students are interested in competing in ICPC but I’m not aware of a formal club/team for it right now. If you’re interested you should start one!



If you want to find other people interested in CP and practicing, there’s also PClassic, a club where a group of students organize a high school programming contest every semester at Penn and write programming problems together for novice and advanced highschoolers. It’s a really fun and chill club where everyone is passionate about CP and can share ideas every week. Feel free to ask me questions about it; I was part of it for 3.5/4 years at Penn.

Where did the "courses that fulfill this sector/foundational approach" list go?

Do they usually take it down during the summer or is it just being updated? Is there a link to the past website? I'm trying to revise my tentative four year plan but its hard to do without that website.

If we’re thinking about the same thing, which I believe we are because I had the same though. I had that website bookmarked for me and when I tried to go into it, it was essentially taken down and rerouted me to another website

the feature is now on path at penn !

What is the difference between a shuttle and a bus?



https://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/transportation/about/penn-transit-information/navigating-penn-transit.html



I think Shuttles you request a pick up and drop off location, and Buses run on a fixed route

Generally the "shuttles" are either mini-buses or big vans. And the buses are full-on city buses.

I think it's the 'bu' in bus and 'huttle' in shuttle

Same way you would normally. Talk to your coworkers, crack jokes, enjoy the summer, go to the movies, dinner, anything really!!!!

Chill in the Goldman lobby..

First time attending UPENN this fall. Could i get suggestions of where the best rent/neighbourhood would be within a \~20-30min drive from campus? Looking for under $1000/month if possible.. Thanks for the help.

Driving to campus will be a nightmare. I agree with the other poster that you should consider taking the regional rail to campus. In addition to East Falls, I'll also throw out Manayunk and Conshohocken as areas worth considering.

I'm not sure what sure what type of housing for, but I'm a comparatively recent alumnus, and a homeowner in the West Philly area, and would be looking to fill a bedroom at the close of next month. I'm in the vicinity of 50th and Baltimore, and while there's decent parking should you want to navigate by vehicle, thing are also quite close to a trolley line that would deliver you directly onto campus, should you so prefer.



Let me know if the location/transit availability piques your interest. For the bedroom and a private bath, I'd certainly come in well within your price ceiling.



I live in East falls, it’s only a 20 minute train ride into the city and about a ten minute walk to campus. East falls has a lot of free street parking and the neighborhood is a lot cheaper than university city. I would recommend taking the train as parking at the school can be a bitch, and it’s more expensive than the train. You can find a few places in East falls for below $1,000 and it’s just a cool spot.

Thank you

Thank you. I realized I had to get to office 365 set up from GSE page.

Hi everyone! I’m an incoming grad student and I’ve been searching for housing for a couple months now but I’m still having a hard time finding a place that’s affordable, has okay amenities, is reasonable distance from campus, and is in a safe-ish area.



Thank you so much, I really appreciate it! Do you happen to know if Zillow and Hotpads are generally better websites than Apartments.com for finding apartments? Totally fine if not, just wanted to ask!

I'm not sure which is better. Zillow is nice for setting alerts and includes apartments beyond the large buildings. 



Philly has many rowhomes that have been broken up into apartments.

Welcome! The rental market is pretty tight in Philly right now. Check out websites like Zillow and Hotpads. You can set alerts from Zillow to your phone when a place comes up for rent that fits your criteria. Also, consider looking in other neighborhoods popular with grad students such as Fitler Square and Grad Hospital. A short bus ride will also get you from the other side of the city to campus so also consider neighborhoods like Washington Square West.

Hi! I’m hoping for a place that’s <$1550/month, hopefully in the 700+ sq.ft. range, and within 3.5 miles from the Penn campus. Washer/dryer in-unit and hardwood floors (or at least non-carpet because of asthma issues) would be a plus! Feel free to let me know if your place might be a good fit!

That sounds exactly like my place. I'll DM you with photos.

I have a one bedroom house that I'm renting near Clark Park. What are you looking for exactly?

Ooh okay, thank you for the tip, I wasn’t sure if people had made one for UPenn, but I’ll look into the facebook housing groups too!

There are definitely Penn-centered ones but I think they're mostly undergrad. All groups are worth looking into though bc there are some specific West Philly ones too. Again sorry I don't know specific links.

It’s all good, thank you for the suggestions and pointing me in a good direction!

Im not on them myself but apparently Facebook groups/marketplace are where it's at. Maybe some other people here can chime in on good ones but check for "Philly housing" etc etc on keywords

I contacted a real estate agent that's been super helpful!

Ahh, it’s nice to know I’m not alone in this! And congrats on being an incoming grad student! Thank you for the advice, and since a few people have seconded Zillow, I’m definitely going to be looking for places on there! Also potentially looking into a real estate agent :)

I am also an incoming graduate student (frantically searching for an August move in lol) and I have found that Zillow is good for alerts and getting an idea of different rental agencies in the area. Hotpads is a nice tool but I found Zillow more convenient, finding a real estate agent would probably work well too since they might have connections with smaller landlords. Worst case scenario is you go in person and look for “for rent” signs in the area, I’ve heard you can get some good deals as it is usually a small landlord who doesn’t know how (or want) to post their rental online. 





Hope this helps and good luck!

How to see syllabus for class on path.at.penn

sometimes you don't even get the syllabus on the first day of class, lol

One of my profs gave my class the syllabus over a month after classes started. The uncertainty certainly gives you a rush. \*-\*

they'll show up by where you can order textbooks or drop the class, most courses just don't have them uploaded yet

I'd recommend just emailing the prof if they're listed

Are there any places on campus where I could print out some posters, preferably for cheap or free?

There is a UPS right under Stouffer, next to the Wawa

Thanks for the info guys!

Not sure how pricing compares, but Campus Copy, Biomed Commons, and Van Pelt all have poster printing. There may also be UPS type stores somewhere.

I used to play in the high rises, but I don’t have access anymore. Any suggestions?

Not sure how access works but Platt should be available to all students.

Anyone should be able to tap in. That’s how it was during the school year at least.

Not sure if these buildings are open, but during the school year there are practice rooms in Fisher-Bennett and the Music Building (Lerner Center). You can schedule reservations for them online.

Looks like Platt and Lerner both have summer hours. Platt is easier to access, iirc the Lerner practice rooms require an access code so you definitely have to book them. The Platt rooms are open to use if there's no one scheduled, so it's easier to just drop by spontaneously.

25 bucks for a single WRDS query. Won't take 5 minutes.

I'll pay via paypal. I need a query from the 13f holding data. I'll send a screenshot of all the settings all you have to do is run it. Send me a message.

Is this legal?

As I said, most of them are filled at this point. Your best shot is just emailing CHAS and asking if they have anything last minute (this is is especially good because they also give housing) and see what they reply. I wouldn't keep my hopes up for this summer though.

Get it! Thanks♥️

Hi everyone. I would like to work over the summer on campus. What jobs can we apply? Do we have summer jobs like RA? Looking for advice, thanks!

overnight parking

would like to visit my friend over the summer, anyone know where i can park overnight for ~3 days? thanks in advance!

most places past 40th street you can just make sure to look at the street signs! it’s quite empty due to many students leaving. if you want more specifics i could maybe send you a map to help!

You'll probably be able to find free street parking pretty close by. Like the other comment says, make sure you read the signs. If you're parked on a timed street during the time posted on the sign you'll have to move your car to the other side of the street or to another block when your time is up.

What area does your friend live in? West of 40th is a reasonable starting point for free-ish street parking if they live towards the west half of campus, depending on how far you're interested in walking.

Check powelton area and pay attention to signs

hey all, just wondering 



\- for the program communities, is it possible to be accepted into one (say, one of them in the quad) and yet still receive a single? or will you automatically be matched with a roommate if you are accepted?

In my freshman year, I was in a residential program in the quad. A few other people and I had singles. As far as I know, it was random.



Can anyone comment on the biophysics major in regard to these three things? Thanks!



1) its classes and rigor



2) the kind of research it sets you up for



Any good studio 1/bd leads?

Incoming grad student, budget is max $1,200

Hotpads and Zillow. Select your area and price point and set Zillow alerts on your phone. Rental market is currently right so decent places have been going quickly.

Thanks for the heads up

Not chestnut hall

Thanks for this, I’ve heard some not so great things about Sansom so I’m a little hesitant.

If you're only around for 1-2 years masters it's good enough. If you're looking at a 5 year PhD, well it's also great to start in Sansom your first year then expand outwards when you know which areas you like. Some people prefer living in Center City and commuting via Septa twice a day. Some PhDs are mostly virtual and only commute in once a week. I preferred living right next to my lab since experiments would run all day, I don't have to be around but they do require frequent check-ins. To each their own tbh!

Check here, you have to sign in and the map/options off campus are pretty good: [https://offcampushousing.upenn.edu/](https://offcampushousing.upenn.edu/)



Also at that budget, on-campus housing is a pretty good option as well. Sansom has great location/proximity to classes and nice views from the top. There are communal kitchen options so even though it's not listed, you should still be able to get access to one. I enjoyed my time there but there isn't too much of a community aspect (unless you're an international student, they seem to have better cliques based on language spoken)

Ideally within a 20-25 min walk of campus in any direction.

You can talk to fin aid and see if they can help you out with that

All federal and most private student loans are only going to lend to you if you’re enrolled at least part time. You could explore personal loans, but the rates on those are not going to be nearly as friendly as the ones designed for students taking classes. They also don’t have the same kind of protections. Unless you have a way to pay those funds back very quickly, I’d be nervous about personal loan debt compounding and getting out of hand.

Thanks a lot for the insight!

Thanks a lot for the insight!

Does anyone have any tips for orgo 2 and how to prepare for it? What knowledge should I brush up on from orgo 1? Thanks!

For orgo 2, I highly recommend not straying behind. There is generally a lot more things (reactions, mechanisms, etc) covered, so it feels like the class moves faster than in orgo 1 (at least that was how I personally felt). Keep up with the course and you should be fine! As the professors always suggest, practice is pretty key in orgo in general. 



As for knowledge from orgo 1, the basics that you have established there still apply, such as arrow-pushing mechanisms and nucleophile/electrophile stuff. If you read the textbook closely, you should be fine as the later chapters tend to review useful material from previous chapters.

Penn! Register to Vote

Here's how to register to vote in Pennsylvania. These instructions work nationally so they can be shared with out of state friends or family and use non-partisan information.



Please share the info with anyone who might want to register, but hasn't had the chance, time, or info to do so yet.



**Basically: Find your state **[**here**](https://vote.gov/)** and use your state's online voter registration tool to register.** If your state is one of ten that does not currently allow online registration, this website will tell you and will tell you how to complete your registration - it's usually printing/filling out a form and mailing it in.



OR, you can [register to vote in person](https://www.usa.gov/election-office).



**FAQ:**



**Q: Am I already registered to vote? Am I eligible to vote? Do I need an ID to vote? When is my next election?**



Answers [here.](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/sviddomestic.htm)



**Q: If I'm 17, can I register to vote today?**



Yes, in a number of states! If you proceed through to your state's online voting portal, which can be found [here](https://vote.gov/), it'll tell you whether you're good to go.



**Q: I'll be moving to college soon. Where should I register to vote?**





**Q: What if I need to change my voter registration?**



Find your state [here](https://vote.gov/) and follow the instructions. If you have any further questions call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm).



**Q: Can I register to vote on election day?**



If your state is purple on [this map](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx), yes. So, your friend who forgot to register can still come with you and get it done.



**Q: What if my state doesn't have same-day registration?**





If you're not registering online, I'd walk it to their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them, or mail it if you're doing it very early so you can be sure it arrived.



But don't depend on the mail within ...6 weeks before an election. It's just too dicey.



**Q: Do I need to keep that voter registration card they'll mail me?**





**Q: Can I use a pen with pink/green/orange etc. ink on these forms/on my ballot?**



It's the kind of thing you don't think of, until you do. They only allow the most conservative of colors and inks, so keep it simple: blue or black ball point pen.



If you're entering most of the info on the computer and then printing it out, your printer's default black ink is also fine.





*Make sure you're registered to vote first.* Then, [this page](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/VoterInformation.htm) will tell you your state's requirements, and how to request an absentee ballot.



If you vote absentee, unless you're mailing it in *very early* (over six weeks before the election), drop it off at their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them so you can be sure it arrived.



You can do that any day before the election.



**Q: If I have a felony on my record, can I vote?**



Check [here](https://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote)! Often, yes.



**Q: I'm forgetful. Is there a way I can be sent reminders?**



Yes! [Here](https://iamavoter.com).



**Q: But, do the midterms matter in my state? My state's firmly Dem/Rep.**



They sure do. While your state may not be competitive in a presidential election, your *district* may be competitive for the House of Representatives and your Senator may be. Plus, governor, state reps, etc. 



There are purple spots in blue and red states - you may be in one, and your vote could swing a number of outcomes.



**Q: Where's competitive this year?**



There are particularly competitive races in more than half the states - either [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings), [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings), or [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings). 





If you live in any of these states, there's a lot of competition for your vote this year and it's a great chance to get your voice heard.



**Q: If my state isn't on the list, there's no point in voting, right?**



Incorrect! Local races are hugely important. Some examples: county prosecutors can, for instance, choose whether to prosecute non-violent drug crimes or sex work that is occurring without trafficking. 



They also recommend sentencing. Some are very strict, while some others choose to make those issues their lowest policy priority. 



State legislatures and governors decide, for instance, what happens with guns, lgbtq+ rights, and school funding in your state. 



State Attorneys General can defend state abortion laws or choose not to. 



Secretaries of State can help people register to vote or make it harder for them, within the already existing laws. 



--



**tl;dr - register to vote. for a lot of reasons. if you read the news, or reddit, i'm sure you can easily come up with some.**



if you have questions about registering in your particular state, comment and i'll do my best to help. i did election stuff as a job for a few years, and i know how complicated finding the information you need can be. that's why i'm making these guides now.

Let's go Republicans!!!!

Biochem/ organic chem

Orgo 1 definitely helps.. if you're taking CHEM251, I know we had to draw a few arrow-pushing mechanisms. Otherwise I wouldn't say you ~need~ it.



I think there’s a lot of scope for clinical behavioural scientists but would love to hear from yourselves who did the program what you thought , what you got out of the program (networking, knowledge), job opportunities etc.

How selective are program communities, specifically the First Year Exploration program in Lauder?

Do the majority of people get into their program communities? I feel like my essay response isn't as good as I’d want it to be because I didn’t really understand the prompt, but I just didn’t know how important having a stellar essay is. How much do people typically write in word count?

ahh my mom wont let me do it because it requires me to move in earlier

Seconded

So program communities are reasonably easy to get into now. Outside of the Lauder one, that one is hard.

People also joined later in the year, but I think a lot of those people moved houses.

Anyone down to play tennis today

Pls

Yes, indoor and outdoor ones

Penn has tennis courts? I'm decent at TABLE tennis but barely ever played tennis lol

Not sure if you're still looking for someone to play with, but you can always ask nicely over at r/Drexel to see if anyone there wants to play too! Just keep in mind they they still have classes/coop going on right now.

Yes, indoor and outdoor ones

XD. Also love the flair

It's where everyone thinks when I day I go to Penn in Philadelphia

Copa Trash Cans with friends are a better way to spend second year orientation than the official Penn orientation.

I missed the whole orientation and it didnt change anything

2nd year orientation isn’t abt penn, it’s abt the benders you have along the way !!!!!

Why are some program communities not listed as a choice?

A program community I was interested in "Food for Thought" isn't listed as an option on the housing application. I've noticed other "Student-Designed" communities also aren't listed. How can a student join these program communities?

If they aren't listed, presumably they aren't running this year.

Food for thought the collegium thing isn't a program community. There are two separate food for thoughts



https://lauder.house.upenn.edu/food-for-thought



https://www.collegiuminstitute.org/food-for-thought

I see, so it's possible to attend program community events without being a member?

Ahhh thank you for clarifying!! You’d think they’d name things differently lol

Food for thought (program community) is pretty new afaik (that may be why they aren't on the list), they probably just didn't do enough research when deciding the name.

Food for thought runs through the collegium institute as an informal dinner. I’ve participated in it for three years and have never done it as a program community!

That one in particular may be an upperclassmen pc though I’m not sure

BIOL 2801 for premed

Can the LPS biochem course (“Essentials of Biochemistry”) be used for the biochem med school prerequisite? Thanks!

Yes, if you can get a spot.

How are your stat skills? Quant social sciences tend to rely heavily on those.



check the admission requirements for your graduate programs and take the core math courses required for those. that is, unless you want to take math courses for fun!



there are basically two flavors of math courses (computational and theoretical). so far sounds like you taken purely computational classes, so if you wanna take a course like advanced linear algebra then heads up that’s a theoretical proofs course. 



advanced linear algebra is proof heavy so a course like intro to proofs via analysis or intro to proofs via abstract algebra (i don’t remember the exact course titles / numbers) would probably be a solid pre-req for that if you never written a proof before. 



in a theoretical linear algebra you wouldn’t be computing a lot of things but rather proving things. 



Probably MATH 2400 (very basic lin algebra and ODE) or 2410 (diff equations)



MATH 3120 (not sure, but should also be doable and useful)





If you have to choose one, I'd say linear algebra is an essential tool for all sciences. Maybe 3120?

cis 262 and cis 511



Pretty redundant to take both. My iteration of 511 covered a couple of topics that weren't mentioned in my iteration of 262 (e.g., the polynomial hierarchy, some randomized algorithms), but it doesn't seem like it's worth taking 262 to "prepare" for 511. If you're especially mathematically inclined or think the content sounds interesting (which seems to be the case) taking 511 sounds reasonable.

What UPenn-esque plushie should I get my best friend?

Hi all! Hope you don’t mind me asking a little question. My best friend is going to UPenn, and I’d like to get a gift for her to take. She got me a super clever stuffed animal that relates to my college’s mascot, so I’d like to do the same for her. The thing is, there aren’t any Quaker plushies out there. Are there any iconic UPenn inside jokes I could play off of, or should I go basic and get her a red and blue plushie? Thanks for your input!

There are rightfully no Quaker plushies because he looks [fucking terrifying](https://www.google.com/search?q=upenn+quaker+mascot&client=ms-android-sonymobile&prmd=imsvn&sxsrf=ALiCzsZu8ZUVNmDReZolzJl9LGqVkmiYTg:1653846297090&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQ_bPIoYX4AhWsQzABHT4nCskQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&biw=360&bih=512&dpr=3#imgrc=bERI0dM25JASMM)



Maybe go with a Ben Franklin plushie.  He founded Penn.  Bonus points if you can get a bench for him to be pissing on

Plush Quaker Oats

Damn the way you phased that last part really added to the insult

It's honestly ridiculous. The split P is officially, exclusively for Penn Athletics. A year or two ago they decided to crack down on that and went after all the clubs that used it in their club logos.



Because *Penn Athletics* has such a strong and recognizable brand...



Plus if your club wants funding for any kind of merch with the text logo or shield, it has to go through official channels for approval. Not everything makes it through, and idk if they even tell you why.

They even went after the engineering school for it. Like 4 years back they had Penn Engineering hats that used the split P, and Athletics stopped them so they had to switch to the shield.

Really,  if it isn't apparel or barware,  good luck.

Good luck. You'll have a better chance finding something fun with the Penn Athletics logo on it because it's more readily licensed, but the people responsible for the shield and the Penn mark are...conservative.

u could probably find a stuffed bear in a penn shirt

Like most people have said, there’s not that many options that we’ve seen. However I did receive a small stuffed duck stuffed animal keychain before I went to Penn—the duck is wearing a Penn shirt so it’s pretty cute!

It's honestly ridiculous. The split P is officially, exclusively for Penn Athletics. A year or two ago they decided to crack down on that and went after all the clubs that used it in their club logos.



Because *Penn Athletics* has such a strong and recognizable brand...



Plus if your club wants funding for any kind of merch with the text logo or shield, it has to go through official channels for approval. Not everything makes it through, and idk if they even tell you why.

They even went after the engineering school for it. Like 4 years back they had Penn Engineering hats that used the split P, and Athletics stopped them so they had to switch to the shield.

Really,  if it isn't apparel or barware,  good luck.

Damn the way you phased that last part really added to the insult

Also I would be rrally grateful if you gave some advice on what we should be cautious when coming to Penn and USA. Thank you all very much in Advance.

Yes, I’m pretty sure you need one/will be eligible for one if you get the job. Again talk to an advisor.





I haven’t done that so this is based on things I’ve read ages ago. Double check with ISSS, you not only can just walk in but you also have a DEDICATED advisor that helps you in these situations.



I don’t want to be rude but Reddit shouldn’t be your first point of contact for stuff like this.

Thank youu very much!! You are right, but I just kinda wanted to know something before heading to my advisors, so that I am not totally clueless about things



But for both CPT and OPT it’s pretty straightforward. I can speak for the latter:



If approved:







4- Wait for your SSN which is usually sent around the same time maybe a few days after you get your EAD.



5- hopefully during all of this you were applying for jobs because you now have the right to work anywhere in the US! Enjoy! The limit is 1 year for non-STEM and I think 2 years for STEM majors.



—





Basically, if you follow policy and the recommendations the ISSS gives you’ll avoid any of the horror stories. The only thing that might happen is waiting a long time for your EAD or SSN which can happen. So apply the first day you can for OPT or CPT whichever one you want.



I got mine in 2 months.

Not looking for a roommate, but as a fellow UVA ugrad --> UPenn grad student I just wanted to say hi and welcome!

hello! feel free to stop by and visit us here at The Radian. We have both undergrad and graduate students and we are located right across from campus!

Thank you!!!

hello, i’m class of 2026 and have a question about using waivers for econ:







I liked 001. 002 was just taught bad. 101 is the one that's actually fucking hard.

sorry what’s 0xxx? is that like in between 001/002 & advanced? thank you!!

the intro courses that arent 001 or 002 so like the ones people who aren't in the econ major take like econ 0120, 0390, etc. they usually have similar names to an advanced course but are meant for ppl filling gen eds or the econ policy minor

super helpful, thanks!!

i waived econ 002 and took a 0xxx-level ECON course prior to declaring the major and if u have 2 waivers, u can do one 0xxx-level Econ course and 1 advanced level one or 2 advanced level ones. tbh u don't need the intro series for the intermediate courses but i thought econ-001 was a good intro into econ and if ur gonna take econ 001 or econ 002, econ 001 is easier.

appreciate it!! thank you so much

I was in your shoes a year ago and chose to use my waivers and start with econ 101 in the spring (took 114 in the fall). I’d recommend you and others do the same. Granted, 101 with mailath was actual hell on earth and the most humbling class I’ve ever taken. But I really don’t think I would’ve gained anything from retaking macro and micro. As long as you 1. are comfortable with optimization / math and numbers in general and 2. have a basic grasp of concepts like consumer surplus, utility, and profit maximizing behavior, you’ll be fine.

Any Facebook groups to buy/sell furniture?

I'm an incoming grad student, and I'm looking for a group where I can find used furniture, preferably in University City.

There is a Philadelphia Marketplace on FB but I would also recommend joining BuyNothing group. It’s an app now but you can ask for what you need, give away what you don’t. It’s free stuff!

There is a free and for sale fb group at Penn

r/phillylist

I am also a recent penn grad selling a lot of furniture (pull out couch, small dining table etc.) if you’d like to dm me!

Anyone has any experience with these guys for off-campus housing? Thinking of leasing from them or Campus Apartments, LLC (which I think are very closely related?). Would love to hear your stories.

Good experience. They are closely related to CA.

UCA is managed by Campus Apartments, not sure whether that means CA owns UCA outright or they have the same parent company or something.

Good side-gigs near campus?

I'm currently doing a summer internship on campus, but the pay is sub-optimal. Does anyone have suggestions of little things I can do on the side, either in Philly or online, to make extra money this summer? Thanks!

What is sub-optimal pay? Just curious.

Online SAT/ACT tutoring is a pretty good bet

What are some good ways for transfers to integrate into CAS?



I believe Transfer Student Organization will contact you shortly

Also have this question!

When is the best time to look for apartments with an 8/1 move-in date?

im looking for a west philly 1br apt near clark park or chestnut/walnut/market st but its too early. When do 8/1 rentals typically open up?

I have been looking and all my favorites are taken within a day. its so exhausting doing an hour commute (even with applying right as its listed) to tour and then later that day or next day being told it went to someone else. Im checking every day and nothing good gets posted. Ughhhhh sorry just had to vent

You’re fine! I literally started looking in March and just found a place like two weeks ago. I heard that people are apparently signing leases and putting down deposits without even physically seeing a place. It’s that bad. You can try Facebook groups for people looking for roommates. A lot of people are looking to replace their roommates that graduated!



edit: to answer your last question, I saw a lot of places that were open for September awhile ago. I think there’s no set time it’s just whenever a landlord or leasing company feels like it lol. Again, I’d start looking now. Also noticed you are looking for a 1bd. I’d still try fb since people are looking to sublease as they graduated. you can sometimes find a place where you can renew the lease after the sublease.

Try calling one of the big landlords like Campus Apartments with a list of your requirements and ask what units they have. Did that once and they were able to show me multiple places in the same day.

Look for apartments for (amount of days until you move in)/e days as benchmark period. After that, take the next apartment that's better than all the ones you've seen in the benchmark period.



Hope this helps and good luck!

That doesnt sound familiar to me, are u talking about philly ?

Apparently not, I wonder how they got here lol

Yes, that's what I meant. Thank you!



I want a close-knit community, but one that is not so frat/party-centered if that makes sense. I also want an all-freshman house. I am double majoring in Econ/CS if that matters. 



I am deciding between Hill and KCEH (maybe a house in quad if someone makes a compelling case for it). Which one should I choose?

Makes sense, thanks. I will rank Hill first then. Still don’t know if I should rank KCEH or some quad house second. Others say that KCEH can be isolating. I will make sure to sign up for a pre-orientation program.

KCECH can be isolating if you're not in Huntsman. The only "close-knit community" created by a dorm that I've witnessed myself is the Huntsman kids

What did u choose?

Lauder. It was very modern and clean but the social scene lacked

What r the downsides to quad/KCEH?

Hill. My biggest regret of freshman year was not choosing hill

Hill

Quad is very social, but not clean.

Kcech is similar to the quad, but not as social. 

Hill gives you the social part you’re looking for and is more clean than quad and kcheh

Was told that there's no on-campus housing for (international?) grad students.. is this right?

They've stopped designating them as GAs now. But effectively the same thing.

Even if there isn't, maybe you could be an RA? I know some of our RAs were grad students back in the day

They’re renovating Sansom East

Yeah, but I'm not sure it's [Penn doing the renovation](https://www.multihousingnews.com/greystar-to-redevelop-588-bed-philadelphia-student-community/).

I heard that Sansom East was sold and Sansom West is being used as office space / COVID housing.

Oh phew thanks! I did my application maybe like a month ago and still waiting for a response. Did you get your first preference?

Yes I did - applied in April already. As an FYI, you should be checking Campus Express - they don't send emails.

Definitely not true - I am also an international grad student and was assigned a spot in Sansom Place West last week.



Feel free to PM if you need any help with the application.



Unlike other peer universities, Penn has plentiful off-campus options—most of which are better than the University-owned places.

Hello! Feel free to check out The Radian, we are an off campus complex right across the street from campus. We welcome international students!

Doesn’t sound right.

Do electronic transcripts ordered via Penn in Touch send pretty much immediately?

Title :) thanks

Yes

Yup! Then it’s just on the person/organization receiving them to download them and process them.

Priority Housing Application

Can first years not live in De Bois?

Oh sorry! Yes you can dorm in Du Bois but I forgot to include it

Thank you!! Is it likely I’ll be able to get into one of these suite styles if I wait until after the priority deadline?

Also are you aware of how much the enrollment and housing deposit are?

Yes you probably will find a spot in Du Bois or Gregory. Lauder? Probably not! 

Also, if you don’t know, Du Bois is known to be a safe community for black people so you might not fit in. 



Lauder was my first pick after doing research, it does seem popular. I am black so Du Bois will be a good choice as well! Thanks for all the help

Lauder is very hard, especially if you can’t apply to a Program Community 😅 

Yeah Du Bois is honestly great! A real sense of community, suites… looks cool ngl

Congrats on getting off the waitlist! 



Freshmen can live in 2 houses that offer suites, Gregory and Lauder. The latter is much, much more harder to get into compared to the former. I suggest you do some additional research on both of these houses and rank them as 1/2. Rank the rest as your top 3-6. If you have any other questions, I'm happy to assist.

Anything fun to do @ UPenn this summer?



Breakfast with giraffes!

best way to receive packages on/near campus in summer?

Class of 1920 Commons (or just commons for short)

Get a PO Box. Any carrier can send to them (ask the post office about ‘street addressing’ options).

Class of 1920 Commons (or just commons for short)

Pottruck

Anybody know why pottruck has been closed/when it will be open again?

Looks like they’re closed for maintenance this week and open on the 30th

Cum

It's just given for that academic year and it is as an avg between the fall and spring. So yeah, that situation you listed would get dean's list. (so long as you fulfill the other points here: [https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/deans-list/](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/deans-list/))

penn doesnt do deans list anymore

pls suggest cheap restaurants for dinner w friends, under $15



You can get massive ramen bowls from Ramen Bar (near drexel) for like 12$ pre tax



Edit: there are other places but these have some of the best food near campus imo

Another pho recommendation — Nam Kitchen

DIG? Maybe Pho Saigon, but it may be a little more than 15.

Abyssinia is slightly above your price but its really good, like 17$ an entree. 



Manakeesh should be in your price range I think 





Penang is great too 



Ba Le

Allegros Baked Ziti, talk to Dan

Ed's Buffalo Wings and Pizzas is pretty good. You could get several different pizzas and share. It might not be too quiet or upscale though, as it's like a hole in the wall.

Don bariga!

Lemongrass is good.

Food is amazing but it's pretty expensive for a $15 budget

Lol this is most certainly not within OP’s price constraint

Is UPenn super competitive and cutthroat?

depends if you want it to be. in a campus with 10,000 people, there are certainly subsets of individuals who are super competitive.

This is how I would put it. Yes, there’s a few kids that are cutthroat in the sense they don’t want to help you, but the vast majority would be willing to help. It just feels competitive at times because most people don’t mess around with their classes.

That’s the type of kid they look to admit.

My experience going to a top 50 school and then to Penn as a grad student. What stuck out to me is that everyone gave 100% on every. single. assignment. There was no chill but it didn’t feel competitive in my program.



Penn kids could use more chill.



But comparing my experience to friends in other schools, the student experience at Penn *does* tend to be a bit more competitive and cutthroat.



It also highly depends on the peers you surround yourself with. Needless to say that political science leaning folk tend to be pretty ducking competitive.

It really depends on your post-graduate goal. Are you trying to get into investment banking or consulting? Then yes, it’s extremely competitive and sometimes even toxic. Do you want to do literally anything else? Well it sucks if you said yes cause Penn will almost certainly convert you to a sellout.



In all seriousness, I love Penn and I’m really happy here. I’m in mechanical engineering, and although it feels like I am one of the few engineers that is actually going into engineering instead of a financial sellout job, I feel like I really do have a place here. My main piece of advice is keep your wits about you and if you have dreams about some cool career you want after you graduate, hold onto those dreams and don’t let the culture at Penn convince you out of them. All of your friends will be grinding for those summer internships at McKinsey but you just need to stay level headed and think about where you actually want to end up!

In my experience, kinda mostly yes

This

only if you surround yourself with those kinds of people

https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/ul4s7q/is_it_really_that_bad/

Yes

Not the LSM, M&T, and Huntsman admits. Sometimes VIPER too.

3000% to be frank? You do not have to apply to a single club if you don't want to.  Internships and research positions and jobs are things that people aspire to get.  Trying to get them is stressful for anyone.   It is not necessary to be get fancy internships etc.. at Penn or at Yale, but it is definitely a good thing and students at Penn know this and have advisers that can put this in perspective.  If you want a certain type of position at a certain type of company and that is what does it for you, yeah you will be in a hopefully organized rational effort to get a summer job.  Perhaps if you are at Yale, and get into it (congrats) you may feel a little less pressure at school. The OP might want to learn more about what specific majors and programs may lead to more competitiveness and stress.  It is very program specific and the tolerance to a program depends on your personality.  Maybe Penn is more competitive in some ways than Yale. That does not help the OP unless Yale is one of his choices.

Wasn’t OP asking if Penn was competitive or cutthroat? I feel as though it’s a bit of a yes/no question don’t you think? I based my response off my ex’s experience, and simply pointed out aspects of his experience I thought were more competitive/cutthroat than other universities including Yale. And I definitely think it’s useful advice regardless of OP’s admission status at Yale, as I believe highlighting the points where upenn is unusually competitive, like clubs, would be valuable to OP. And to address the point you made in your post, while at Yale and every other school there are certainly going to be people that are very pre-professional and rush for first year internships and clubs, but from what my ex has told me, there seems to be an abnormally large amount of them at Penn. While this may be different from when you were on campus, I’ve been told that there is a very clear hierarchy of clubs, with those at the top tier requiring numerous case and personal interviews to even be considered. And the fact that there’s even clubs considered “prestigious” should be a sign of the competitiveness of the school

Hi, your views are supported by your experience and thought out so I hope you don't mind a friendly debate -- I just don't agree with you and am a defender of Penn, at least in terms of some of the stereotypes you mention.  I also sometimes feel that students choosing among schools should delve into the realty of their specific situation and chosen path of study.   I could give you some legitimate flaws of UPenn and I don't have a problem listing some of them.  1) they need to hire more CS teachers 2) they need to greatly improve CAPS for better support of student's emotional and psychological needs 3) they should be supportive of a more politically diverse student body so that their is more discourse among people with different political opinions (libertarians, conservatives, liberals, moderates) and allow disagreeable but legitimate thinkers and politicians to speak their views.  I could go on with flaws but competitive and cutthroat are not among Penn's major flaws and if they exist they are not unique to Penn. The Club game is real but it is also at the end of the day a who freaking cares thing. Like many things in life (frat entry, student government) it is partly a popularity contest. Most freshman seek out a few clubs and get turned away to some or all, then keep applying and by their sophomore year they have a club or two that they feel they like or they may not even join one. Life goes on and you may spend your time on more meaningful things like service, research, a work study job, study abroad. Half the people who join clubs quit them if they don't become an officer or president and jump clubs until they are in the upper sphere of that club. Its a game and it is meaningful for those who successfully game it. I think employers do not give a crud about it and are more impressed with other activities. My experience is both past and present. I have a child at Penn now.  That person did not get into all the clubs he or she applied to, found one or two he or she did like and has stuck with two that he or she loves, but it took a couple of years to sort out. OK, now on to this pre-professional dig that some consider a flaw.  This is nonsense. You have three pre-professional schools where perhaps 1/2 to 2/3 of the students reside. By definition they are pre-professional.  Then you have pre-law and pre-med (which you have at every Ivy school in large numbers).  In college most people do want to explore a career or at least figure out a path to a first job or a direction as to a field for a vocation.  It is true everywhere.  Students even at Harvard, Yale and MIT do not go to college to merely engage in philosophical thought about life, they are more often practical about having a useful role in society and getting a job. CAS at UPenn is about the size of Yale and it is essentially a liberal arts college with the freedom to take courses at any of the 3 other schools.  You have the best of all worlds IMO at Penn. It is pre-professional and pre-anything. You do what interests you. I understand that reasonable minds may differ.

Yalie here, but I dated a penn kid for nine months so I think I can speak here. I can attest to how competitively he viewed the entire experience. He was on a mad dash to get an internship halfway through summer and the fact that you all need to APPLY TO CLUBS is absolutely ridiculous. 3000% more competitive than Yale to be frank.

Eh. People stress and exaggerate it. It depends what your program is and who your friends are. All of my friends were more than happy to help me study, and we supported each other.



I disagree with the characterisation that everyone gives 100% on every assignment, at least in undergrad. People certainly care — and some of them care *a lot* — but I don’t think we’re all that competitive/cutthroat. Feel free to DM if you want specific examples or whatever.



Edit: Some professors grade with a bitch curve, though, making some intro courses hella brutal.

Competitive and cutthroat are two different ideas to me.  Most students at Penn want to do well and will work hard.  This in and of itself leads to a competitive environment and most students who are admitted to Penn are used to excelling in HS gradewise and accordingly want this "success" in College.  With nearly 10 thousand undergraduate students, you are going to have all types of personalities at Penn and you will have the same personalities by and large at other Ivy and so called top tier colleges.  Cutthroat -- no. Will you have your occasional back-stabbers and cheaters -- YES. You have that at any school and it is part of life, unfortunately, but is not novel to Penn.

Not really unless you're premed or prelaw

that is a big number.  as painful as this question is... dm me and give me that year.  I don't agree with your assessment, but I would very much like to know the specifics.  i found Penn to be challenging academically but I had GREAT professors.  What you describe is foreign to me, my child that goes there now and my friends.  I do not doubt your experience.

This is a lie

yes.

As a premed, cutthroat is the last word I would use to describe Penn.

In my experience in most classes, barely at all. Most kids don’t even show up to class lol

This is how I would put it. Yes, there’s a few kids that are cutthroat in the sense they don’t want to help you, but the vast majority would be willing to help. It just feels competitive at times because most people don’t mess around with their classes.

That’s the type of kid they look to admit.

This

Not the LSM, M&T, and Huntsman admits. Sometimes VIPER too.

Wasn’t OP asking if Penn was competitive or cutthroat? I feel as though it’s a bit of a yes/no question don’t you think? I based my response off my ex’s experience, and simply pointed out aspects of his experience I thought were more competitive/cutthroat than other universities including Yale. And I definitely think it’s useful advice regardless of OP’s admission status at Yale, as I believe highlighting the points where upenn is unusually competitive, like clubs, would be valuable to OP. And to address the point you made in your post, while at Yale and every other school there are certainly going to be people that are very pre-professional and rush for first year internships and clubs, but from what my ex has told me, there seems to be an abnormally large amount of them at Penn. While this may be different from when you were on campus, I’ve been told that there is a very clear hierarchy of clubs, with those at the top tier requiring numerous case and personal interviews to even be considered. And the fact that there’s even clubs considered “prestigious” should be a sign of the competitiveness of the school

Hi, your views are supported by your experience and thought out so I hope you don't mind a friendly debate -- I just don't agree with you and am a defender of Penn, at least in terms of some of the stereotypes you mention.  I also sometimes feel that students choosing among schools should delve into the realty of their specific situation and chosen path of study.   I could give you some legitimate flaws of UPenn and I don't have a problem listing some of them.  1) they need to hire more CS teachers 2) they need to greatly improve CAPS for better support of student's emotional and psychological needs 3) they should be supportive of a more politically diverse student body so that their is more discourse among people with different political opinions (libertarians, conservatives, liberals, moderates) and allow disagreeable but legitimate thinkers and politicians to speak their views.  I could go on with flaws but competitive and cutthroat are not among Penn's major flaws and if they exist they are not unique to Penn. The Club game is real but it is also at the end of the day a who freaking cares thing. Like many things in life (frat entry, student government) it is partly a popularity contest. Most freshman seek out a few clubs and get turned away to some or all, then keep applying and by their sophomore year they have a club or two that they feel they like or they may not even join one. Life goes on and you may spend your time on more meaningful things like service, research, a work study job, study abroad. Half the people who join clubs quit them if they don't become an officer or president and jump clubs until they are in the upper sphere of that club. Its a game and it is meaningful for those who successfully game it. I think employers do not give a crud about it and are more impressed with other activities. My experience is both past and present. I have a child at Penn now.  That person did not get into all the clubs he or she applied to, found one or two he or she did like and has stuck with two that he or she loves, but it took a couple of years to sort out. OK, now on to this pre-professional dig that some consider a flaw.  This is nonsense. You have three pre-professional schools where perhaps 1/2 to 2/3 of the students reside. By definition they are pre-professional.  Then you have pre-law and pre-med (which you have at every Ivy school in large numbers).  In college most people do want to explore a career or at least figure out a path to a first job or a direction as to a field for a vocation.  It is true everywhere.  Students even at Harvard, Yale and MIT do not go to college to merely engage in philosophical thought about life, they are more often practical about having a useful role in society and getting a job. CAS at UPenn is about the size of Yale and it is essentially a liberal arts college with the freedom to take courses at any of the 3 other schools.  You have the best of all worlds IMO at Penn. It is pre-professional and pre-anything. You do what interests you. I understand that reasonable minds may differ.

3000% to be frank? You do not have to apply to a single club if you don't want to.  Internships and research positions and jobs are things that people aspire to get.  Trying to get them is stressful for anyone.   It is not necessary to be get fancy internships etc.. at Penn or at Yale, but it is definitely a good thing and students at Penn know this and have advisers that can put this in perspective.  If you want a certain type of position at a certain type of company and that is what does it for you, yeah you will be in a hopefully organized rational effort to get a summer job.  Perhaps if you are at Yale, and get into it (congrats) you may feel a little less pressure at school. The OP might want to learn more about what specific majors and programs may lead to more competitiveness and stress.  It is very program specific and the tolerance to a program depends on your personality.  Maybe Penn is more competitive in some ways than Yale. That does not help the OP unless Yale is one of his choices.

that is a big number.  as painful as this question is... dm me and give me that year.  I don't agree with your assessment, but I would very much like to know the specifics.  i found Penn to be challenging academically but I had GREAT professors.

Good morning reddit,



She has been wondering what practical benefits there are to this program. Will she be able to obtain a higher paying position with it? Will her knowledge of animal behavior improve to the point where it will greatly separate her performance from her peers?



The cost of the program is pretty significant, and she was wondering about the cost benefit ratio. There isn't much posted online about people's personal experience, at least as far as Google searches go.



Anyone who has completed this program with any feedback would be greatly appreciated.



Thank you, and I hope everything is awesome for you!

Thank you! That's a great suggestion to try and contact alumni. I'll encourage her to do so.



What I will say is that I had a very positive experience and picked up a very marketable tech-related skill. The instructors were extremely approachable and we ended up forming a pretty tight-knit cohort. However, I don't find that it has really given me much of a boost in my job search efforts – I think people see "certificate" and immediately think of Coursera or edX or the like, and the rigor of these programs is not widely recognized even at Penn. If I had the choice to make over again but had to pay full price, I don't think I'd do it because I'm just not sure the cost-benefit ratio would tip in the right direction.



However, again, I don't have experience with this specific program or with the veterinary field, which may place a higher value on certificates. Plus the UPenn name never hurts, as long as you can emphasize that this was a full-fledged program taught by real professors and not a self-paced Coursera module that you rushed through in two weeks.



As a footnote I'd say maybe encourage your wife to write into Penn Vet to see if they'd be willing to connect her with some program alumni.

Really old webinar/info session recording for this program

Grad school can be a bit mysterious for those who don't know anyone who experienced it.



Think of it as training in big picture thinking and detail-oriented thinking skills.



The isn't a clear cost/benefit besides gaining social and professional connections. She would be working with amazing experts (both professors and other students); will have nuanced discussions about complicated and controversial topics.



The main skills taught in grad school is critical thinking and communicating complex ideas.

In other words, she'll be better able to apply theoretical/experimental research to solve practical problems or improve current procedures.



Bachelors: broad, not too deep. Kind of like a sampler of various fields and different parts of a field.

Masters: more specialized and deeper. Learn how the field approaches problems, how to evaluate what is known, and make informed opinions/decisions.





If she already has a career, she'll get a multiplier to her current level of badassery.



This, of course, depends partially on luck, personal situation, imagination, location, and demand in certain industries.

Again, there are a lot of homeless Phds.

Or tech companies hiring philosophy majors (because they can actually write coherently, unlike me)  https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/16/tech-talent-gap-looks-to-philosophy-majors-ceo-mike-gregoire-says.html

This is grad school, not professional school. 

Just like a bachelor's degree in psychology, it's kind of like a choose your own adventure. 



There are plenty of homeless PhDs

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/03/21/adjunct-professors-struggle-low-wages-no-health-benefits/7114938001/







If your wife doesn't know what they want to do with this credential, then they shouldn't be applying (unless the goal is simply for the fun of learning). 



The program is equally difficult and fun/eye-opening. Grad school is a unique experience. 

If she does this program, she will definitely grow as a person and become better prepared to face bigger personal and professional challenges. 

You will have increased responsibility to go above and beyond to support her through the roughest of times. 

This will be advanced husband-ing.







Thank you! That's a great suggestion to try and contact alumni. I'll encourage her to do so.

Credit card

Does anyone have recommendations for a second credit card - international student, credit score around ~750, been using Deserve for about 1 and a half years

If you’re eating out a lot, Amex Gold is a solid choice. I have international student friends with it (I also have it). Would be happy to send a referral link 🙂



Also, I’d kindly suggest against the Apple Card. If it weren’t for the fact that Apple white labels that card, it would not be nearly as popular. 2% on everything is basically the standard for a decent card (Amex Gold is 2 points on everything, each point about 2 or 2.1 cents). Also, they won’t let you share the data with financial apps like Mint, etc. You also cannot beat Amex customer service. Who wants to support Goldman Sachs more, anyways?

Indeed, it’s $250 a year. However, you get $10/month credits to both Uber and Grubhub. If you’re already using those services, effective annual fee is $10.



> It's not fair to value the food credits fully at $240 because:



>1. You have to use each $10 monthly. Use it or lose it



>2. Would you have specifically used the services from the credits (Uber/UberEATS or GrubHub/Seamless/Shake Shack/other)?



>3. Even if you would have spent on the places specifically, you could've spent the $240 naturally with a credit card and have gotten X rewards. i.e. if I spent the $240 directly at the restaurant with Amex Plat (Resy offer), I would have gotten 15X MRs (3600. At least $36 value at 1cpp, arguably more)



>4. Imagine that it is a worse $120 gift card for Uber and ShakeShack. Would you value a gift card at $120? Probably not (also sometimes gift cards usually have discounts). $120 Uber Gift Card != $120 cash



>I think a fair value for the credits is $200-$230 if you can fully use it. If you don't use Uber/UberEATs or the food credit then of course it's worth much less.



>If that's the case now, your effective AF is ~$20-50.

Fair. A card less focused on these monthly credits would be the Chase Sapphire Preferred. $95 a year and it casts a wide net on high-point categories. 5x on travel, 3x on groceries and restaurants.

Yep! The 5x on travel is only through their portal though and I've seen pretty mixed opinions on that. If that's not an issue it's a pretty good card!

/r/CreditCards has a solid link in their sidebar to the [best cashback cards by category](https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/wiki/best_cash_back_cards_by_category) (no annual fees) if you're looking to maximize for a particular category.



Personally I don't really like the idea of high annual fee cards. /u/uoflcards22's Amex Gold recommendation is $250/year which is pretty unappealing imo - see [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/rp91uw/is_the_amex_gold_still_worthwhile/) for some decent discussion on both sides.



If you want a single card alternative I'd shoot for the [CapitalOne SavorOne](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/) (3% on dining, grocery, entertainment, and streaming). If you have a single high spend category, the Citi card below might be good instead.





- Citi Custom Cash for 5% (up to 500/mo) on your top spending category (usually groceries for me)

- US Bank Altitude Go for 4% on dining

- Bank of America Customized Cash for 3% on a category you choose (I go for online shopping - it's pretty broad and not frequently offered by other cards)

- Venmo credit card for 3% back on your top spend category

- FNBO Getaway for 3% back on travel



Hopefully some of that is helpful!

citi custom cash gives back 5% on any one category up to $500 spend a month if you want a card without an annual fee. right now chase freedom unlimited has a great sign up bonus with 6.5% travel, 4.5% dining, and 3% on everything else so that would actually be my first pick.

I’ve had a great experience with Apple Card. Was my second credit card after Discover Student and got a great credit limit. No fees, 2% back on everything you buy with Apple Pay (which can basically be everything these days), 3% on certain things like Panera, Apple, Nike, Uber, etc. and 1% when you use the physical card. You can also finance any Apple product interest free over a period of time, so I’ve found it to be great as a power Apple user but it may or may not suit your needs.
