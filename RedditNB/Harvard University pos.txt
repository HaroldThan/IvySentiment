Hi, I’m an incoming grad student and a bit overwhelmed with finding roommates/off-campus housing. My biggest fear is that everything will have been rented out by now - so what’s the normal season for people signing leases and will I find stuff that’s still available for a start time in September?



Also if you have any tips for where to look for listings (already on the fb groups and off campus website) that would be super appreciated!!



How did you come to this assumption? I still haven’t heard back from FYRE, and I’m worried I’m the only one.

I believe at this time all programs have come out except FOP

FYRE Pre-O

Has anyone been notified about their status for the FYRE pre-orientation program? I’m assuming that they have made their decisions, and I just didn’t get the notification, but I wanted to check to make sure.

Well at least I’m not the only one. I was already notified by one program, but I really want to find out about the other.

AP score report

Hey guys! On the website, it says that after enrolment we have to submit the AP score report. Is this mandatory however or just optional? I have already submitted the SAT score report just not the AP. And if we do have to send it in, is there a way to only send the scores that were self reported? Thank you!

There’s no reason not to if you have AP scores. They only want it so that you can skip some placement tests, which are helpful for placing you in the right math/foreign language/physics/etc. class.



And to reiterate, you’re already accepted. They’re not going to un-accept you for any AP scores, if that’s what you’re worried about

I would submit it. It helps with course selection I believe

Sending financial aid app late

Title! Incoming freshman and I've never been to the east coast before. I'm probably going to join the run club but I also enjoy running by myself early in the morning & late at night. When doing that or going out with friends, what are some generally unsafe areas to avoid? Any help would be really appreciated.

I run along the river nearly every day, and have gone very early in the morning (almost never anyone there, and it’s great in the summer) and fairly late at night (9-10pm), and have never felt unsafe. I might get a headlamp if you plan on doing late night runs often as some stretches can get dark heading toward Watertown. If you’d like more running thoughts happy to chat.

Runner and long time Harvardian here. Of course safe is always in the eye of the beholder but while you learn the city I would just stick to the Charles River path. I used it to run a few unofficial ultramarathons and on both sides of the river it is very safe even at night (I’m a night runner but a male if that matters). Handy tip: there are currently port a potties near one of the boat houses and a public restroom in the Trader Joe’s both on Cambridge side.



Only advice I have is when you first move here as you go through Harvard square or central square you may get alarmed. There can be a sizable unhoused population and often there is alcohol/ drug use. It can look or feel unsafe to some folks but just know that in both locations there are usually police and despite the appearance those are indeed communities—I mean I know most of the longer term unhoused folks in HSQ. The folks in Central square know most of the police by name and they wave to them and so on. Stay safe of course but also please be kind. 



So basically don’t freak out when you first encounter it. Depending on where you’re coming from it might be new to you. 



Anything less than 10k you can handily do on Cambridge side of river. More than that you can do a loop to the other side of river too but that side is less trafficked very late at night so I’d recommend waiting until you have a better sense of the city.  Congrats on acceptance and best of luck as you move here!

I’m actually down in boston rn - (also a runner and a incoming freshmen) so I can’t comment on safety but the Harvard college side of the river is beautiful. It would be amazing to go on a run down there with the boston skyline stretched out in front of you!

Just gonna say that as a College student, you'll rarely have need or desire to visit either place, especially Mass and Cass.

Downtown crossing (DTX) has been getting a bit sketchy as of late, chiefly at night. I’d also avoid methadone mile unless you *have* to. Beyond that, I’d trust your intuition when navigating Cambridge/Boston and you should be fine. r/Cambridge & r/Boston have more info if you need it.

Yes, over the age of 18. Mace is legal only with a firearms permit. Harvard, however, may not allow it.

Yeah, I wouldn't bring it on campus. I try not to stay on campus late now so I don't have to walk home alone in the dark. Pepper spray and knives are for when I have to leave my apartment after dark alone. I'm certain that OP will be able to find a running buddy to make running safer if for whatever reason they are unable to get pepper spray.

Cambridge is pretty safe. I'd stick to the area around campus to be safe at night. I've walked home at night here plenty of times and Mass Ave isn't bad (except for the time I was followed.) I think Cambridge is probably the safest area to run.



There is a population of people who are living rough (nothing compared to the west coast though). They have caused me no concern except when I worry about them freezing to death whenever it gets cold. But, during the snowy months I didn't see them out. During warmer months I've heard them outside in the middle of night shouting and hitting the dumpster outside my apartment, but they're not going to hurt you. They're just struggling.





Everything on the Cambridge side of the river especially near campus is really safe. The most dangerous parts of Boston tend to be on the south side of the city.

Not sure why you are getting downvoted as that’s good advice.

not there (yet :)) but i imagine running along the river or from harvard - mit and around the outside of campus is never unsafe just because there’s so much activity around the river and square. but my friend who goes to northeastern (if you’re actually going into boston) said that general area isn’t really the “best” of boston (especially the park near the campus)

Really? Where? How so? I didn’t know this..

MIT Campus.

Does anyone have experience bringing pets into HUH? I'll be moving into a pet friendly HUH building off campus and the pet policy is pretty strict when it comes to breed and size of dog. Is there typically any flexibility with the pet policy?

For undergrad housing they're technically not allowed but I knew multiple people who kept secret pets without getting caught. You can also get a sanctioned pet if you can convince admin you need an emotional support animal.

This delegitimizes people who actually need service animals though, please don’t do this :c

I’m pretty sure you can look around and easily find a therapist that will say you need an emotional support animal. They’ll make it official whether you really need one or not

Thanks! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to just ask my current therapist. For some reason I thought I wouldn't qualify, but I probably do.

Just lie about having it as a service dog they won’t question it

10 Everett Street Parking Garage

Hello!





The decal seems pretty pricey, but the convenience and covered parking seem like it could be worth it, unless it’s going to be difficult for me to find spots, in which case I would be pretty frustrated to spend that amount. I’m from out-of-state (the south) so Boston/Cambridge parking is new to me as well as the prospects of dealing with it all in the winter. 



Any information/perspective is appreciated—thanks!

It generally doesn't fill up, especially in the post-covid world.  



If you can't get a permit there, try to get one for 52 Oxford St.  It's about the same distance from Terry Terrace.

HLS Housing Info



I just selected a medium-single room in Gropius-Ames Hall but have heard a few rumors saying the rooms and shared bathrooms are kind of old and messy.



I’ve read all the info available on school’s webpages but still wonder if any current students could provide more living experience and comments? Thanks in advance🥺

I also lived in Gropius and this is accurate. The building looks like a prison and is old (although newer than Hastings, another HLS dorm), but it’s definitely not messy. I think the bathrooms and kitchens get cleaned daily

I’m also going to be a 1L living in Gropius next year! Kind of unrelated question - but is it usually hard to find a free kitchen to make dinner in? It seems like there aren’t that many kitchens in the dorms, but I wasn’t sure how many students used them to make dinner on a regular basis.

I lived in Gropius for 2 yrs. They are old and give off prison vibes (tiny rooms, yellow-tile bathrooms). But they are not messy as the staff does an excellent job keeping the bathroom and hallways clean (keeping your room clean is upto you though). It is the closest + cheapest option around town, so you get what you pay for.

Anyone know when we find out our GSAS housing assignment for the upcoming academic year? Thanks so much!

Thank you!!

I remember reading that it would be the first and now the website says the first week of June

That was unclear - I actually wondered the same thing!

Ok thanks!! I haven’t gotten anything yet, so hopefully sometime this week!

The HUH lottery is finished. You had to register by May 1 (I think?) for the GSAS lottery, but results aren’t out yet.

Oh that’s great to know, thanks so much!

I'm a bit confused by the whole gsas housing situation... I had thought the lottery was finished. Is there still a chance for us to get assigned?

Nothing yet! How about you?

Anyone get any news today?

Thank you!!

I was just wondering and it could also help me answer your question.

If he's from the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium or France then I'm sure the level is as high as Harvard

I don't see Ok-Kaleidoscope-7320 implying in anyway that he is going to base his advise on the OP's "level". Obviously if the OP goes to Harvard,  advices can be given around how this course fits into the general CS curriculum at Harvard.



For real, some people will automatically assume that because we go to Harvard, we must be pretentious.

ok thank you

Trying to park affordably in Longwood is unrealistic, but leveraging MBTA parking is much more doable. For example, the Riverside station is \~30 minute ride away from Longwood and has $105 monthly parking rate for its garage.

You are pretty much out of luck. Maybe someone can present you with a magical parking solution that I'm not aware of, but I would not count on it. There are alternative bus routes outside of the standard MBTA, like M2, that you might want to investigate more. If you have a scooter/motorcycle there are ways you can get free parking for that in the Boston Children's garage which is directly next to the NRB.

It just that my main residence is outside of the city where all of my plants and things are

not yet

Park in Brookline and go for a walk. I used to park by the church by the Longwood stop. Never got a ticket. Alternatively park at the MFA. Get a membership. Go for a walk. Same with parking at Olmsted. Boston is a lot safer than it used to be.

Join Zipcar if you don't mind strangers using the car. Zipcars are parked in specific Zipcar spots.

Are you using the car to do the commute?

ok thank you

Is CS 222 doable without CS 124?

I know 222 isn’t offered every year so I’m pretty keen to take it this Fall. Problem is I can only take 124 in Spring. Anyone taken 222 and able to provide insight? I’m willing & able to put in crazy hours, I’m just wondering if the intellectual bridge is one step too far to overcome without 124.

Thanks for this detailed response! I always had in my mind that 6.006 == 120 and 6.046 == 124, so I was just wondering why 6.006 is sufficient prep? I would have thought 6.046 lectures would be more relevant? But yeah thanks for this!



From the syllabus of CS222 I think it doesn't have much to do with NP analysis and  reduction, which is only lightly touched in 6.006 but heavily discussed in 6.046 and CS124. That is one big reason I dont think the entire 6.046 is necessary.



You may ask the instructor ("Michael Mitzenmacher"??) or Adam Hesterberg  (instructor for CS124) what are the topic selections you need to prepare yourself for. I think Adam is a better person to ask as he is more approachable and also very familiar with MIT courses.



In your question, ask them specifically if CS222 requires dynamic programming. If it does not, then that is even less prep work as it is quite a significant part of 6.006. Please also do verify what I said above - if NP completeness analysis / reduction at CS124 level is indeed not needed for CS222.





With your A in CS20, and doing the above additional prep, I think you might do just fine in CS222, and CS124 will be a lot easier next time you take it, too!

Ah I see, tysm for this!!!!!



\- Watch MIT 6.006 from MIT OCW. In fact this would help you prepare for CS124 as well, and is probably the best preparation I can think of. Especially do a lot of exercises on graph algorithms and hash tables as they seem critical for CS222. Also if possible, write two or three proof by inductions and have a friend who took CS124 look at it for you, to see if they are well-structured.





I think if you take the preparations seriously and you are naturally good at math, then you should be fine. Without prep I think no amount of crazy hours during term time will make up for it. You are likely left behind in the first month and never able to catch up..

I've taken 20, 51, 61 so far

Got an A in 20 and I think I'm pretty comfortable in proofs (at the level of CS20). I've done the 121 background check and I think it was mostly straightforward, except for the bonus questions. Been skimming the 121 textbook and it (mostly) seems to make sense so far

Ah yeah I always get worried by the disclaimer on the multiyear guide is only an indication and not exactly a confirmation that the course will be held. I am really keen to take 222 :(

CS 222 will also be offered next fall by the way, see [here](https://info.seas.harvard.edu/courses/#/multiYearPlan)

Incoming freshman looking for laptop recommendations



The iPad has been my best friend throughout college. Once everything went remote I did every assignment with my iPad and Apple Pencil. The integration with a Mac is insanely good and the combo made me focus on the work and not the technology.

Do you have the regular iPad, Air, Pro, or Mini? 



I'm thinking of buying an iPad myself.

I have the 12.9 inch iPad Pro. It’s the very original and it still works perfect! I love it cause it’s got a big screen to take notes on and to multitask.

Most people will use the recent MacBook Air or Pro. This means most people are rocking the 2020 Macs with the M1 chip.



That said, I think Apple is coming out with some new Macs that will have a Silicon chip so I might hold out until buying a laptop until August to see what goes on there.



Either way, my suggestion would be to make the 4-year investment into the Pro or buy the Air along with an iPad if you can.

Currently use the Air in conjunction with iPad Pro. But I will upgrade to the Mac Pro with the next release. I think an iPad would be way handier for physics, personally.

CS is going to go a lot more smoothly for you if you have a MacBook, or even if you have Linux. Just don’t use Windows

Surface Book Pro 2

OP got a full ride.



However, for your question, I'll assume things like location or money doesn't matter and we're looking at this decision from a purely academic standpoint. If that were the case, I would probably choose Stanford because it has a stronger CS program and due to the startup culture there and proximity to Silicon Valley. 



However, I could very well see students choosings Harvard over Stanford in many cases, even if they are set on CS. Some people want to have a more well-rounded liberal education, and if you're a person that wants to study something like Econ or Gov in addition to CS, then Harvard might be the better school for that.

Living In The Longwood Area

Awesome thanks for the info!

I do! I went to HSPH and lived on Mission Hill next door. Some other folks lived in Brookline / Fenway, all three with very different vibes. 



Mission Hill: brownstones / hilly, lots of college students (Northeastern / MCPHS) and students in general... can get a little rowdy weekend nights. 



Brookline: best way to describe it is a little piece of suburbs in the city; well-maintained, gives off European village vibes. 



Fenway: typical 'city living', close to Fenway Park / BU / pretty centrally located (but also expensive to rent). 



All three neighborhoods are adjacent to and walking distance from Longwood, great public transportation, groceries close by etc (Brookline has a TJ's!). Depends on what you're looking for.

Awesome thanks for the info!

Bank advice.



I liked Cambridge Trust

Cambridge savings is pretty good. I don’t recommend HUECU, unless u plan on receiving scholarships for international travel.

How feasible is it to graduate in 3 - 3.5 yrs?





Ok, thanks! I appreciate the help!









Should you? That's a more complex question that really should not be asked until you've actually lived through a semester.

Ok, thanks! Is 5 classes a semester a lot. At Columbia 5-6 classes would be fairly normal.

Okay, thank u!

Gotta love the double contraction tho



Advanced standing doesn't exist anymore.

Gona miss y’all

Coming back for graduation gave me all the feels this weekend — wanta say I’m gona miss y’all!



I’m proud of graduating and having my degree and the things I’ve done since graduating. But disappointed that I didn’t make more long term friends from here. I wish I would have spent more time on campus and been more present in the time I was here rather than seeing it as something to do and accomplish. 



To the students — Harvard opens up tons of doors — so don’t sweat it. Enjoy your time here and make the most of being with your friends. To the grads — good job y’all. Graduating in general isn’t easy but to do it and grow at a place like here is even more challenging. Until we have a reunion I guess 👍🏼.

What a nice sentiment!



Join your local chapter of HAA. The networking opportunities are pretty good! And many congratulations on your achievement.

Where do you buy necessities?

This, but you should also remember you pay a good chunk of change for dining, and even tho it sucks you should probably limit how many groceries you buy at places like whole foods, which has a pretty high markup compared to places like star market and such. But to each their own. Uber eats is pretty pricey, so I think Amazon prime is the right answer here.

Amazon. Way cheaper than the CVS in the square.

You can take the T to the Target at Porter square from the Harvard station ( Right next to the yard )

Harvard Square CVS

Amazon. Everything in walking distance is marked up massively.

Yard ops gives u free toilet paper 😩

There’s a Target a mile up the street and another a mile down!

Overpriced CVS in Harvard Square

I think it’s more rectangular but I’m not defiant about it.

defiantly the CVS is the square. Very reasonably priced :))))))))))))

Aamazon would be the best option. CVS in the square is super super expensive for no reason. There are a few targets around as well but you'd have to walk for 30 mins to get there (near Central) so it might not be convenient

How to search directory for alumni?

Looking through [https://connections.harvard.edu](https://connections.harvard.edu), even when I log in with my HarvardKey, it only shows people currently affiliated with Harvard. Is there any way to look through a directory of people formerly affiliated with Harvard?

Does financial aid cover the cost of student health plan (blue shield MA one, etc)? Or student has to pay for it? Say if financial aid said we need to pay $12000, if add th student health plan (say it will cost $3000 a year), do we still pay $12000? or $15000?

Thanks for the info. I wonder how it works for non full financial aid folks??

Depending on whether you have health insurance already you either get coverage you pay for yourself or you can file an exception to have your own health insurance counted. But idk how much FA you need to get to have to pay for it yourself. I'll add I didn't have a choice either since I didn't have my own health insurance so Harvard needed for cover me to meet Massachusetts law.

Housing



Student housing for grads is more expensive than just renting a room for one in a 4 bed house. You can try to use your other offers to negotiate a better deal but free housing probably isn't going to happen.

EC10a

CS50

Expos 20



Okay thanks so much!

It's a pretty typical (and doable) schedule.

Thanks so much- one last thing (I’m really sorry): so 22a and b are just like the more proofy versions of the 21 series? I’m still not sure what makes the 21s different from the 22s

Yes, that’s right. The 22 series is essentially the proof-based version of the 21 series. 21b covers more linear algebra topics than 22A but 22 goes a bit more in depth as it covers proofs. Since in theoretical CS courses you have to know proofs, it might be a bit more helpful to take 22 in that regard.

even in am econ + cs you'll probably take some kind of theoretical course so having more background in proofy math is always good

Got it! Okay thanks so much!

That’s a fine courseload. I would say it’s slightly above average for first year fall, but still pretty doable. I did the exact same courseload first year fall (except I did 21b) and it was fine. If you’re doing CS, I might suggest doing 22A first as it might be more useful for CS majors and is not necessarily that much harder than 21.

Psets aré problem sets (homework for classes that aren’t essays). EC psets are due mondays (from this years class) and has two portions, the Multiple choice and the written portion where u apply and explain stuff u learned that week. CS50 psets is coding work but can be very time consuming even for people who are comfortable coding. Math courses usually have either 1 or 3 psets due each week, I forgot which Math21a has specifically but yea. If it’s 3 a week they’re usually due MWF at a certain time. So this course load is pset heavy like the commenter above noted. It’s doable but u need a lot of self control to not let some pass u by and lower ur grade. My tip: find pset buddies! They’re lifesavers in ur time of need and you work thru hw much faster and sometimes with even greater understanding.

Omg thanks so much for this detailed answer haha y’all are all so helpful- this definitely sheds a lot more light on the workload!

Got it thanks!

It's a standard and doable courseload. CS50 might be a little work if you've never coded before, but it isn't too difficult.

Are the ads on "Harvard University Off-Campus Housing" displayed on Facebook Real?

I am currently looking for housing as I will be a graduate student from 2022-to 2023 at Harvard. I came across the FB page and noticed a lot of listings. However, no one engages with them as much as the Harvard University Housing posts does. Are they scams? Should I be aware of the ones that seem similar to other posts? Thanks everyone!



I'm coming from a community college and a little worried I won't be able to keep up.

That's good news!! Thank you!!

This is helpful. Thank you. I assume in person discussions? My CC classes were primarily lecture based. 



Also, did you ever take any history classes?

Yes to in-person – this was pre-COVID.



I took a few history courses. Reading load not as heavy, but grading was usually a bit tougher.

I took ~10 English classes. Lots of reading (some classes are a [thick] book a week) and discussions are pretty intense, but ultimately the grading is extremely lax, to the point where I was shocked by the grades I got on some throwaway papers, etc.

Just lots of reading. Oftentimes things are only difficult when you don't have enough time to properly read everything.



*Cough*...Gov 20...*Cough*

I mean... I just wrote my application and they liked it so I got in.

They liked your application so odds are good that you WILL be able to keep up in your humanities classes.

I hope so!!

how hard was it to transfer?

The English it was very bery good.super.😂

Wow

Calm, you've only scratched the surface of the frustration you are going to experience especially with off-campus housing. Pace yourself mate, you haven't even experienced broker fees yet.

I have been searching for living actually, but I just liked the convenience of apartment housing as offered by Harvard. Like I said in my post, this isn’t even my first option, just convenience.

I'd recommend residence housing your first year here and hope that still works out, cost-wise it'll work out similarly but you're so much closer to the facilities and libraries while you learn the lay of the land and it's easier to connect with people. If not, be very careful of scams. Due to the high rents and amount of people moving here sight-unseen they're ridiculously common.

I’m coming from across the country and really hoping to get residence housing. It’s such a guessing game atp and harder to find a place out of state. Thank you though!!

Thank you so much! I will be on the lookout

I'm in a similar situation rn. I'm attention Design Discovery at GSD this summer and have been looking for housing for weeks and can't find anything. I mean, there are options, but no one wants to lease for just a month unfortunately. I'll recommend hou check out Harvard GSD Facebook group. There are couple of listings currently available there. Harvard's apartments.com also has a bunch of options you should look into. Hope that'll help.

Omg thank you!! Will do :)

hi! anyone knows how intense the 4-yr masters is? Are summer classes required/ advisable?





Thank you!!

It can be a little intense. Had a friend doing 6 class semesters senior year plus writing the master's thesis.



Think it depends entirely on the program. Advice as always is reach out to the director of the master's program and ask them if you'd be able to do it, no one here is going to know more than them.



The main challenge / appeal of the program is that it asks you to take around 6 graduate classes in the field. If you like the material and can do well in the class, it's very nice. If you don't, no point spending your college days doing something you don't enoy.

How much should I worry about GPA?

Sure, to be clear, I don't mean to imply that it is a no-go--just that those programs do actually care.



Your average, say, faang company, startup, ngo, etc.?  Not much.

GPA matters most for highly "academic" paths--MD/JD/PhD, some quant finance shops, etc.  I.e., paths that don't sound relevant to you.



Matters some as a filtering mechanism at your MBBs, ibanks, etc., but you're beyond the common filter--and with an internship you're going to be in a good spot.





Does matter some here, but you're well above the cut line, and they are going to be far more focused on elements of your professional success, at that point, than your GPA (just don't tank it the rest of your time there).

Your GPA is fine.

Honestly my best advice is to just work hard so it doesn’t get any lower. If it gets higher as a consequence, then that’s great!

Update to the update: they'll keep me on campus through the weekend too!

Update: they've told me they'll keep feeding me throughout the weekend.

Turning commencement into a super spreader event would have been hilarious

>Kinda dumb of you to test right before graduation



We apparently have different definitions of dumb esmthin, and likely responsibility. They might have people coming who are trying to be careful, or any numbers of things like trying to avoid spread and minimize risk to others.

It’s literally commencement. There’s no reason to miss your own commencement for testing positive on an optional test. The OP could have just worn a mask if he/she was so worried.

Good day, I am an international grad student starting this fall at HMS. Does any body know how likely it is to get housing at Harvard at Trilogy through the lottery by Harvard Housing?

I have a window for selection June 2

Okie thank you!

Lottery already happened for this year I believe

Trilogy? No way. You were simply unlucky. Trilogy one beds run out by the first week, two beds by the second, and suites by the third week. Unfortunately, all other goods ones are likely gone as well.



Just get something like Peabody Terrace, which I don’t understand its wide unpopularity, and take M2 shuttles for at least a year.

I was shocked when I got June 2 as I started the process very early. Stressed

I'm in the same boat! My lottery selection date in June 2 and for sure there will be nothing left by then 😭. I haven't even started looked for other options yet  really hoping we find something

You already heard about GSAS? I thought they didn’t send lottery results until early June?

Good luck to uss! 😅

Yes thats correct. However I'd been communicating with the person responsible for this via email. After I told them how I'm waiting for it and all, they ended up telling me that they received a list from hgse and as per that I'm 25th on the wait list so there's no chance I'm a part of the lottery. That's how I know already

Gonna pray about it, all the best!!!

You can still try to get a unit from current available after the lottery ends, as people will give up the unit they previously chose. Tho I don’t think trilogy will enter the pool again, you can still have some huh units to choose from.

Here are mine! I love them equally, but some require a good amount of prereq. (You can access past web pages, but videos from the covid year are not available. College policy.)



  

\- K-12 Education (Gen Ed). A unique class with great pedagogy and amazing material. A real "fish out of water" moment for me.  

\- Justice (Gen Ed). It's as good as the public videos look, if you take the courage to participate in class.  

\- CS 61 (Systems). A hard class that forced me to code a lot and brought my blocking group together. The amount of comfort I had before & after taking that class is incredible, and it's pretty accessible to any serious CS student.  

\- CS 227 (Cryptography). A pretty advanced / niche class, but Boaz had so many deep insights about the field.  

\- Stat 210. No one teaches probability quite like Joe does. The hw's are long, but taught me a lot of intuition that I find myself solving problems in 2 lines when peers from non-Harvard background would be integrating 8 lines of math. It's an epic class.

the conflict resolution gened is actually very good if you ignore the undercurrent of self-aggrandizement (from the professor)



Math 113 is also excellent for math/physics analysis requirements because you don't have to do anything but derivatives the whole semester, but that's a product of how complex analysis works and not the class itself

Still a thing, and the lectures are all publicly available!

Gened 1104, iirc

Love that. Thanks!

Approx. 10 hr. class/lab/section per week, plus 30-50 hr. outside of class (working as a group most of the time lmao).  Memorable lines include "learn Python on your own and we'll start putting it on problem sets in a few weeks" and "let's learn linear algebra in two weeks!"  On the plus side, it's double credits and the professors/course staff are seriously amazing people.  TBH, the sheer amount of time and effort for the class, plus the like 1:5 professor:student ratio, lets it teach integrated/interdisciplinary life science in a way that'd be impossible in the scope of a regular course.



Edit: and the Q guide scores are consistently super high too, which I think says a lot about the culture/material

Idk about 5, but for freshmen interested in life sciences LS50's absolutely phenomenal.  Best class I've ever taken in my life.

Does anyone know how often Harvard pays royalties to employee inventors of intellectual property? (Monthly, Quarterly, Annually?)

So if you work for harvard and invent something during your work, you receive a 35% royalty of the net revenues of the product.



But how often is this royalty paid out? Is it monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual?

It doesn't, pretty sure it's homework for some online article/comment. The only interesting thing about it is they somehow found this sub and chose to ask here instead of the million other routes online.

I read that only official tours are allowed, but is there anything preventing me from exploring the area without being a student?

>Are tourists allowed in Harvard Yard right now?



Yes

Have lived in the area 9+ years, even during the pandemic people could visit no problem. It's just like anywhere else: be respectful, don't be disruptive, and you'll be fine. Enjoy the Yard!







https://commencement.harvard.edu/events-schedule has no information about which events do and don't require tickets.



In the past, they've also closed the Yard during big reunion events, like the Saturday picnics.

Figured I’d pop in and ask this question since during visitas I almost lost my shit LOL. How does the gate closing system work? Is it like at a certain time of the night certain gates close - like which stay open typically?

I’m not sure exactly How it works, but the main gates of the yard close around 7 pm. A few random ones that make logical spots for foot traffic stay open. You’ll learn them quickly. 



Johnston, Thayer, Lamont, Widener, and Porcellian Gates are usually open 24 hours. Of course someone who knows the gate names probably knew the schedule already.

Thanks so much, got it!

Some of the gates lock after a certain hour, but several will still be open for people.

Yes.  No.

Yes. We went just yesterday

As an employee and student, yes

I’m not sure exactly How it works, but the main gates of the yard close around 7 pm. A few random ones that make logical spots for foot traffic stay open. You’ll learn them quickly. 



Johnston, Thayer, Lamont, Widener, and Porcellian Gates are usually open 24 hours. Of course someone who knows the gate names probably knew the schedule already.

Thanks so much, got it!

Figured I’d pop in and ask this question since during visitas I almost lost my shit LOL. How does the gate closing system work? Is it like at a certain time of the night certain gates close - like which stay open typically?

rising sophomore taking ec1011a

hi, rising sophomore planning on taking ec1011a in the upcoming fall. I am thinking of doing applied math and ec and want to take ec1011a to see if I truly like ec enough to pursue it (have taken 10a and b before). any general suggestions/experiences/recommendations to prep a bit for it over the summer are welcome

^ have also heard you crank out derivatives

Get really good at taking derivatives fast

It’s good for ur future trust me

Do it

1. Practice taking derivatives. You'll need to be fast.

2. Each lecture usually introduces some concepts and models, with a lot of math in between. I saw people frantically copying the math, but they are not important. Instead, look for the results of the model (usually the comparative statics) and figure out why they make intuitive sense.

hey guys



in a really crazy turn of events I got off of the Harvard waitlist yesterday. it still does not really feel real and I'm very excited about the opportunity.











in general, do most people who want to be placed on a Goldman Sachs-level IB or Bain-level consulting get it or is it still a relatively low percentage?



this last one is probably really dependent on who I ask but what is the work/life balance like? I'm sure the classes will be super difficult and require a large time commitment, but how is the social scene?



I think this is most of them but I'll edit this or something if I think of others



thanks!

There's no social scene, but the campus is leagues better than Notre Dame. Notre Dame is basically a flavorless enclave with a few chains in a food court and a 1.5 hour train ride to Chicago, surrounded by a dying town and next to a richer town with a...mall.



Cambridge is an enclave of banks and Corp shops then some local shops, ready access to Boston via the T and the Charles river. More likely to get your bike stolen, but there's keytar bear and a guy who needs his flat fixed. I have issues with Cambridge but not compared to Notre Dame.



It's competitive, but everyone wants you to get to where you want to go and if you're doing the work you should get there (and if you got in you should be able to do the work). Life balance really depends on your program, but lives are overrated. You only get to do this once, try not to make the choice out of fear.

Just adding on to the work/life point - Ec can be an extremely light major or a fairly time consuming one. There are relatively few required courses so it's really up to you how difficult you want to make it and what non-major classes you want to take alongside it. If you like math, you can take a lot of very math heavy courses. If you prefer writing papers, there are also lots of options to do that. 



>I feel like I always hear about grade inflation at Harvard and I'm curious what its actually like. obviously I'm guessing it's difficult to do well in the classes there but do curves help a lot or something?



Grade inflation does not correlate to the difficulty of the course material and how much time you'll be spending outside of class. Harvard classes will be difficult. However, grade inflation definitely exists here. Not to the extent that everyone will be receive an A or it is easy to receive to an A, but the reality is in most classes the overwhelming majority of grades tend to follow in the B+ to A range and it's rare for people to receive Cs (or lower) in classes (even though it does happen on occasion). Ultimately, if you focus on academics, you probably keep your GPA over a 3.6 here (the average for each graduating class is usually over/under 3.65), but there's no guarantee you'll get a 4.0 or anything.



>what is the atmosphere on campus like? above all I want a school that is collaborative among its classmates. does it becomes especially cutthroat between Econ majors who all want to be placed in big 3 consulting or the major IB?



Honestly, compared to what we hear from other schools, I would say Harvard students tend to be pretty collaborative and it's not super cutthroat or competitive. Others can feel free to disagree.



>in general, do most people who want to be placed on a Goldman Sachs-level IB or Bain-level consulting get it or is it still a relatively low percentage?





>this last one is probably really dependent on who I ask but what is the work/life balance like? I'm sure the classes will be super difficult and require a large time commitment, but how is the social scene?



It  depends on what classes you take and what is your major. I'm planning to concentrate in CS, and from my first-year experience alone, it's definitively more work than life and my prospective sophomore year courses are supposed to be more difficult. However, CS is one of the most time-consuming majors. For Econ, I would believe there is more of a balance + (again) it really depends on how much you prioritize academics.



Feel free to PM with more questions.

Also, it seems that the school you are currently committed to is Notre Dame and the costs are the same.



With that information, even though Notre Dame is still a fantastic school with an excellent business program, I don't know why you wouldn't choose Harvard. 



Outside of just prestige, Harvard is simply in a better location. We're talking about Boston vs. Indiana.

It’s not crazy to choose ND over H though many people will tell you it is. They are very different schools and you need to think about which is a better fit for YOU, not which is the better school. 



ND is gorgeous and the campus is the universe. This combined with the…sports fervor (very cool btw) creates a strong community. Harvard is embedded in Cambridge and adjacent to Boston and while most students don’t go to Boston all that often the proximity helps Harvard feel not so, well isolated. But the price for that creates a community that is not as cohesive as ND. 





Econ at H. is huge with a pipeline to the Wall Street financial sector — but it’s huge and it’s competitive. Even the consulting clubs here are competitive. Just a lot of people trying to do the same thing…



Both schools have strong alumni support. Sure Harvard is more prestigious but ND alums are zealots (in the coolest sense of that term!). Prestige isn’t a good reason to choose a school imo. 



ND is a catholic school. That informs the community. This might be important to you. 



H is more…diverse. You will find your people, but there are really lots and lots of disparate groups. Might take more time. This might be exciting to some and chaotic to others.

Daamn congratulations!

> in general, do most people who want to be placed on a Goldman Sachs-level IB or Bain-level consulting get it



Yes.

life sucks and school sucks. jk try to join the consulting club, it’s competitive but it sounds like you’d enjoy a challenge. I don’t think every class is cutthroat, there is some inflation but it depends on the class. join PBHA or other service orgs, definitely more collaborative feel there

I'll answer atmosphere, career & social, since they're more fun :D



Atmosphere: most people are really chill, especially after 1st semester freshman. What people are doing is so different that when you meet someone, there is nothing you need to "prove". So, people are quite nice and will often just share fun stories. There are definitely cutthroat people still, but I ran into like 3 in my time here.







Econ is one of the more chill majors and you should have a pretty good balance, e.g. doing homeworks on weekday nights then you have Friday night & weekend free. Premeds and CS have it tougher.

Hi, I'm a student at Dartmouth and I've been told by some upperclassmen that you can take certain courses at Harvard. How is this possible and can I take these in-person over the summer?  Thanks

Audit?

When are grades due?

I still haven't received a grade from one of my classes. Do you know when all grades should be entered?

Which means the absolute latest grades are due is today. So hopefully we’ll get them tomorrow?

Yes, assuming all your professors post their grades on time, you should be able to check you grades by 12:00 AM tomorrow.

You can view due dates for grades by course at this link: https://infoforfaculty.fas.harvard.edu/book/due-dates-grades.

Commencement regalia question

Typically those denote organizational affiliation or honors. There was no rule about those at my undergrad institution, you could even create one to show pride in what what you had accomplished. 



Several organizations sent out emails about stoles a few weeks ago. If you are part of the organization just reach out to them.

What are the best resources to prepare for CS121?

There are a few resources that have been shared by past iterations of the course. This document from last fall: http://madhu.seas.harvard.edu/courses/Fall2021 has a few resources, most notably problem set 0 (which there will probably be a similar or the same pset for this fall). 



A more comprehensive resource is the background section of the course site from Fall 2020, https://cs121.boazbarak.org/background/

Boaz will be teaching the course again this fall so this is probably a little more relevant. Based on what you said, looking at some of the resources for MIT 6.042 linked on that page will probably be the most productive for you (although be sure to enjoy your summer!! There are a ton of in-semester resources for CS121 and preparation on the level of CS20 is exactly what’s expected of students)

TheoryPrep is a GREAT resource! It was a volunteer program a bunch of CS121 and CS124 TFs did the summer of 2020 that was super helpful in gaining a lot of the skills that make those classes more doable. The link to the website is here, and I recommend watching their lecture videos and going through the psets yourself: https://alex-kj-chin.github.io/theoryprep/

Pre orientation and move in question for 2022

Celeb Kids at Harvard

Yeah, I'm here.

"CEO of Microsoft's daughter" 



Sir, touch some grass, psets could wait. /s

Yara Shahidi



The CEO of Microsoft's daughter goes here.



There are plenty of other kids who have parents that are multimillionaires/billionaires.



That said, it's not that big of a deal. They might have famous parents, but they're just normal teenagers/young adults.

Malia Obama... the simplistic idiocy of the American celebrity subculture never ceases to amaze me.

Yeah - Malia Obama just graduated, for instance

>Is it really true that children/relatives of A-list celebrities/TV personalities etc are currently at Ivies/T10s but current students are supposed to be lowkey about them?



Is there a directive given by the administration not to fangirl around them? No. Assuming other students even know who these kids are, is it common sense to behave normally? Yes.

My brother in law went to the Kennedy school a few years back and one of his best friends in the program was a former 90s child star. I thought it was nice that the guy could find a completely different thing to do with his life than what he was originally famous for.

Yes, in the graduate schools too in my experience. Billionaires' children, a president's kid, children of major corporate/media/political/academic figures. It's less that you're supposed to be lowkey—it's pretty natural when they're just a classmate working on the same things as you

My roommate was the great nephew of the inventor of the Pap Smear.



A true brush with greatness.

Would be kind of weird to not be lowkey about it - you're going to see them around so probably better to not make a big deal out of it.

Oh lmao

Ik a few sheikhs from the royal family and they operate on a different level than those celeb kids

I've been in classes with some or seen them at parties, it's not that you're supposed to be low-key but they're normal people while on campus. Freaking out or anything else is just rude to them.You can have cordial conversations with people but if you're weird about it you'll be avoided.

Muqueca is fantastic. And if you're referring to rivers Cuomo i wouldn't really call him pop



But yeah great description of this phenomenon

Yeah, he's the one.  I have no idea what kind of music he makes.

Lead singer of Weezer, they're kinda alt rock

> alt rock



Come on, that's a kind of pop!  It's got, like, electric guitars and stuff!

Lol music with electric guitars is pop? What does rock have?



They've only ever been nominated for or won awards in categories or Rock and Alternative, never Pop

> What does rock have?



Rock is a kind of pop music, as far as I'm concerned.



Also some really famous violinist was in the music theory class I took, the year before I took it (I had friends in it).  People were really impressed at the final concert.  I was... not?  I mean, guy knows how to play his instrument, great.  So did most everyone else there.



Also some pop musician (whose name I won't disclose) went to Harvard at the same time I did; he was finishing his undergrad but was over a decade older than most other students.  A lot of people made a pretty big deal about it.  That wasn't my type of music, so I never really paid much attention there, but apparently it was a thing, I don't know.



Also one of my good friends was blockmates with Mark Zuckerberg.  But he wasn't famous; he was just some dude.  And Eduardo Saverin, original Facebook investor, once took me back to campus from a Brazilian restaurant in a taxi -- we went to a local Brazilian place with the Harvard Brazilian Organization (Muqueca in Inman -- it used to be a hell of a lot cheaper back then, but it was still delicious last I checked) when I started getting really sick (not getting into it, but it wasn't related to the food).  He called the taxi and made sure I got to my dorm OK.  Then he went on to be instrumental in starting Facebook.

Are there any spaces to exercise outside?

gyms don't open til 6am on weekdays - I'm a fitness instructor there and my coworkers always have people in their 7-8am classes so Id assume there are two peaks (open and then around dinner time 5pm on)

  [facility hours](https://recreation.gocrimson.com/sports/2021/5/14/facility-hours.aspx)  so you know when the gyms are open :)

Wow ! Thanks so much this is very helpful❤do you  know if there are any outside exercise spots, I'm kinda shy:/

Most of the outside sport are going to be intermurals with teams. The gym hosts group fitness classes outside in the fall (weather permitting) but those tend to be dance classes. Until you feel more comfortable around others I would recommend checking the virtual fitness classes (same link) it’s just zoom classes you can keep cameras off. But if you choose a group class or an intermural people will be happy to have you and make you feel welcome, especially group fitness led by my coworkers and I

Thank you so much!!!❤️

gyms are usually empty around mid-day (10am-2pm) but summer will be a slow time regardless.

Yes u do just ask someone to swipe u that’s what I did lol

What time did you go? I'd like to exercise early in the morning but I don't know if there'd be anyone outside:/

I'm partial to using house gyms when the weather is particularly bad, and there's usually no one else around most of the time. Only downside is that you'd need someone else to swipe you in if you don't live in that house.

Is CS107 worth taking?

I am planning on concentrating in CS, amd I am taking CS120/121 + Stat110 next fall. I am looking to see of I can find a third CS class that's fairly manageable, and I can improve my skills. I took CS50 + CS51 freshman year. I looked at the Q-Guide, and I'm not sure CS107 would advance my skills given that I've taken CS51. Has anyone taking CS107 after CS51? Is it worth it? Also, are there any other CS courses (other than 61) that some concentrators take in their somphomore fall in addition to 120+110?

When are 2022 fall courses released?

For students at the College, do we not have swipe access into any of the buildings anymore after May 15? Can we even get into some of the libraries like Widener or Lamont?

According to the librarians at cabot, we can still get into the libraries now that they're open!

Harvard Housing Help: Pls help identify where these lovely apartments are



Oh man. As an international student, navigating brokers and identifying authenticity is anyway a challenge. Hence been sticking to known brokers that friends have used.   





This is very helpful though. DMing you.

Hey! I was in your same situation 2 months ago. Any time I found an apartment on FB marketplace that seemed “too good to be true” they were 100% scams. They’re getting so elaborate nowadays that I even spoke on the phone to a “realtor” who sent me the application and everything. I only found out because I googled the rental company and there was nothing about it anywhere. Please be careful out there! I actually ended up using a realtor, if you DM me I can send you his info. He did a great job and was well worth the brokerage fee.

Ouchie. Hurts, but good to know.

100% scam. seen the same apartments. the ones too good to be true are fake

None of those look like they're Harvard Housing. They're probably off-campus. And have you made an applicant account with Harvard Housing? Many of the units are likely taken already.

yeah, these aren't HUH apartments. You'd have much better luck finding a roommate and searching off-campus. BUT you should start super quickly, as many apartments get taken off the market quickly.

They look like Cambridgeport or the Broadway area.  Might be Somerville somewhere.  Porter Square area?  Up near Tufts maybe?  But apartments around the Camberville area are all mostly pretty similar; those pictures are pretty normal.  I've been to countless apartments just like the ones in the pictures, and I've lived in some too.  They're around.  I don't know how much they cost these days, probably a lot, but those apartments are completely normal for the area.

I'm the original poster. The test with the pictures didn't get submitted.

Ah, that makes sense.



Yes I have registered. My lottery is on the 18th.



Any suggestions on good 2B2B?

Makes sense. You're right - they're going off the market like hot cakes.





Again, any advice on good 2 or 3 beds on campus would be very helpful if you.



Thank you nonetheless.

>Again, any advice on good 2 or 3 beds on campus would be very helpful if you.



You're not going to find a 2 or 3 bed on campus...I assume you mean off. Check CL and apartments.com  several times a day.

Hi,



  

I am starting grad school this fall and have been relentlessly looking for apartments through the HUH website. I am seeking a 2B2B or 3B with 2 or 3 Baths, with the per resident cost at \~$1,400 / month.  

I've found some nice ones (e.g.  One Western Avenue, Peabody and Cowperthwite Street) -- they are compact, with necessary amenities,  but  nothing spectacular.  

However I'm on FB groups with GORGEOUS apartments - old school, large, wooden flooring, arched doorways, plenty natural sunlight - available for summer sublease, all within the same price range. I simply can't understand which these housing units are (I've messaged but haven't heard back).  

Seeking urgent help in identifying which units should I be looking at to find these. Sharing some sample pics. PLSSS help!  

THANK YOU!

ideal number of roommates to maximize cleanliness & getting a good room?

title! incoming freshman and not really sure how many roommates i should indicate on the housing form. having 5-6 seems excessive & i'd prefer having less but i'm not really sure how many is ideal. pretty flexible, i just want to have a clean room/suite and a relatively spacious/good room!! thanks so much!

This is the right answer for cleanliness. It’s the only way to guarantee that the standard of cleanliness is your standard.

The cleanliness of your suite really depends on who your roommates are rather than how many you have. 



There isn't an ideal number.

There isn't an ideal number, and I wouldn't try to game the system. My freshman year I put down 3 roommates but was given only one. We had an in suite bathroom and a common room, so I ended up with a single, which later on I appreciated. They will place you where they want to, and it is impossible to predict how they think. A lot of it is also heavily dependent on which dorm you are placed. So instead of focusing on trying to get a good room, focus on how many roommates you want and thinking about the life you want to live. Just fill out the survey honestly because filling it out incorrectly most likely won't even get you what you want.

To maximize cleanliness... 0. But I was always willing to sacrifice cleanliness for meeting new people. In my opinion the more roommates the better since it's very rare that you'll have a terrible roommate. If you don't share interests with them, you don't have to hang out with them, but I'd rather risk having have roommates who I'm not best friends with than no roommates at all. 



lol

This is the right answer for cleanliness. It’s the only way to guarantee that the standard of cleanliness is your standard.



How much should I charge them?

The fee is like $50 so at least that.

thanks adviceguru!

Happy cake day



No it wouldn't. You shouldn't even have to clean it to be honest.

>Cleaning it isn't worth your time and you won't get comp'd for the work



This guy Harvards

Yeah, even if you clean it and ask your roommate for money, there's no guarantee they'd actually pay you back ....

There’s a -22% chance they’ll pay if they were willing to leave it trashed in the first place.

You should just report it to administration. Cleaning it isn't worth your time and you won't get comp'd for the work. Just let them know and move on.

Sichuanese are dogs who only play the glory of the king

where are some nice places to study with lots of sunlight ?



They asked for nice places...

The Smith Center

Smith Center roof deck!

Quad yard!

Science Library (facing the plaza), the empty pedestals on either side of Widener, the cafe or the library at the GSD or Quincy dhall in the early afternoon

It's getting warm enough to use the Yard.  Or JFK park...or Radcliffe Yard, Cambridge Common, Quad Yard, and so on...



If you need to be inside, Harkness Commons or 2nd floor of Langdell Library at the Law School.  There are tables you can use at Northwest Labs, as well, both in the first floor hallway on the west side, and the cafeteria.  Gutman Library has some nice sunny spots, too.

Smith campus center!

So there is a little garden by the Class of 1959 Chapel, right across Gordon Rd.

They asked for nice places...

Roommate application

First, the biggest key is to just be honest. Some people try to present who they *want* to be on the app and not who they *are* and that'll just get you paired with non-ideal roommates. Figure out what you really like and be sure to express that strongly. My freshman year roommates and I all loved music and that was a really good bonding activity for us the entire year and helped us become really good friends immediately for example.



Some basic important things to think about and be sure you answer honestly are how clean do you want the room, how do you feel about smoking and drinking, how loud are you comfortable with the room being at different points of the day(our room was a hangout space for other people so it was loud until people went to bed. If you were a in-room studier this could've been difficult for you), and related to that what time do you like to go to bed.

Thank you . I hadn't thought about the lights things either 😟

“I should probably include that I don't like heavy drinking , which I can see now is really important.“

Mental Health Awareness on Campus - Filming a Documentary

i’m visiting cambridge for only a day and am looking for examples of mental health culture on campus (eg. posters, signs, anything with mental health messaging on it). i’m making a documentary and am hoping to find some good footage for b-roll. any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!







Thank you!

C++ has data structures in the standard library such as hash tables, which could be useful for your problem sets.

Kind of meh online (I did it last year), but I ended up meeting cool people who I've stayed kinda close with! It'll prob be a lot better in person lol

As long as you don't have a C or lower, you're fine.



Even then, you would probably still be fine.

That isn’t quite true. Every school where a student matriculates receives a final transcript, which will include senior grades. Having said that, I don’t imagine B and better grades would matter.

Yes, they get the transcript that shows graduation, but they don’t evaluate the final semester’s grades.

Not quite true. More like they look for major red flags and ignore the rest.

They don’t recheck your grades after admission. They just get confirmation that you graduated.

Lmaooo bro I got the same exact grades as u rn as a senior too

haha thank you so much lol but i’m a pre fosh.. but thank you i’ll probably be in the same situation four years from now

Oh, a High School senior. Sorry...

ty!

ur all good don’t worry! u only have to worry about Cs or lower tbh, and even then if u wrote a good explanation to them they’d probably be chill. in this case, absolutely no explanation needed!

Man I’m actually worried now, I got 1 C now but it’s in AP Chem. Then I got like 2Bs and the rest A’s

Hey all,



cheers, thanks.

I don't know for sure but my friends who have attended all recommend getting a move on quick.



Best time for looking for Sept 1st is March/April, that's when the listings will start. Moving on Sept 1st is a nightmare around Cambridge. You can find stuff in other times, but you are playing roulette; it may be there's a vacancy because someone bailed on the landlord, or it may be they left because keytar bear lives above them and it's now your problem for the landlord to ignore.



I'm in the same boat. I've seen a lot of places where the broker fee = one month's rent. Also would love to know when the best time to start looking for a fall place would be. I've had brokers tell me that I need to have a place nailed down by June for Sept 1 but others have told me that's bs.

thanks amigo.

It sucks, but one month's rent is usually the standard broker fee. Also, in terms of finding new leases (which is where a broker would be involved), it is indeed "the earlier the better". 



However, if you're looking to replace a roommate on an existing lease, then there's a high likelihood of dodging a broker's fee and also more time flexibility, with the tradeoff that you don't have as much control over whom you live with. Keep an eye on the Facebook groups for this; good options continue to pop up well into the summer.

Sounds like the dream.

It was a great place, and my wife and I miss the time in our lives when we lived there.

Man, I'm so glad that when I needed to find my own place, my brother found a private landlord for whom we didn't need any broker fees. $1300/month in the early 2010s for a 1 bedroom apartment with free heat and parking space included in Brookline less than 10 minutes from the Longwood Medical Area. No rent increase ever while I lived there.



I wonder how rare it is to find that kind of private owner, no broker situation nowadays.

cheers, thanks.

Have you asked the magic conch?

Lacrosse Team Walk On

that’s great to hear, thank you so much!

My roommate walked on and I know a few other kids who have. People I know who’ve walked on were definitely good in high school but I wouldn’t say super outstanding. Don’t think the bar is nearly as high as being recruited.



that’s great to hear, thank you so much!

I'm sure this gets asked every year so sorry in advance!



you might not get the one you want, you have to fill out an application/ write essays and some people get rejected or waitlisted from the pre-o of their choice so keep an open mind and hope for the best. but the pre-orientations are all different, since it was virtual last year my experience was vastly different than most. but i really enjoyed fyre (since identify with being first-gen) but i heard that fop wasn’t too great since there weren’t any trips. but other people have also enjoyed fup so it’s up to you, choose whichever you identify with more ig (it’s also not that deep!)

FIP is great if ur an international student! Met some of my closest friends there

I was literally about to ask this so thank you lol



I'm trying to decide between FYRE, FAP, or FUP, so if anyone can share some more about these programs, I would really appreciate it!



not a big deal, really

pretty low, other people apply so make sure those essays are well written

Student interested in subletting a place this summer

Friend (current student) is subletting—PM me and I can send contact info!

Hi! I’m subletting my room :) beautiful house with kind roomates and a lot of light

Hi folks. Any law students here who have stayed in North Hall before? Would love general thoughts, but especially any advice on picking a room with good sunlight... can't tell from the floor plans but I just want lots of windows and light. TIA!

Pick a room on the Mass Ave side.





Also, don't really care about GPA (anymore), just want to possibly take an additional course that will be interesting, help me learn, or improve my skills. 





I meant in the context of them being a senior, they should enjoy the rest of senior year (and high school) before worrying about taking classes in college. 



We're already in college, sadly :///

In the words of some other redditor: “It's May. You're thinking of classes a little too soon.”

Only recommendations are:



- always have a pset group, never try to solo carry yourself



If you wan't an extra course just find a gem IMHO

How about CS107?

<3



How about CS171? Is it mangeable having taken CS51 and 50, and will I learn anything?

105 is chill. 182 should be chill.

How do you want to apply your skills after you graduate? Any interest in public health (epidemiology might be a nice stats compliment) or national security? Economics always helpful for that glitzy NYC future.

I plan on studying CS, and I wouldn't say I am interested in going into theoretical / academic CS. Which class is more practical and prepares you better for CS 124?

It’s okay. The workload is intense, but always rewarding in the end. People are eh — I think many of us are usually too busy or stressed to make any meaningful connections.

I'm a CS Columbia kid also scrolling through this sub. I completely agree with this assessment of CU culture and the CU academic experience. Drowning in work and few friend connections -- yep. 



Also, an intro algorithms class will defs helps with data structures!!!



I've taken CS20, but haven't really had much proof experience outside of that.

I felt unprepared for 121 with CS20. The people who do well in the course have taken 25,55,etc.

Yes, I definitely think that would help.

Based on the course descriptions, 120 fits preparation for 124 more.

I just took CS124 with Adam. He is the best. He is as good as you can hope for an instructor for an algorithm class. (I dont know about CS121 so no comment on that)

I thought Boaz was really good but I know other people disagree.

You probably aren't going to find someone who took both, so I will just give some thoughts having taken 121. I wouldn't worry too much about which one prepares you better. I would see who is teaching it. Adam frequently co teaches 121 and imo is the worst lecturer in the CS department. I'm not sure who teaches 120, but I might chose 120 just to make lectures tolerable. I would imagine that if you took either you should be relatively prepared to take 124. However, 121 is the tried and true way to prepare for 124, while 120 is still unknown. I do wish 120 was available when I took 121, as I would have chosen 120.

the 120 prof was an advisor for me a while back and is the sweetest person ever, super supportive and approachable!

Bit of a long shot but worth a shot - Could somebody take a photo of the SEC Building?

Hi!



I'm a PhD candidate from Europe currently concluding my research in the context of Facade Engineering. I would love to include a photo of the SEC building as it's quite a beautiful example of performance-driven facade shading ([https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbehnisch.com%2Fwork%2Fprojects%2F0274&psig=AOvVaw3aK3VdJ3LntDz3GtmWAd4X&ust=1652033664377000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAwQjRxqFwoTCNDzmJL\_zfcCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbehnisch.com%2Fwork%2Fprojects%2F0274&psig=AOvVaw3aK3VdJ3LntDz3GtmWAd4X&ust=1652033664377000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAwQjRxqFwoTCNDzmJL_zfcCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) < for context)



Unfortunately all the images I could find are under copyright.. Would any kind soul be able to take a photo of the Facade (I'm mostly interested in the sheet metal material, as this is what my focus is on). Of course, I'll give full credits to you! (Proper name though... too scared of what reddit user names could pop up :D )

no problem, thank you so much for the offer anyway!

Uhhh…. It’s kind of cloudy today. The light’s not great. I can pop over there if no one else does, though, just let me know. I’ve been procrastinating on going to Allston for a few things anyway.

OH wow! Thanks so much, wasn't expecting responses to be honest :D

recommended expos courses

Incoming prefrosh here. I’ve heard that some expos classes can be loads of work have really harsh grading and are really hard to manage while others involve watching movies as assignments. Are there any recs as to which expos classes are the most interesting/fun with a reasonable amount of workload?

Oooo good movies!

Take the expos with the subject matter that appeals to you. You’ll be reading a lot of material and if it’s not something you’re inherently interested in, it’s going to be a slog. 



The watching movies bit might be freshman seminars. I had one of those and it was great.  But haven’t heard of any expos where you just watch films. 



You can also look at Q guides.

Politics of Nostalgia! Dr. Pietras is a great teacher. Our class was structured like this 

1st assignment - Short paper based on a 6/7 page reading 

2nd assignment - longer paper based on the movie Carol (2014) or the first two episodes of Mad Men (2008) 

3rd assignment - 10pg paper on any subject relating to nostalgia. I chose a film and had to support my arguments using primary and secondary sources. 





I thought the workload was pretty reasonable, at least compared to other "paper classes" in the English, etc., departments.

femme fatale, Mars, remembering the civil war, I think most of the sections my firstyear had movies as assignments



I heard it was a bad Expos, though, at least a couple years ago

>others involve watching movies as assignments.



I'm unaware of any sections like that.



>Are there any recs as to which expos classes are the most interesting/fun with a reasonable amount of workload?





Pick the topic that interests you the most. Crosscheck with instructor reviews. Hopefully the good topic will also have a good instructor.

Don’t make the mistake of assuming a class with film sources will be easier than selected readings. Simply put, there’s never going to be an EXPOS class that doesn’t stress-test your limits. And that is okay! It’s the purpose. So, dig as much as you can to find your best fit. First, narrow down the topics you are interested in (each section is different). Then, cross-check those courses to find one lead by a fantastic instructor. I don’t believe the difficulty of EXPOS is in the grading… the instructors spend plenty of time with everyone and there are many opportunities to receive great feedback and polish your papers. It’s hardest to undo bad habits and refine attention to detail all while learning to make the best insightful connections.  Pick a topic that excites you, buckle up, and remind yourself it’s only one semester. You’ll be just fine!

Are Prison's Obsolete?

Oooo good movies!

Other than having it noted. I mean, you are either fluent or not which should be apparent when conversing.

Personal satisfaction. That's it.

Some quality DNA, a healthy ovum, and a willing uterus really are all you need.

with potions

Lol making new people

thank you!

I put that I wanted 4-5 roommates, and ended up with one. I’m not saying what you put doesn’t matter, but don’t stress it too much. They put in way more effort to matching freshies than any other school I’ve ever heard of.

make sure you emphasize the alone time in the long response! the number of roommates you input isn’t near binding, but they usually try to match preferences (i asked for 3, got 1, but it worked well)

You won’t get much alone time with roommates. If you really value alone time, I would opt for a single and meet new people elsewhere.

thank you!

What did you put on the housing survey?

incoming freshman and kinda freaking out tbh. what did u all put on there, I wanna be sure I don’t forget anything important 😭😭

LMFAOOAOAOOAOAO

Just answer honestly. There’s nothing to forget. Just go through the questions. No way to work the system here, just trying to match you up with others who have the same habits and preferences.

i was as honest as possible - how quiet i need it to sleep, how i'm messy, how i can't stand loud noises, etc.

Advice for Filling out Housing Survey

Hello! I’m an incoming freshman and I’m currently filling out my housing survey. It definitely seems a little overwhelming, so I was wondering if anyone had any advice on filling it out. I know that each person has their own preferences, but does anyone have anything they wish they put differently in hindsight? Thank you!!

Hi! For sociability  what happens if you rate low? I like being with people but I like having my own space to recharge

I actually recommend putting that you want many roommates since chances are better you will get along with at least one of them! Also all the Grays suites are for either 4 or 5 :) Definitely rate your sociability and cleanliness higher than it actually is.

Try to get a single room by saying u love walking around in u dorm and sleep naked!

I don’t think much else would, but it’s a way to get a certain type of roommate if you want one

first - the deans are hand matching these. They read applications and deliberately put them together, not an algorithm. Keep this in mind as you fill it out. 

Second - If you enjoying going out at all, enjoy having even a couple people over, or anything social of the sort, I recommend putting ur sociability/hosting people score high. Getting stuck with someone who doesn’t allow anyone over (cuz we both put sociability as medium or something) SUCKS!

Third - if you have any particular living quirks, like room temperature, scents, or anything, PUT IT ON THERE. what seems reasonable to you can seem crazy to others. 



Best of luck! I hope you have a good roommate in the fall.

I don’t know why the form is so detailed and the “matchups” were anything but. People can be really gross. The things I’ve seen. I truly envied those singles in Canaday….

Do not underestimate the need to recharge. There’s going to be a lot going on first year. Your dorm needs

to be a place of peace. I listed the most roommates and put a 5 for cleanliness. Lived in squalor with 3 other people, who also put 5s. But I was the only true 5. 



I’m sociable and wanted to meet people and roommates felt like free friends, and sometimes they are, but mine tuned out to be just people who I lived with that were really unsanitary and sometimes annoying. 



You’ll have a lot of opportunities to meet people and make friends, even in a single. Just depends on how risk averse you with the roommate lottery. 



I would answer honestly based on what you want and your habits.

Other than that just be honest about what you want lmao

Some people aren’t built for living with 4-5 people but I will say if that’s something you’re not opposed to, the odds of getting along with at least a couple are higher and grays and weld are typically the dorms with 5-6 man suites and they’re really nice relative to other ones. I was in weld and had a good time

Who the hell wants Apley

I got Greenough mentioning those.

Idk, it seemed pretty cool, like Claverly for fershmens

Just say you want Apley or Grays, and that you’ll cry if you don’t get in.  



Sure fire way to get Greenough.

they emailed it out a couple days ago!

Where can you find the survey??

Hi! For sociability  what happens if you rate low? I like being with people but I like having my own space to recharge

I don’t think much else would, but it’s a way to get a certain type of roommate if you want one

I don’t know why the form is so detailed and the “matchups” were anything but. People can be really gross. The things I’ve seen. I truly envied those singles in Canaday….

Which of the buildings at Harvard will not be the target of denaming?

The denaming email says the following is grounds for denaming:



>the perception that a namesake’s actions or beliefs were ‘abhorrent’ in the context of current values



What I think we are going to find is that virtually all White men of WASP heritage, for whom I'd assume most buildings at Harvard are named, were one or more of the following: racist, misogynist, anti-semitic, homophobic, ableist, classist, and anti-atheist. I seem to doubt that the views of, say Henry Dunster (President of Harvard from 1640-1654) would be tolerable in the areas of racial justice or women's rights.



I feel like this is going to turn into a circus. And nobody at Harvard actually believes that the ideals of Increase Mather are inculcated at Mather Steins. 

You would think and yet they put up giant buildings without a name, “Northwest Building.”

It’s “North West Building”. Kanye donated and named it after his daughter.

Only because they haven't found someone who will pay up high enough.





(*=barring rescinding such naming later...)



You mean fundraising opportunity.



Every building that has a name stripped is a new opportunity to ~~sell naming rights~~ honor those who have donated generously to ~~Harvard~~ advancing humankind.

We may as well, everyone needs a laugh these days.

If any house needs to be re-named, former president Leonard Hoar still is waiting for this honor.

Or Lord, this will really wake people up



- Lord of This World Pavillion

- Center for Iron Man

- Paranoid House

- Hand of Doom Theater

- After Forever Hall

- Sleeping Village Village

- Snowblind School of Applied Sciences

Probably the Barker Center. I’m told it is named for a dog.

Lol I'm sure a White guy born in 1607 is gonna have nothing "abhorrent" on his record...

this university was literary founded as an attempt to "civilize" the native population. People like Winthrop contributed to the first English genocides of native Americans in North America. There is only so much you can do to reconcile with that.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but I do believe projecting our morals to the past doesn't accomplish much and keeps us from looking at ourselves. e.g., our grandkids will probably want us burned because we allowed the uyghur genocide to continue and knew full well children were digging in cobalt mines so we could have our new iPhones.

But John Harvard is cool, right?

> Eugenics is not j being a little problematic



Margaret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood.

… have you ever heard of Agassiz or what he did? Eugenics is not j being a little problematic. That’s what I’d assume they’re talking about

Harvard is woke!

What an exhausting and useless effort to apply today’s zeitgeist to past eras.

>The fun part will be in 100 years when people today are judged by some future evolution of our social mores... and it's determined we ought to rename everything again.



Try 30 years. Many jokes that were fine in the 80s are intolerable now.



>And I fully anticipate an upcoming controversy involving the Kennedy family when it comes to renaming, lmao.



This whole thing will depend on what "abhorrent" means to people. But for an *infinitum ad absurdum,* we should just go east to west, north to south across the yard, and rename every building Y-n. Robinson will be building Y1 and Lehman will be Y27.



I don't mean to erase the lived experiences of those whose identity groups were harmed by the actions of these dudes, but as someone with heritage from groups that would have been barred from Harvard or seen as inferior on both sides of my family, the University would better spend its time and energies addressing the harm that various forms of discrimination continue to cause around Boston, the US, and the world. Every minute we spend arguing over how racist or sexist Annenberg was is a minute not spend addressing one of the many forms of discrimination that blights our society. Renaming a House will not improve life for anyone who is not affiliated with Harvard. The wrongly incarcerated in Arkansas don't care if we rename Dunster in Cambridge.



>renaming seems like an easy "middle-ground" distraction.... an appearance of change without any actual change



Wait till you find out that the same people who are warning of an end to privacy and rights for the marginalized believe denaming is the way to go.



I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if Agassiz gets axed, but Farlow nearby is probably safe. I don’t know though- I think that this might be a futile effort as a lot of others have said.

Emerson?

They won’t be changing Sackler, I’ll bet, though they absolutely should

I thought Harvard of all places would be immune to this kind of horseshit but I guess not.



RIP.

I’ve always been surprised that people are so attached to building names. If the names change to reflect the current society’s ideals, then they change. Perhaps it’ll make Harvard more careful about who they chose to name buildings after in the future. I don’t think that’s a bad thing.

100 years, 30 years? Try today, tomorrow, next week.. Society is in a constant battle to establish who we collectively pay tribute to. As culture changes we toss out the old gods for those that are more reflective of the current moment. It is most jarring to people who are insulated from or are resisting the cultural shift. It’s reasonable to feel upset by change, but unrealistic to expect that the idols who mattered centuries ago are still relevant today and will remain relevant in perpetuity. If enough people don’t find meaning in Increase Mather…he just doesn’t matter anymore. I have no idea who my ancestors named the communal hut after in the year 800, but I’m ok that at some point that honorarium was discontinued for a new historical figurehead.

It’s “North West Building”. Kanye donated and named it after his daughter.

Best FOP Trip Trips

Hi guys, I'm an incoming freshman who is thinking about doing a FOP trip. The problem is that I don't really know whether to do a backpacking or switch trip. It seems that a switch trip would be slightly easier (physically speaking) since canoeing is probably easier than hiking with a heavy backpack and you do that for half of the time. However, I'm sure there are downsides to canoeing for part (i.e. getting wet, lack of shade, etc.) To anyone who did one of these types, what was your experience? And which would you recommend? 





Also, what is the bathing situation like? showers? rivers with soap? rivers *without* soap? Not deal breakers, but I would rather be prepared so that I'm not blind sighted. Thanks!

I would not find either to be easier than the other. Canoeing can be very physically taxing on the upper body if you're not used to it. Instead focus on your personal preferences. If you like canoeing and feel comfortable doing it, then definitely go. There's others who might not feel comfortable or just prefer to walk to the whole trip. Both are a greag introduction to the outdoors and the club here at Harvard and you'll definitely get a chance to repeat it if you want. Otherwise, expect something very close to primitive camping. Not sure if rivers are allowed to be used for bathing though.

They have various options for the difficulty of the trips (A, B, or C) that you can choose from, but I don’t think the switch trip is any easier than a backpacking trip. Backpacking was difficult, but you got used to it (and the packs lightened) over time. There is no bathroom, basically, but it was surprisingly fine. There’s a trowel and a single roll of TP for the whole group, usually. There’s no bathing so you get very stinky by the end, but you also get used to your and everyone else’s stink!

Rock music club/bands





Thanks :)

The music clubs tend towards orchestral/symphonic/glee/choral/TAPS. Hope you find the jelly for your jam, but you might have to be self-organizing and create what you want to see in the world.

questions about gender inclusive housing

this doesn't really answer your question about who lives in gender inclusive housing, but: your housing community will be only one of many communities you'll join when you start school, so you'll have other opportunities to engage with other people.  the dorm is also the place you'll come back to after long days, so perhaps its best to just choose where you think you'll feel most comfortable, and then let classes, clubs, etc. be the place to go further afield. 



and anyway, even if most people in inclusive housing *are* queer, there'll be other ways they'll likely take you out of your comfort zone--such is dorm living!

No, assuming you are attending a US HS.









Very cool, Jumbo Jerry.

Thank you, Rabbitary.

I haven’t the slightest idea of how to interpret this, could you elaborate?

No problem. I've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It's just common sense.

But have you really been far even as decided, to use even go want to do look more like?

Because of the showers in Harvard. People want there private showers to clean their legs from touching the dirty shower floor with their slippers

I have vague memories of grass, halcyon days before everything was lit by florescents and ticks weren't omnipresent. Sunlight feels expensive.

One time, I went to a physics conference and I told the person next to me, "If I don't make it here, I'm moving somewhere tropical and becoming a snorkeling guide." Then, the next time I went on a tropical snorkeling trip, I spoke to the tour guide. He earned a PhD in some kind of marine biology thing, and now spends his days ripping off tourists, getting tanned, and counting starfish for a nearby research lab. We should all strive to be like starfish-counter PhD guy.

Pre-Orientation Application

Hi, I'm an incoming freshman and was wondering how applications to FOP and FAP work? The website says no experience in outdoor activities/arts needed, but then what would be the criteria of how students are selected? What does the app generally look like? (essays, recs, etc.?)



Thank you!

There's size constraints honestly, I'd be willing to bet it was just full rather than you didn't make the cut. Others are open for as many as possible though

I didn't make the cut, and there was a cut because it was full.



If they made space for everyone who wanted to apply, this wouldn't be an issue. Other colleges don't have this problem.

Ah, I had meant cut as in rejected cause they didn't like your app, but that make sense. Honestly I criticize this place as much as anyone else but these programs are dependent on student leaders and it's hard to fit hundreds of prefrosh into them. I'd be surprised if other colleges don't have the same issues.

I don't remember ever having to literally apply, it's just an application of intent. You go to whichever program you want.

Has there been any updates on email addresses for Alumni?

[https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/6/12/alumni-email-address/](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/6/12/alumni-email-address/)







I concur, that tone seems to change quite a bit when they start asking for $ from their alumni. Something to consider the next time they are panhandling for donations via phone calls/letters/events.

did some digging for this as part of my work for HGC, basically, the TLDR from what we found is that any progress will be kind of stalled because they don't have a permenant body at the CIO office which was leading up the task force. seems unlikely in the near future if i had to guess

I’m not holding out much hope for this one

Was just about to ask this exact question. I hope they do something.

Housing lottery

Hi 







Thank you so much 



BW,



The housing staff told me that while other HUH buildings have ~50% turnover in a given year, Trilogy only has about ~30%. I highly recommend you monitor the availability in the days leading up to your window and be ready to select as soon as your window opens. Most folks I know who got lucky had windows within the first 2 weeks but YMMV. Typically, studios and 1 bedrooms are more readily available than 2 bedrooms. Again, if you can join an existing lease, that's a safer bet. Also, if you are at HSPH, see if Shattuck has any availability.

I got a similar view and select window and would also appreciate an answer to this question!

Facebook groups

My understanding is that Trilogy is difficult through the lottery. The easier way in is to find someone who already lives in Trilogy who is trying to replace a roommate.

Could you kindly check and see if there are any Soldiers Field Park 2 beds left? Thanks! My view window is next week...

Before the select window this morning, there were 19 2 beds at SFP. 



When I was in my view window I was able to download a daily inventory list pdf. I’m not sure, but it might be available on the top right corner of your screen when you’re on the lottery site. (I hadn’t noticed it until my window opened, but it might have always been there).

 Thanks so much for your help! Now I find the inventory list too. Hope there are still some left by the end of next week...

I’m in my view window right now. Looks like there are 13 studios, 9 suites, 4 1 beds and 8 2 beds left in Trilogy. Not sure how many go each round, but good luck!



If you do end up having to look for other places, I had a good experience living in Copley managed buildings in Fenway (though it’s a very different type of apartment).

One apartment left for trilogy at this moment.

The worst are the ones that worm into your DMs like girls you went to high school with who now sell essential oils.



“I just want to connect with fellow graduates! Hey girl! By the way, my grandma almost died this year and her dream is to see me graduate! Can you boot your own parents to make it happen?”

Two with the possibility of a third one if there are enough to go around for HES students. Not sure about the other schools.

Future student, how many tickets do y’all get per student? Just curious.

Agreed. It’s extremely annoying, unproductive and selfish.

Not to mention this sub is not meant to serve as a classified ad or Craigslist replacement.

In most instances in schools abroad, the IB scores form a part, or all, of your final grade. In that instance, the school sent predicted scores for application consideration, and submission if your actual results would be required.

Yeah the special student status I what I meant dude. “…with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher”

Yes! Any Harvard student can take classes at any other Harvard school for credit toward the degree (with the exception of extension students and extension classes). https://gsas.harvard.edu/registration/cross-registration

It’s unique to the program you’re in but a lot of them do allow it

Yes, in my experience it was very easy to. I took elective courses at HLS and HDS. Some of my classmates took MIT classes.

See you next fall!!!! - Incoming Harvard Law student

If anyone has housing advice or advice on anything, please let me know!!!!

I’m thinking the same but not sure what one - any thoughts on what you are leaning towards ?

Congrats! Looking forward to being your classmate. I’m going to live in the dorms as a 1L to since it’s decently affordable and is super convenient.

I'm gonna be in a Gropius standard I think. There are 4 Gropius buildings, and only 2 have washing machines. I don't have the housing sheet w me but I'd definitely live in the dorms w washing machines rather than not

Current HLS student, If you can do not live in Gropius. The savings are not worth it
