**Admitted students:** First of all, congratulations on all your hard work! Now you get to have the happiest of worries on which great institution to call your alma mater :) Post all your questions and comments here. This includes questions about undergrad and grad school admissions alike. We hope to welcome you to the Yale community but also feel free to ask us why it might not necessarily be the best choice for you. Individual posts outside of this megathread are subject to removal.

**Students and alumni**: Let's try our best to give constructive, specific feedback to all prospective Yalies and refrain from comments that would discourage them in any way.

For current students who have gone through the financial aid review process: about how long does it take and how can I increase my chances of success? I'm in a somewhat complicated financial situation where my parents filed taxes jointly in 2020 but divorced last year, so my parents can't afford to pay as much as the 2020 return would suggest. 

What’s the entrepreneurial ecosystem like at Yale?

Am I right in thinking that after Directed Studies, I'll have fulfilled 6 out of 14 of the courses needed for a Humanities Major?

Depends on the majors tbh. I know some people who double majored because they had many overlapping classes between the majors and it made sense to. I wanted to double major but the two majors had nothing in common so it wasn’t feasible to do both, now I just take classes in the one field for fun. A lot of people complete their study abroad in the summer, where it doesn’t compete with their semester classes, so that should be doable (unless double majoring requires that you take lots of summer credits at Yale to meet all the major requirements).

What’s it like double majoring at yale? is it worth it, is it too much work? do you regret double majoring at all? and can i still study abroad with a double major?

Any other incoming graduate students want to make a group chat?

What are Yale's PhD application process like for Archaeology?  I'm a junior in an IT program at a small school in NJ, but I have taken lots of anthro/archy classes.  Only I did bad on most of them because As scared me (don't worry, I talk to a professional every week about this).  But now I have a 4.0 in my new major and my new school.  Also, is it true that you can specialize in Warfare Archaeology as a PhD archaeology student at Yale?

Any Econ majors here? Tobin scholars?

thank you :)

Can anyone help me find the First Year Housing and Advising Form? I've looked everywhere on YaleConnect/App Portal/Yale College website and can't find it.

Hi, I might be transferring there in the Fall and have some questions:

• EP&E or Econ and why? I like EP&E but I want to double major and it might be easier to graduate on time with Econ since it’s less classes

• Thoughts on the Camp Yale Programs? I think I might enroll in one but trying to decide which one

• How accessible are sports for non-pros? I want to play golf and a few other things but am barely learning

Heyyo! My name is Josh and I am here at Yale for a summer research program.  I was wondering if anyone know anything about summer intramural teams for volleyballs, or if anyone knows a group of people that just plays for fun in the afternoon's :))

Global Affairs Major Class Selection

Hey everyone! I'm an incoming freshman to Yale College, and I've been planning my classes for the fall/spring and had a few questions. I want to major in Global Affairs, so I have to take Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Applied Quantitative Analysis 1, Applied Quantitative Analysis II, Approaches to International Security, and Approaches to International Development.

&#x200B;

I know I have to apply for my major since it's limited access, and it's quite competitive, so I want to take the right classes to have the best chance of being accepted into my major. I was wondering what the best courses to take each semester would be? For the fall I was thinking about taking: Propaganda, Ideology, and Democracy, Origins of U.S. Global Power, Gateway to Global Affairs, and my freshman seminar. Would it be wise to swap out one of them for Applied Quantitative Analysis 1? I'm bad at math so I don't want to overwork myself the first semester, but Applied Quantitative Analysis 1 isn't available in the spring.

&#x200B;

When do you recommend I begin my language? I want to improve my Spanish skills and learn Mandarin, but I don't know if I'll have enough time for that. I'm also interested in applying to be a human rights scholar, so what classes do you recommend I take to have a good chance at being accepted for that?

I’d say for your first year, try to keep an open mind and don’t overcommit to the major. Most people take the intro econ sequence their first year and then take AQA I in their sophomore fall.

If you’re starting a language at L1, you should start now as you have to reach L5 for Global Affairs. If you’re starting from L3, you can wait a bit more.

Residential College System Questions

I'm a prospective student looking at Yale, and I have some questions about the Res College system. 

Questions for Course Selection as an Incoming Freshman

Hello! I'm an incoming freshman who's hoping to have a few questions about their course selection answered :D I've been playing around a little with coursetable since it recently opened for incoming people, and I have a few (albeit detailed) concerns about which courses I should pick.

2. Is 15 minutes... a "reasonable" amount of time to get to another class? I have these two classes that I'm really hoping to take (one of which being korean^), but I'm not sure if I'm being ballsy trying to get to another class in 15 minutes. Not to mention risking being late but also downtime from attending another class. Though I'm accustomed to only having 5 minutes to prepare before another class from high school, I'm not sure if this changes in college.

3. Is 2 distributional/major credit classes and 2 purely-for-fun classes reasonable for the first semester? Though I am trying my best to pick classes that I know I will enjoy, I know there are some classes that I'll have to take to fulfill credit requirements. Not sure if I should be focusing on fulfilling distributional/major credits this early since I haven't decided on a major yet (looking at... ~5 options + ik I won't decide until at least after freshman year) and distributional credits seem pretty easy to fulfill, but I also don't want to be a frantic junior later trying to graduate with the major I want on time. Any advice on how to approach course selection as a freshman and potentially beyond?

Wait so instead of the shopping period, is there another way to sit in on classes that we're interested in?

1. I have no idea about Korean, but Italian classes are scattered everywhere, so that might extend to Korean.

3. Yeah, that's a decent distribution of stuff. If you had a pretty intense major I might recommend 3, but you should be fine (keep in mind that your "fun" classes should still fill SC/SS/HU requirements, which is good. If you know you'll probably major in a specific broad area, try looking for fun classes that fall outside of that so you can get those distributionals)

4. Only that you must have 2 classes that are WR, QR, or Language, although definitely try to do a first year seminar.

Wait so instead of the shopping period, is there another way to sit in on classes that we're interested in?

Everyone *seems* homeschooled, if that helps.

Career Plans of Physics Majors @ Yale?

Fellow Physics majors, what are you guys' career prospects after undergrad/postgrad. Do you guys wish to remain in academia and seek faculty positions in colleges or go find industry work elsewhere?

Most physics undergrads in my year started at PhD programs immediately after graduation.

Some took a short gap year in industry before starting a PhD program.

Several others went into software engineering or quant roles in industry, but this was a less common path than continuing to graduate school.

Jobs with Living Wage?

Math 244 or CPSC 202?

from the post it sounds like you should definitely take 244 if you want to take the class that you'll learn the most from. 202 is really basic/easy and should be taken if you don't have any math background or don't care for sophistication and want to get on with the degree requirements.

what should i bring to fsy?

What does this mean? (BA prerequisites)

"The prerequisites for acceptance into the major are a sophomore review, which is an intensive advising session and evaluation of work from studio courses taken at the Yale School of Art, and five introductory courses"

Does this mean that I have to apply to Yale as another major, and start the BA program in my 3rd year after doing the sophomore review in my sophomore year, resulting in 6 years of study for 1 major? Or something else entirely?

You are accepted to Yale without a declared major, and you are expected to declare during your sophomore year. Then, you apply to the art major and, if accepted, you finish your remaining years as an art major. The whole thing (pre + post declaring) takes 4 years

fin aid questions

can someone explain to me what the student share portion of the financial aid is? is it an amount that I need to pay the school or no?

Running at Yale

I keep running away from my responsibilities all the time

yale housing/meal plan??

okay so im so confused right now because when i try to look up how much dorms are gonna be they give me the annual amount. so my question is, do i pay monthly or all at once? and if it is monthly do i divide it by 12 months ($875) or 9 months ($1166). 

It all gets added with tuition into a single bill charged to your account that you can gradually pay. 

If you move off campus, you can opt out of a meal plan, but usually there's a rule that all first and second year students have to live on campus.

The other person who answered is correct, you pay everything in one bill at the start of each semester. The only thing to add is that if you want to pay gradually over the semester you have to sign up for the payment plan well in advance, otherwise you have to pay in full at the start of the semester.

Do you have to send in all your SAT scores when applying to Yale?

Or has that changed?

June 24th I believe. I got an email abt this

wait what does this mean im very confused

If you’ve committed to Yale, you need to send in official scores through college board. The deadline to do this is June 24th according to the email I got if my memory serves me right

This is if you have applied and gotten in already? Like the last admissions cycle?

Yale is test-optional for this coming cycle but you can self-report scores on your application if you want to. If you are accepted and choose to enroll you will have to submit official scores.

I used score choice when I sent it, is that a problem?

Taking less than 4 credits?

I’m an incoming junior transfer and have some concerns about adjusting academically as well as socially to Yale. I am currently looking at signing up for 3.5 credits this fall. Will this require permission from a dean? I’m really trying to spend my first semester making sure I can adjust as best I can

You can try enrolling in 4.5 then drop

You will probably have to talk to your College Dean — they will tell you that you cannot drop any credits if you want to remain enrolled full time. But you can usually get approval for a 3.5 credit load.

I think just less than 3.5 credits needs dean approval

Downtown Housing?

which course is easier? my math skills are pretty weak so trying to figure out which the lesser evil is

Biochemistry (MB&B 300/301)

For any STEM people at Yale, I was wondering how much organic chemistry knowledge is required in the Principles of Biochemistry I class, MB&B 300. I am thinking about going abroad my Junior Fall, and I would have to take CHEM 220 and MB&B 300 concurrently to have a shot at completing MB&B as my major. Any advice?

Here are the chemistry-related topics that I can recall from the sequence: 

* Why pH can affect the charge of a protein due to protonation/deprotonation

* pKa

Congratulations of Graduating!! I was planning on taking MB&B 300/301 as a sophomore, and then the physics sequence as a Junior. However, i am also considering taking PHYS 180/181 as a sophomore and then biochem as a junior. Both paths don't sound great, though.

I did physics/orgo as a sophomore and the biochem sequence junior year (didn’t do first year orgo). Worked out fine for me! It’s nice to finish the major classes early, but I’m not sure if it’s worth struggling through biochem without orgo first. If you do biochem as a junior it still gives you plenty of time to take other classes senior year — all I did in my spring semester related to my major was the MB&B thesis, and took a bunch of other random classes.

Prefrosh here. Throwaway account. Primarily because of some mental health issues that I am now receiving treatment for, my grades in 2nd semester of ~~high school~~ senior year were uncharacteristically low. I'm a STEM major (as you can probably tell):

AP Social Studies Course: B+

AP Social Studies Course: B

Theology Course: C-

English Course: D+

I am extremely worried that Yale will rescind me. How do my prospects look? And is there anything I can do or say that would help me at this point?

I don't think Yale is yet aware of my situation—I have not yet sent my final transcript. Thank you for the response though. I'm thinking about how best to approach an admissions officer with this news.

I don't know your situation, so please don't take what I'm about to say as an imperative, but have you considered whether you're feeling up to heading straight to Yale? I don't know the deferral policy, but I think admissions would look favorably on the idea that you wanted to take some time to address the things that became a serious problem for you this spring. Better that than having a similarly difficult first semester at college, or worse, having to leave mid-semester on medical leave, and having to go through the nightmarish readmission process.

Did your roommate face any consequences for the decline in his academic performance other than having to write that letter?   I personally have full confidence in my ability to put this behind me and succeed at Yale, but I need admissions to share that confidence. One of my concerns is that mental health issues are just not a good enough excuse—I should have just powered through.

[deleted]

He ended up being my sophomore roommate, so no. :)

He wrote about some social issues that came up and how that impacted him, but also how he planned to push through them in college.

I got in early but then was in a similar position after they got my first trimester grades for senior year. I got a B and a C in two classes I normally would have done well in if I wasn’t sick and having mental health issues. I ended up getting a very scarily worded (and weirdly enough, typo-filled?) email from my admissions officer saying this is an issue and that I needed to explain what happened. They were very receptive to my explanation and it never affected me again. Though it ended up being fine in the end for me, it was a really scary email to wake up to, and I was legitimately worried they were going to rescind me. 

The admissions department has a lot of room to work with students if they can see that you care about what is going on. If they come to you it might look like you are trying to skate by without anyone noticing and they therefore might be less inclined to help you. 

Second, try to register with the accessibility department ASAP so that you have another department at Yale that can confirm your struggles to the admissions officer. Not only will it show that you care but it will demonstrate that you are trying to prevent this situation from repeating.

Are you talking about UC Berkeley or Berkeley College at Yale?

Did anyone here take more than 4.5 credits first semester?

However, it worked out *only* because most of the courses covered material I was already familiar with from prior studies, so overall my coursework wasn’t a huge challenge. Also, one of my courses I took credit-D to further lighten my load.

I’ll caution that I had experience with college courses before starting at Yale and found Yale’s classes to be significantly harder. Obviously this will depend on different majors etc, but there’s not a major disadvantage to taking a lighter first semester and then doing a more rigorous one second.

I did 5.5. Not worth it unless you have a game plan (e.g. completely unrelated double major) in mind

the only person I knew who did more was someone taking piano lessons for credit, and she was a piano prodigy so that didn’t really count (she didn’t have to put much time into it). I found 3.5 to be really nice first semester, definitely would not have been able to do 5 (did 5.5 last semester as a junior and it was exhausting). 4 or 4.5 is the best course load, especially as a first year!

Anyone going to EZoo 2022?

&#x200B;

Yes I am Friday and Sunday. Pm me

It is one of the easiest majors at yale. I thought this was well known. I would say if you really want to get something out of your yale education just major in econ instead

As an art major, I still have one more science class to fulfill my undergrad distributional requirement. Not looking for an easy pass, but was wondering if there are any less intimidating classes for non-STEM student

Do you know any course numbers?

Yeah that one. I got kicked out. I wish they would offer like a WWII or English class that’s for stem only to make things fair, but 🤷🏾‍♂️

MS Comp Sci vs Full Time

I just finished bachelor's degrees in Comp Sci and Statistics from a T5-T10 public university in 3 yrs. 

I have the opportunity to complete an MS in Comp Sci at Yale, fully funded with a 24K annual stipend for 2 yrs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-----

FWIW many of my friends did the joint BS+MS ([link](https://dus.cs.yale.edu/bs+ms.html)) in computer science, those who did the MS have pretty much identical career paths and compensations so far (3-4 years out of graduation) as those who did not. If you think you'd like the program, go for it! But if you're doing it only for future job prospects I'd reconsider.

I am an Yale College alum currently working as a Staff Software Engineer—if it were me, I would do the MS. It will enable you to avoid working on “solved” problems (eg glue code) when you do get on the market and you’ll also be able to command a higher salary.

mid-orientation program for transfers?

i'm an incoming sophomore transfer (but i took a gap year so i'm currently 20) thinking about the mid-orientation programs. i know that FOCUS has a transfer-specific program, but do the other programs put transfers in groups with only first years? i'm interested in FOOT but idk how i feel about being 20 in a group with 18-year-olds trying to make friends with other 18-year-olds (especially bc the social aspect is supposed to be a big draw). has anyone done foot and had a transfer student in their group?

my year had a lot of freshman come in having taken a gap year, so we ranged from 17-20, and it wasn't weird at all.

Agreed. Because of internationals and gap years, my first year peers were 17 to 21. 20 is not that bad.

I’m a prospective student, who will be going to Yale in the coming fall, I found a Yale website saying how Yale offers Adobe Creative Cloud for free for students but it’s a few years old. Do they still offer this? When I try it says “access denied please contact admin”, is it possibly because I’m a prospective student?

Undergrad degree

Hi! I've just found out that you can't apply for a Yale undergraduate degree if you already hold a undergrad degree from a different uni. I'm currently doing an undergrad in Australia and been wanting to apply to Yale for a different degree once I've finished this one. 

I'm just wondering what the reason is for this? 

Thanks :))

ohh ok that makes sense. thanks :))

Try grad school?

Oh i didn’t know about that, interesting

This is literally every college. You’re not allowed to get two bachelors. Good news is you can still apply for grad school if you want to attend Yale

ohh ok that makes sense. thanks :))

Boxing at Yale

I heard the debate club often turns into a boxing match when verbal arguments are not convincing enough.

Gymnastics at Yale

I was wondering - are there any male/co-ed recreational gymnastics options at Yale? It's one of my favorite activities and want to keep at it when coming next year

Oh, driving might be an issue; I'm an international student so I have no clue how my day-to-day would look like. Thanks for the response!

Elon Musk recently tweeted that Yale is ["the epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization".](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526975113597489154?s=21&t=KrZZY9r8k_qHVh1ybeoRqw) As Yale students, how true is this? I don't mind the downvotes this post will get.

Ask again and you go to jail not yale.

Also fuck musk.

The YPU is only dominated by conservative parties because they are better at politics.  The vast majority of undergraduates are very liberal.  Yale's Young College Democrats outnumber the Young College Republicans by at least 20:1.

Honestly I think the wokeness is severely overplayed. Ted Cruz came to campus and the worst thing that happened is someone asked if he would suck a cock. I can think of at least 10 campuses across the US where such an event would probably result in physical altercations.

Yale has a *very* active conservative contingent on campus, the YPU is dominated by conservative parties, etc. Yale does not even have an active *explicitly* communist group (there are certainly left to far-left groups, and there are communists on campus, but I am not aware of any group that is explicitly communist in nature).

Lots of college students do dopey political shit in every school in the country. When it happens at Yale it's front page news. 

Elon Musk is a vampire in skinny jeans

Musk is a clueless dolt who is masking his own personal BS and inadequate political compass. This view of Yale is no more than a shallow media trope willfully spread to garner views and stoke moral outrage.

tru

almost all examples of yale being woke in this comment section are not anywhere near what yale students actually want. if you want to die on the hill of yalies being carriers of the woke virus, at least find good examples. the halloween altercation could have happened in brooklyn in the 90s; its only now that there is enough conviction and desire for change among undergraduate community that the incident happens.

Also fuck musk.

I do not mind many roommates, small rooms, religious organizations, sharing apartment with elderly, whatever it takes. We get a small stipend, but with health insurance for international students and moving, we don't have that much money left. 

I would recommend joining the Facebook group “Yale Grad Free & For Sale & Rent.” Lots of grad students post there looking for roommates.

What’s foot?

I want to get involved in Greek life on campus possibly. My brother was in Sig Ep at FSU so he's been trying to help me research but it's been pretty difficult finding information about how to rush and fraternities at Yale. I was interested in Alpha Delta Phi or Sigma Chi possibly? But honestly, any frat would be great I think. Any and all info would be appreciated :)

Yale frats have spring rush for freshmen so you wouldn’t be rushing first semester. If you go out during your first semester you’ll get a feel for the different frats here. For example, Sigma Chi is the “Asian frat” and AEPi is a “Jewish frat.” We also have some social clubs like Edon which is basically Sig Ep

Also, check with your Dean but I thought foreign language had to be completed before the end of your junior year so you might have to get permission to finish it during your senior year.

Any Drawbacks to the FSY program?

Yeah I think the worst thing was missing out on that summer with my high school friends, now that we’re in college every summer we have internships taking us all over the US. And losing out on that summer income was not fun, but as someone who worked all throughout high school I found it a relief (and we got more refund money from Yale that fall bc of missing out on that income).

How hard is it to Walk-on for football?

I come from a small school without a football team, so I might be naive when it comes to the difficulty of being selected for a football team, but is it possible to walk-on for Yale Football without previous experience? I played Varsity level D1 sports in high school, specifically basketball, and I am 6’6” 290 lbs and lift. I obviously wouldn’t start or anything, but I’d like the community and staying fit. I’m attending this fall. Thanks.

It's unlikely, but your best bet is to reach out to the coach directly.  They may have a "try-out" process available.   But a varsity commitment is like taking on a full-time job on top of everything else.

Judging by your football helmet avatar, I assume that you played football at Yale, if not another college. Do practices take up all 20 hours that are allowed by the NCAA? What would the tryout process look like? Should I just email the coach? Is there any possibility of me being able to travel and compete with the team, even if I’m just the third string backup?

Played in undergrad (not at Yale). Affiliated though grad school at Yale.

You’ll likely be maxing out NCAA accountable hours (20 in season + spring ball and 10 in off-season), so it’s still a big time commitment.

 Was talking to my brother at Yale the other day and he told me that a lot of celeb kids go there. Is it really true that children/relatives of A-list celebrities/TV personalities etc are currently at Ivies/T10s but current students are supposed to be lowkey about them?

Why is this a thread every single time new Yalies are admitted. Who cares and Chill out.

Because I am a junior and I want to apply there the next cycle

Hi Hot Mess Throwaway 7! Why do you care?

Which students go there?

people who’ve been in fys, i was wondering would i have enough time to go visit home on weekends? i’m a two hour drive away, but i’m not sure how busy they’d be keeping fys students.

trying to decide if it is worth the 7 weeks

Here's a thread with much of the details discussed

If you don’t mind me asking, why don’t you like ENG 114? Why would it be a wasted credit? I’m just asking because I’m considering the program

As an example, I really got my writing boot camp in a religious studies class about pluralism and philosophy. 

The program has been well built to support student's transition to Yale, so I think the question is whether you feel like you want that support (I also personally wwould not want to waste a credit on ENG 114, but that's a different convo).

What are some volunteering options for Yale kids?

I was just wondering if anyone knew of any volunteering options in New Haven? I feel like I hear of them through the grapevine but have no idea how to actual get started with joining/membership. Does anyone know more about some options?

Any e-scooter users on campus out there?

Is Portuguese still relatively an easy language class? The course table reviews are still really great, but sometimes I know that those can be a little outdated lol. Has anyone taken it recently that can comment on it?

what clothing brands are most common on campus?

[deleted]

Has anyone here done the First Year Scholars at Yale (FSY) program?

Hey, this may sound like a stupid question, but does Yale cover room and board too? Like did you have to pay for food or pay for a room?

[deleted]

Yeah, and most of the friend groups from my FSY cohort I still see hanging out together around campus! I was a more floaty person, but I’m still close with two of my FSY friends and I hang around a few others occasionally as well :)

this^

i don't think the class is that hard (at least my friends who did FSY describe doing very little work overall)

1. Rigor. I'm not sure how rigorous the courses will be, which scares me as I would rather not start off my Yale academic career with a less than stellar start. Also, I'm not great at math and it's been a while since I've done real math work, so I'm worried about diving right back into headfirst this summer. On the flip side, it'd obviously help with the transition into Yale. As a side note, I don't know what major or path I want to pursue, so picking the right classes would be tough.

2. Friends. I think that FSY would provide me with a great opportunity to adjust socially and make good friends at Yale, but I also have my friends back home. This is essentially the last time I get to hang out with them for an extended period of time before we all head our separate ways, and to spend my entire summer at Yale would break my heart. I've been looking forward to this summer where'd I be relatively stress-free where I'd spend a ton of time with my friends, and going to FSY would obviously cap that.

FSY is meant to prepare you for college courses, and the class that you do take is not meant to be super hard. The idea is to give you a slow introduction to Yale, and make sure you have some credits to fall back on, in case you need to drop a class during your first or second semester.

That's encouraging! I'm a bit worried about math bc I haven't really done math in over a year, so I'm not sure diving headfirst into a math course would be a great idea.

Spot - No idea how this works, but I’m sure other FSY participants in this thread can speak to it :)

You take a placement test to get placed into calc 1, 2, 3, or statistics

Just a few questions:

1.) What's your background in math? I personally struggle a bit with math and it's been a while since I've done any, so I'm worried about going to FSY and struggling with it. Keep in mind I'm not sure what I want to major in and that I virtually have 0 experience with calc. Do you think I'll be able to keep up? Also, I'm not familiar with research papers. Did you mean 8 pages single spaced, 1.15 spaced, or double spaced?

Hey I had a question. For FSY, do you stay at the Yale campus the entire length of the program or how does that work? Like can you leave on days you don’t have any schedule events?

1) I personally have a strong background in math and calc, but there's a placement test to sort into 3 levels of math. If it's the same as when I went, it's Statistics, Intro to Calc I, and Intro to Calc II. The math course was only half a credit, so it was pretty much just two lectures and a problem set a week then a final. There are sessions with ULAs (tutors for the course) every week to go over the problem set material, and you can work in groups on the problems, so you can reach out to your friends if you don't understand something.

You'll need 36 normal credits to graduate (as in, just make sure you get 4.5 courses a semester), but you'll need some of those to be "writing" courses, some to be "quantitative reasoning," etc. 

Here's a breakdown: 

WR:  Writing courses. These are usually assigned on the basis of whether a course will make you write about 20 pages of material, so they can be in any subject. Most students need 2 WR credits to graduate. FSY has English 114, which will give you your first. I did my second in a history class junior year. These are often seminars, so they can be hard to get into and you want to make sure you like the subject. ("Seminar" meaning the class size will be limited to like 20 people whereas a lecture can have 300)

L: Language. There are specific intro language courses to take so you'll know them. Most people need 3 semesters of one, but if you place into a high level at the start then it's fewer. These classes are a pain and a half because they meet 5 days a week and have daily homework and class participation. Needs to be completed by the end of your junior year. You can take an online placement test before the start of the semester if you want to start at an intermediate level in a language, or you can start learning an entirely new language at L1. 

Sc: Qualifies as a science class 

Soc: Qualifies as a social science class 

Hu: Qualifies as an arts & humanities class. 

I know a few kids went to NYC over weekends, and I stayed in an AirBnB with someone for a few days. 

Is there a final for any math class that you would choose? Is there also a final for English, or is there just a final paper? (This is pertaining to FSY’s courses)

Oh also, are we able to select which English class we want to attend? If so, is there a limit to each class? Or are we randomly assigned?

My year was a problem set every week, a final in math, and three papers to write, at like 5, 6, and 8 pages.

FSY starts in like late June and ends a few weeks before school (unless you also want to join a Camp Yale program, which is advisable), so you'll still have like a month of summer to goof around with your friends. I remember having like a week of sleepovers with my buddies to get 100% completion on Spider-Man PS4 before I left.  

For example, in my year there were 6 classes taught by 6 professors. I opted for one that was about narrative structures, so we'd have to read excerpts about narrative elements and wrote an essay over the movie Memento. Other classes were about like, American agriculture and food deserts or immigration. There's a wide variety

You rank your top three (or that’s what happened in 2019) and most people I knew got their top choice (or second)

Would you say it’s totally doable to get an A in both classes as long as you attend office hours and get the help you need?

I understand. Last question, do you stay in the regular dorms while you’re there and how does that work? Like how extensively do we need to pack?

You'll probably go into the Intro to Calc I course, which shouldn't require any prior experience with it

Nobody has any prior experience with stats, but it's supposedly the "gut" math course (the one you take if you really need a math credit but you hate math)

You stay in the regular dorms. In my year, we all had rooms in Ezra Stiles. Generally there will also be summer session srudents on campus. 

I recall the course being almost entirely focused on summation series and Taylor approximations

Intro Calc I would probably be the best if you plan to take Calc I at all in your undergraduate career, but it is very much heavy on modeling word problems and such

This is entirely variable based on the year, but location could be a factor. In my year, the calc classes were in the Poorvu center of Sterling Library (a five minute walk from our dorms in Ezra Stiles), whereas the S&DS kids had class on Science Hill (~20-30 minute walk) and they hated that

I did FSY 2019

The classes are only stressful in that they'll be your first Yale courses. The curriculum is only 1.5 credits (compared to an average of 4--5 credits a semester). They also significantly shorten the workload (our final research paper was only like an 8 page requirement) because of the timeframe.

Intro Calc I would probably be the best if you plan to take Calc I at all in your undergraduate career, but it is very much heavy on modeling word problems and such

This is entirely variable based on the year, but location could be a factor. In my year, the calc classes were in the Poorvu center of Sterling Library (a five minute walk from our dorms in Ezra Stiles), whereas the S&DS kids had class on Science Hill (~20-30 minute walk) and they hated that

School of art mfa students! Which college or univ did you get the bachelor degrees from?

Hi:)

I’m an illustration major student from RISD (bfa) and I wish I could go to yale for mfa (either painting or gd). But wondering which school did yale students get ba or bfa before yale?

got it! thanks so much :)

MOPs

P.S: They aren't pre-orientation this year, they are mid-orientation!

AP Scores

Class of 26 and was wondering if Yale will rescind for 1s and 2s on ap tests?

I don’t think I even reported my senior year AP test scores.

No

I got 1s and 2s on all of my AP tests both junior and senior year of high school. I don't think Yale cared in the slightest.

Eli Whitney Program

Hello everyone! I'm a non-traditional student and finished my high-school in 2016 but didn't go to college because i was fighting a mental illness. 

I'm currently in medschool( here in Brazil you get  in directly and the course takes 6 years to complete) and just finish my first semester with 4.7 GPA( that puts me in top 1 of my class) and i also do voluntary work helping people that are fighting a similar problem than I did.

My question is: does my profile fits the one that Eli Whitney Program is looking for?

Ps: I didn't find the admission megathread, only the admitted one. Unfortunately that's not my case yet. If that's the wrong place do put my question, please show me the right one and I will delete the post.

intl student has a few questions

hi! im a dutch high school student planning to apply to yale next fall, but since i cant visit the campus and ask a few questions that i have i thought id ask them here :) some can probably only be answered by other international students but ill just list them all:

- can i get 7 hours of sleep every night and still stay on top of my schoolwork, extracurriculars and possibly a job? im probably gonna major in english or wgss and im planning to apply to the education studies program :)

* Yes but it depends on how much time you want to spend on your extracurriculars, how many courses you decide to take, how hard you party, etc.

* I have no advice there, I'm from the US

* As some straight white guy, note that these are just my observations, but: The Yale student body is very diverse, very accepting, and very, very LGBT. If someone addresses you incorrectly it's probably accidental and they'll have no problem with you correcting them. However, there will always be some small minority still stuck in the past; I have heard some... unwelcoming conversations between people who thought nobody was listening. For faculty I have no idea, my perspective again is limited.

* No clue, am domestic

Yale allows students who apply for EA to apply to other schools - *just not other private schools.* At least, this is how it was in 2020-2021. Check the website or email an admissions counselor. You will also know by early-mid December if you get accepted. Since many other private colleges in the U.S. have application deadlines in January/February or even later than that, you can still apply to many other places if you don't get accepted. What I would do is fill out all of the applications early since you like to get things taken care of, but don't submit them until you get your decision from Yale. Good luck.

some things i can answer, i’m not international so i won’t speak for international students:

the students are very accepting of they/them identities — yale is colloquially known as the “gay ivy,” which is really a catch-all for a very lgbtq+ inclined student body. as for the faculty, yes, most of them tend to be accepting. as in any university, you may find an asshole or two amongst some older stuck-in-their-ways professors, but especially if you’re a wgss major or even in edstudies you won’t have any issue.

Doing research at Yale over the summer, looking for friends

I'm 20M, studying Applied Math/Stats. I'm into math, guitar, olympic weightlifting (also curious about what gyms are nearby), filming/edits, drifting, history, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm decently outgoing and would be curious to find parties/etc. in New Haven too.

If you're here over the summer and we share any interests (or even none at all) definitely shoot me a PM! 

AP Research: 93

&#x200B;

I cannot raise these grades whatsoever... This is what I will have after I do all the extra credit possible. I'm a prospective neuro major admitted RD and I have had 2 Bs in the past in calculus. I also have a valid reason if they were to demand a letter explaining the 2 Cs. Will I get rescinded?

No

You are fine unless you fail a course

Pre-Recorded Interview

Are you serious? What’s going to happen when you have to do an actual interview for a job? Also, the StandOut interview is completely optional; you didn’t even have to do it.

How do y’all feel that Rodney Thomas II was drafted by the Colts?

Not a student, will probably never step foot on a Ivy League Campus, but I wonder how people at a Ivy League school feel about one of their own getting drafted

Ryan Fitzpatrick and Matt Berk (Future HOF) came from Harvard

Definitely more Ivy League grads than most think on the nfl. Kyle Juszxcych went to some school in Cambridge lol

I’m an alum and I’m happy for him. I didn’t know who he was, even though I do watch a good chunk of our games via ESPN+.

Yale alum Foyesade Oluokun lead the NFL in tackles last year. He was a 6th round pick in 2018. 

We had a guy, Miye Oni, drafted in the 2nd round of the NBA draft in 2019.

Not only is Yale credited with creating the first Hamburger, but it is affiliated with the first rage beat

do you regret going to yale?

What issues?

These are the biggest things I take issue with

this \^\^

I don’t think yale is perfect, it has a lot of issues, but honestly I don’t think I could ever regret my decision to attend here. It’s really a place where I feel at home, and I’m going to miss the faculty of my department when I graduate next year. Ahh I’m already dreading leaving, even as I’m excited for my future 🥲

Why?

No, I don't regret going to Yale. But I wonder if I would send my daughter here.

aw no! It’s okay it’ll get better :)

More often than I should. I wish I had had the courage to apply to schools that were better suited to what I wanted to pursue as a career. There was a lot of pressure from my family to go to an Ivy. While I do love the people here at Yale, there are very few classes I actually enjoy and I feel like I'm trudging towards my bachelor's until I can go to the school I really want post-grad. I feel however that my situation is a bit unique since I am an art student

What are you really asking here?

How Competitive is it to get into the Global Affairs Major?

I'm choosing between Princeton (planning to major in the School of Public and International Affairs) and Yale, where I'm planning to major in Global Affairs. I've recently discovered that admissions into the Global Affairs is "competitive." How competitive is it and is it possible for me not to get into the major (I listed it in first place when I applied)?

How are you feeling?

dying lmao

Taking a class for Credit

Is it frowned upon to take a class for credit? I want to take some classes that are relatively hard and aren’t necessary for my major without the stress of having to worry about the grade or anything, but I don’t know much about the credit/D/F option. If you get a D or an F, is it weighted into your GPA?

Just ask your DUS or registrar. But also, the answe to your question is that it is not frowned upon. If you take it pass/fail it is NOT weighed to gpa.

Use the Cr/D/F option to explore classes you wouldn't normally take, or ones that are generally more difficult or skew towards lower grades. As a STEM major I took a fascinating writing-heavy philosophy class, and I didn't have to stress over the papers. The option is there -- use it. Just don't get too lax and end up getting D/F, because that will hurt you.

What are your thoughts on Yale engineering

I like Yale a lot, but am a little concerned it may be dumb to pick Yale environmental engineering over Stanford. However, I don’t think I want to be an engineer, rather have the skills and engineering degree provides for future career options. Thoughts?

You learn the same physics at Yale as you do anywhere else, frequently out of the same textbook! You may as well spend 4 years somewhere you love rather than go somewhere “for the program”  

Don’t know what you mean by signaling

It was ages ago but the best times I had were with the YPMB.  It felt like we never won a football game but the routines were so much fun.  And we didn't practice as much as you'd think.

I was looking through my family History documents and I found relatives of mine who are Jewish.

I am currently in the process of converting to Judaism and would love to get into contact with my relatives.

I know very little about this branch of the family other than the name of someone who studied at Yale in the '90s. Is it possible that I could access this contact or no.

They are ehhhh. Wait times can be long. If you know you have a history of mental illness or mental health challenges, you should get signed up with 

the counseling office right away and do a preventative intake appointment. If you end up having an issue it’s much easier to get seen as an established patient rather than a new one

Anyone Subletting over the Summer?

Hey, I don't go here (I'm a student at Purdue), but I recently accepted an internship offer at Medtronic Surgical Robotics located in North Haven for the sunmer. My offer came really late, but I was wondering if anyone is interested in subletting their apartment (I would be in CT from May 23 to August 19). Thanks so much!

Try to join the Yale off campus or a New Haven apartment Facebook groups for subletting.

Yale Graduation is on the 23rd, so it might be rough to find an available apartment for then.

I'm an admitted student, and I have already created my NetID and my YaleConnect account; however, I don't seem to find the Housing and Advising Form anywhere. I already checked the MySurverys/Forms but it says there isn't anything to do. Where can I find this form, or will it take a bit longer to appear (I accepted my admission on April 9th)?

Chicago Roommate

Anyone looking for a roommate this summer in the Chicago area? trying to find a place to live for my internship.

San Francisco Bay Area to new Haven

NYC-based alum here. Your best bet would be to fly to one of the major NYC airports (JFK, LGA, EWR) and take a Metro-North train from Grand Central or Harlem to New Haven's Union Station. You would need to use other local transit to get into Manhattan (NJ Transit, NYC bus/subway) but once you're at the train station, it's a hassle-free trip into New Haven. You can walk to campus or grab a taxi -- I walked from the station to Ezra Stiles, and I think it was around 15-20 minutes.

JetBlue is supposed to have BDL-SFO direct flights again later in the year.

My hometown is San Diego, flew into Hartford or JFK during my time as a Yale grad student. DM me for details.

I'm a CA native and did get teased for my "thick Californian accent". :)

1. Fly to JFK

4. Take the 6 to Grand Central

I find that fares to JFK tend to be lower than LGA (and there isn’t an easy way to get to NH from Bradley AFAIK)

So my parents finally gave in and decided I should go to Yale. 

Issue is that they insisted I wear a tile tracker and leave my location on so they could see what I am doing.

Is there a way to get around this besides the constant stress of spoofing my location? How closed off is the campus, and are there any areas restricted to students only?

Most places on campus can only be accessed via an ID card

They don’t want me visiting the city, and might find me attending anywhere else besides classes (recreation centers) questionable. They are extremely traditional Muslims who think dating is a sin and that I shouldn’t hang out with dudes, wear t-shirts, shorts, or do anything too Americanized. That’s always been my life, so I don’t know what it’s like outside of those restrictions

Put your tracker on handsome Dan lmfao what the fuck is wrong with your parents

If removed, will no longer coordinate with my schedule - aka buildings I’m usually in, and coupled with their FaceTime calls they’ll make.. oh no. 

Yes I’m indeed Asian. I am also an ex-muslim in a traditional, super toxic Muslim family. 

Hypothetically, what would happen if you agreed provisionally, then, once you got to Yale, ignored their request? That’s one option. 

I wish. also scared bc they are planning on marrying me off in the coming years. They think dating is a sin and it makes me miserable that at Yale I won’t ever be my own person

Timeline to find housing? (Grad student)

Hi there! I'm an incoming grad student starting my PhD at Yale this fall (woohoo!!). I need to be moved in by August 1 as I have a course starting that day. What is the right timeline to be searching for off-campus housing? I'm on the facebook page but it is still mostly summer sublets and there isn't a whole lot on websites like apartments.com/zillow right now. Should I already be looking, or is it too early? Any recommendations on where I should be looking or general tips? Thanks! :)

Hey I just applied for housing with Elm Campus Partners as well. It’s unclear to me how their process works after you submit an application. Will they reach out to me as apartments become available?

Edit: There are some companies to avoid. I'm still new to the city so hopefully others would be more helpful but don't lease anything from Pike International and I think Mandy (something).

I'm a current high school student, and I would love to sit in on a Yale class via Zoom this summer.

Last I checked, auditing actually costed just as much as taking the class. ETA: and many professors still expect you to do the work and participate. You just don’t get a grade.

What is the maximum amount of extracurriculars you have seen a Yale student successfully be involved in?

Research, community service, debate, finance, and theatre/comedic writing? I think those are the top 5. I also really want to join Bookbinding, but that doesn't fit in any of those areas funnily enough.

Honestly, the hottest comedy release on campus is probably the yaleactualweeklynews instagram page, they're much funnier than the record, which very few people actually read. Don't join YUDI lol. YPU is probably in a worse state than when I was there not so long ago, the point of the YPU is to join and find a home in a political party, not to actually participate in the YPU.

What's wrong with YUDI?

oh it’s like a joke organization that no one takes seriously, the other org that actually invests with real money (i forgot the name) that’s competitive to get into is the one that you want. Since wall street people actually went to yale, they know yudi is a joke so it’s useless.

double majoring

I’m interested in double majoring in two very different subjects, studio art and international relations. Someone on here told me that the difficulty and value of a double major depends on my majors. Does a double major in these fields seem plausible, and if so, how difficult? I’m trying to decide between double majoring at Yale or doing the Brown RISD Dual Degree (five years), and I would like to know what to expect from double majoring at Yale.

Okay so the undergrad art major requires 14 course credits, global affairs\* requires 13 course credits (and an L5 language course). That's 27 course credits, and depending on what language you're going to do and how far along you already are with it, that could be 1-7 additional credits (not sure if you can place into L5s, but I assume it's possible). I doubt either would cover the science requirement (2 credits), looks like global covers QR reqs, I would assume you'd end up in WR credits with global at some point, humanities/art reqs would be covered, and global should also cover social science reqs. 

If you only take classes for the completion of these majors and 2 science credits (assuming you start as L1 for your language for global), you'll hit 36 credits (the required amount to graduate). So it seems doable, especially if you have a good grasp on a non-English language already (that would give you some wiggle room to just take classes you find interesting).

\*I think global affairs is the Yale equivalent of international relations, not 100% sure, international relations isn't in the Yale list of majors and I assume global is the closest thing?

Hey, does anyone know if u have to report whether of not u received the ib diploma to Yale? Like I have all A’s in my courses and I’m going to sit for the tests but I’m really worried abt the outcome lol

junior at yale here. to this day i’ve never even checked my official IB scores. i just submitted my predicted scores on my yale app and never thought about it again.

How feasible is it to complete a ba in Comp Sci as well as the bs/ma program in statistics at Yale?

Maybe possible? You would have almost zero choice over schedule. It would be a total of 32 courses. You can double count 2, meaning you would only have to take 30. That leaves 6-10 open spots for distributional requirements. Assuming you can fill the Quant. Reasoning and Social Studies via your degrees (ex. Econometrics for S&DS), you have 2 writing courses, 2 humanities, and 2 sciences. Finally, you may have to take up to 3 language credits. This puts you at a total of 39 credits, 3 over the needed to graduate, and 1 under the amount you would have if you took the max of 5 courses per semester ( you can override 5, but only with approval).

P.S. It has to be done in 4 for the BS/MA

Does anyone know what the Admission Office’s practice is? This is just out of curiosity.

Yale merch on the Yale campus??

ive heard some people refer to it as snobby?? like trying to chase prestige/"clout" when everyone else also has claim to it and it being a bit redudant since wearing college merch is meant to signifiy you go there while your physically a student on the campus. ive just heard some stuff like that on why it might be bad taste bc of that and i just didnt wanna give off the wrong vibe yknow??

Do not worry about this. I (and everyone else I know) wears Yale stuff way more on campus than off, tbh

ah okay i see!! if its free merch i see why + everyone seems v prideful in their college and insists that their's the best yknow?? i cant wait until i get my college placement and get to join in on the fun 🥳

The only residential college merch I see commonly is Branford and Trumbull hats lol, maybe sometimes those sillimander t-shirts or the grey and red TD merch but that's about it

Incoming freshman too. Just curious here, but why would it be pretentious or bad taste? I was thinking of buying some merch and probably using it too

I know someone who wore a UNC jacket to a Duke information session. He got in, and wore it again on campus a few days ago. No word on how that went.

So the moral of this story is to wear Harvard swag.

In my experience, about a third of campus is wear Yale gear at any point in time, within growing substantially during hoodie season.
