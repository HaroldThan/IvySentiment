I swear I’ve left several voice mails and emails with not a single response, is there any better way to actually get in touch with them or should I just give up and look for apartments elsewhere?

Yes, if the screening form states you need a TB test it has to be done in the US.

\[Academic\] How does one's attachment to parents during childhood influence college student substance use behaviors?

Hello everyone :) I am a researcher at Carlow University working on their master's thesis. This survey is specifically looking at the relationship between substance use and parental attachment. It should only take about 5 minutes to complete. If you could help me out, it would be much appreciated :)

Sorry for the confusion here, but I hope that explanation makes sense. If you have any other questions, feel free to message me :)

Cafeteria enthusiast here. I have visited over 100 cafeterias over the past six years in 28 states and two countries. I even ate in a small “field cafeteria” in the Arizona desert with scorpions running around and did my Brown admission video on cafeteria food if you wanna know how serious I am about this.

Additionally, the hours of operation and wait times at Brown’s dining halls are completely unacceptable. MSU’s main dining halls were open from 6-10, whereas the Ratty closes at 7:30. I also couldn’t remember a time where I had to wait more than 5 minutes for food at MSU’s main halls “Case,” “Akers,” or “SnyPhi.”

I honestly feel most universities provide pretty damn good food for a fraction of the cost. Idk where Brown’s meal plan money is going because the food, though not terrible, isn’t the best

Really? I generally feel like quite a fed of the universities I’ve visited have really middling food. The amount of cardboard pizza and wilted salad I’ve had is a number I never want to admit to, lol

Transfer Credits for Summer Courses

Incoming transfer student here. I was thinking of taking some courses during the summer at either the school I am leaving or at another university. Does anyone know if these will be accepted as transfer credits, or will they not be accepted? Don't want to waste a couple thousand if they aren't going to be credited.

I think because you haven't matriculated yet, you'd only have to follow any guidelines here, since the information I'm finding on the Registrar website is for currently enrolled students studying away from Brown: [https://admission.brown.edu/transfer/transfer-credit](https://admission.brown.edu/transfer/transfer-credit) However, I'd reach out to the Admissions Office with any questions -- keep in mind that you have to be at Brown for at least 4 semesters as a transfer.

If it’s at your current university and is a “higher level” course of one you took during the spring or fall, there’s a loophole if ur just trying to get an equivalency granted (without trying to advance your standing). If u took calc 1, for example, in the spring then calc 2 during the summer, u would probably only be granted credit in the system for the spring course. However, when submitting an equivalency request on ASK, u can submit it for calc 2, as it just shows up as “Unassigned Math Credit” on banner/ask.

I’d recommend u not take summer courses unless ur studying engineering or something else where u need to get ahead as possible

Should I apply to transfer?

Apply don’t regret

&#x200B;

I'm a rising senior in high school looking to apply to Brown. I know the video portfolio can be a significant part of the application, but the truth is, I don't keep a lot of videos of myself (out of insecurity).

I'm afraid of coming off as lame. I'm not extroverted; I don't have too many friends, and I spend my time hiding out in my room, mostly. No parties or crazy football games, cute prom pictures or instagram-worthy videos.

I made my video 4 hrs before it was due and just talked about some of my interests and did a small show and tell related to the interests I talked about

does first year housing applications open later in the month?

I’m an incoming freshman absolutely scared to miss deadlines about housing… In addition to the title, my other question is if singles are first come first serve? 

I think singles only go to students with accommodations or they’re randomly assigned like all other rooms and they’re super rare. There’s a lot more triples which I was unaware of as a freshman so be prepared for at least one roommate. Our housing questionnaire was available pretty late and we didn’t get our assignments til maybe a week or two before move in

I'm interested in an APMA concentration but I'm stuck choosing between MATH  0520 or 0540. For context, I have taken a proof based linear algebra course before, but I don't feel like I grasped the material that well. From the most recent surveys on The Critical Review, it seems like 0540 has better teachers, but I'm also not sure how reliable this is because do different professors teach it each year? I'm leaning toward 0540 because I have some background with it, but I'm worried that if I take 0540 I won't get much practice with application and solving problems. 

&#x200B;

Unless you want to major in pure math, do 520. Maybe it was just bad my year but I didn't know anyone in 540 who didn't wish they'd taken 520.

I took 540 and it was the best decision, made me go from apma cs to pure math cs.  520 is a lot of computation.  You can get that experience anywhere from any free online resources— just practice practice practice.  What you cant get anywhere is access to a construction of linear algebra from the ground up.  One of the professors in the rotation wrote “Linear Algebra Done Wrong” which is one of the destination textbooks for these kinds of courses.

art classes at brown

i’m an incoming freshman at brown and i was just curious if it’s possible/ how difficult it is to take art classes at brown as a non-concentrator. i took ap art in high school and would definitely be sad to not take an art class again in college, but from my brief research it seems difficult to get into the VISA department’s classes and even harder to take a class at RISD. any advice/ experiences?

Does Brown rescind acceptance for academic reasons? Does anyone know anyone who has gotten rescinded?

I was accepted ED to Brown and am just a bit nervous because it looks like I will finish 2nd semester with 2 Bs, and some of my grades have dropped. Any help is really appreciated thank you so much :)

concentration distribution at brown?

hi does anyone have a chart with the percent of the class in each concentration

:( i guess they discontinued powerlifting.

:( i guess they discontinued powerlifting.

Do anyone know how many get off the transfer waitlist at brown.? When do they get back?  

So I’m an (international) incoming freshman and was just going through the classes - do y’all think I should take 5 classes or stick to 4? Was choosing between: 

2. Math 90/100 (not sure what to take)

Do y’all think this is too much work or is it manageable? Was also wondering if taking the entrepreneurship course in my 1st semester wasn’t worth it as I’ll have a long time before I would possibly declare it as a certificate and idk I might even double concentrate! Any advice would be helpful!

Some people take 5 courses and are okay. I would highly recommend against doing so as a first semester freshman. I know far too many freshmen who have taken on too much work in their first semester and regretted it. Take 4 first, see how you do, then if you have enough free time your first semester, do 5 in the spring.

Econ 110 AKA “Principles” - Hard to ace/hard to fail (as with almost all intro courses at Brown)

Idk about IAPA sorry :(

Note that u can always take a course and drop it later

Did consider that, but really don’t want to!! I’m as it is not going to get credit for it, as I self studied the AP and have it externally, ig I might as well do it properly with a professor!

You place out of Econ 110 with those AP scores if that helps with your decision.

Help with First Semester Course Selection

1) When exactly should I register for courses? Do I just have to add courses to my cart and register or do I need to get my courses approved by an advisor as well?  

2) How exactly do you "shop" classes?  

3) I am not sure which CS intro course to take... Should I try out two intro CS courses or will the extra intro course be excessive?  

4) If any of you have experience with Astronomy courses, how intense is the courseload for introductory courses?  

5) Is there a resource that can help me decide what math class might be best for me? I am familiar with the basics of calculus but I'm not sure how well my high-school education will translate to college.  

Just as a follow up to 1) do I need to initiate something on my part? Is there a chance that a class that I might want to take will fill out if I'm late to register for it? Again thanks a bunch for this!

1) Yes — and that all takes place closer to when school starts

2) Add classes to your cart and just show up during the scheduled time. Do the homework assignments for all the classes you’re somewhat serious about

4) idk

5) There’s a placement test. Honestly, college math classes do teach a lot more than calc ab/bc, but it shouldn’t really matter. If you got like a 4 on the ap exams, you know enough of the most important shit to move forward and learn the stuff you missed later.

I'm afraid I don't have a lot of coding experience. Will the placement exam have programming related questions exclusively or can I expect some maths too?

last year the placement had 4 parts spread out over two-ish months. the questions are all programming based but in a functional language that nobody has coded in before so you’ll be more or less on the same level

3. If you’d like to take CS at a faster pace / if you have experience / etc, then check out [cs19](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/)! they have a summer placement (not open yet) that you need to pass to be admitted into the class. taking cs19 allows you to skip a semester of intro cs, but beware it’s a difficult course with a high time commitment. good luck :)

Any tips on applying?

Did anyone get admitted w/o taking 3 years of a language?

Saw on Brown’s page that they require 3 years of foreign language, saw elsewhere it was just recommended

Daughter did 2 years in high school, but reached year 3 of the language (year 1 was in 8th grade). But as a junior she moved to a program that didn’t have year 4 of that language. She noted that in the additional information section of the Common App.

i did only 2 years and i got in

I only did 2 years

They really dragged all of us out of bed early just to have us stand in line for an hour and counting... classic Brown, wouldn't wanna end my 4 years any other way :D :D :D

Possible Transfer: Leave Cornell or Transfer to Brown (thoughts/opinions appreciated)

i am a prospective transfer to brown from cornell and am very torn about my decision (due the 31st). i just finished my freshman year at cornell and am undecided in the school of arts and sciences but lean towards humanities/social sciences/policy.

however, i don’t know if a lot of the broader, environmental factors at cornell would bother me as much if i felt like i had a close friend group which may just come with time and sticking it out. that aspect doesn’t really seem like it would be helped by transferring. if anything, that would put me at a “disadvantage” socially.

Taking language classes.

Hey! I’m a grad student who’s interested in taking German at Brown. However, I’m more interested in passively taking it (or auditing max) instead. 

Does anyone know if we can just sit in the class without enrolling?

Email the teacher/department. As an undergrad I know it's definitely possible (called vagabonding, I did it my first year) and I've had some grad students in my classes, so I don't see why it wouldn't be. Depending on the language class it'll probably be too small for you to slip under the radar, but unless there's a rule against it I bet they'll let you

At Brown, we have the Rat E, but no Rat A, B, C, or D.

Just go! Nothing happens the first week of classes

It’s literally shopping period, unless that changed since I graduated 10 years ago. Have fun! Life’s too short. I miss doing stuff like this… Now I have a job 😭

its a weekend so hopefully i wont have any : )

I’m so jealous!!! I say absolutely go. The first week is a joke anyway

Prospective Transfer: Struggling between staying or going

(not sure if this will get taken down because it’s not relevant or too long)

i’m currently a freshman at UCSD double majoring in  cognitive science design and computer art, and was fortunate enough to have been accepted to Brown. 

some more background academically: i want to eventually go into the tech field as a UX/UI designer, and think UCSD could equip me with the technical skills to achieve that. but, my main academic reason for transferring was that i also wanted to pursue an independent branch of tech, which is more ethical design and tech, which i feel like some of the theory heavy courses of Brown could benefit me with.

I think you should stay at UCSD. You are almost done with your double major degree. You can still pursue further education afterwards. If you go to Brown then the time spent at UCSD will be wasted.

Hi! Im a rising freshman here! When do we usually have to choose our classes for the first semester?

German classes at Brown

Any advice on beginner German Classes at Brown? Which profs are recommended? Workload?

I never took, but I hear great things about it since I considered taking German 110. Most language classes are easy with a lot of work and strict class times.

If u take the intensive version, it would eat ur life in terms of time but class sizes are small

Have all of the upcoming freshmen uploaded Bank Statement and received I20?

I have submitted my I-20 request form.

Did anyone get an invite for phi beta kappa? Is it worth it to join?

Maybe contact the chaplain’s office?

Hi, I’m looking for someone to stay at my place for the summer (June-August)! Let me know if you’re interested in subletting and I’ll send you more information with details about the place :)

How good or bad is CS173?

CS173 is offered in the Fall only. I want to know about the experiences of students who have taken it in the past?

I took it last Fall and would highly recommend for CS concentrators. It doesn't teach a new skill that you could list on paper in my opinion (unless you're going into the field of PL), by this I mean that unlike classes such as UI/UX or CS33, you can't summarize in 1 word what you learned ("I learned frontend" / "I learned C/C++ and Systems") -- However, what it does give you is a much deeper understanding of why things work the way they do, which can really help with making your code neater, less error-prone, and helps in understanding the weird edge-cases that might come up in programming.

Overall, personally CS173 was a like an overall booster to my programming style and robustness, but didn't teach me any *new* skills for fields outside PL.

I don't think I gained a lot in terms of tangible skills, honestly. The class is defined by Shriram's personal focus on pedagogy, so you're using a very isolated, sandbox-y toolbox. Still, I think the course provides a solid foundation to enable you to better understand the inner workings of more typical languages if/when you ever decide to do that.  

Can I apply for the plme as an international student needing a full ride or just Brown pre-med?? (Class of '27)

Admissions letter and stuff?

I am filling in my OISSS profile and it ask me to submit an admissions letter and financial aid award letter. How may I obtain them in pdf?

What libraries offer mainstream books like YA Romance?

I’m not a student but I might be coming to Brown to work as an RA for the summer precollege program and I need some help on navigating resources on campus.

this morning i looked up "kitchen confidential" by anthony bourdain, which is something most libraries would have multiple copies of. brown only has one copy, and it's missing.

Can I get in trouble for a 1 on the AP French Exam?

Edit: Just realized Brown has on their website that they require at least 3 years and recommend 4 years of foreign language in high school. Would the 1 / no score make them think I didn't satisfy the requirement?

It doesn't matter at all. Nobody is going to gaf about your AP scores. I just wrote random shit on AP stat to avoid the "-"/ whatever "no submission" marker they use since it wasn't worth anything, and, of course, it was never mentioned. Come to think of it... I didn't even take 3 years of foreign language in HS (granted, I transferred to a HS in a county that didn't offer anything, so I had to go through the state's online school system GAVS, which itself only offered I and II)

Thank you! I am just worried because Brown does have a foreign language requirement for high school applicants, so I was afraid it was inconsistent with my grade. I still have a 97 in that class so that's not a problem

Brown has a foreign language requirement?

"and Foreign Language - at least 3 years, preferably 4 years of a single language."

TL;DR: No, as long as you didn’t also fail the class for some reason

How do you even get a 2 lmao did you only write your name?

lmao so to be clear I didn't take the class. I told myself I'd self-study and take the exam. Guess how much self-studying I did in senior spring

Lmao I had massive senioritis and got a 2 on AP CS A after saying I was gonna concentrate in CS in my app. As you can see they did not care :)

>Can I get in trouble for a 1 on the AP French Exam?

No

Why even take the exam? You’re not gonna get credit at Brown for it even if you got a 5 right? If you’re getting a normal grade for the class I feel like the AP exam is meaningless

Lol this sounds harsh but nobody cares enough about you to 1. check your individual AP scores, 2. re-consider, re-weigh, and re-decide admissions decision, 3. notify you of a rescindscion, all over one AP score

Best/worst language classes?

I'm an incoming '26 and I LOVE  languages. I intend to learn two new ones by the time I graduate, and I'd like  to start my freshman year by diving into one, but I can't decide between Japanese, Italian, Korean and Mandarin - they're all so appealing. Obviously the actual language I choose depends on a variety of things, but I was wondering if anyone could share some info on which language teachers/classes at brown are the most loved or hated by students, or any other info that could help me decide. Thanks!! :)

I took 7 Mandarin classes at Brown and the Chinese professors are some of the best I ever had

I'm really trying to get off the waitlist. are there any small programs I may not find in my research that I could mention (i'm interested in international politics) or programs that Brown is specifically proud of that they'd like to hear I like?

I've just accepted I'm not getting off the transfer waitlist lol

Does Brown University have shared bathrooms for girls & boys?

Some first-year dorms have single-occupant bathrooms that are shared among four people instead of larger ones for the whole hall; those are gender-neutral

Many dorms have gender neutral bathrooms. However, each building also has the “traditional” male/female bathrooms to use as well

I think they mean dorm bathrooms

Does brown university have separate bathrooms for graduate students

My freshman year in Keeney we had a unit (floor) vote to turn all bathrooms gender neutral. People still kinda remembered which were originally male and female and just stuck to that all year lmao

Cooking on Campus?

hello everyone!! I have a general question, as a first gen BIPOC student going to brown will put me in a place where i’d be eating foods that i’m not used to in the lunch halls. however is there a way to cook your own foods somewhere on campus?

There are dorm kitchens in which you can cook your own food. They vary in quality based on the dorm itself. Grocery stores are somewhat far from campus, and since first years have to pay for the largest meal plan most don’t cook regularly or at all. It’s difficult to justify cooking when you’d be wasting a meal you’ve paid for.

Different dorm options and meal plan requirements/options mean that upperclassmen cook more often than first years.

hey everyone, if I took multivariable calculus and linear algebra at my high school, is there a way for me to place out of those at Brown?   

would it be a test or just up to advisor discretion to let me out? is there anyone I can email for a chat/a  test?  

Sounds good - I don't really want actual credit, but I really don't feel like going through the trouble of the two courses again especially after the extra rigor my high school put into the courses. Would I have to email each of my profs for an override request or just my department chair? When should I do this? (On a side note, when do advisors reach out to prefrosh?) Planning on double concentrating in CS and APMA-Economics!

If you find this to be too annoying you can set up a meeting with the relevant department academic dean to try and get placement credits so you're counted internally has having satisfied the prerequisites. Though, I've heard it's an equally annoying process and unlikely if you haven't taken the classes with a university rather than a high school. 

I can confirm that the math department doesn't offer a placement test in either course for credit. If either course was a dual-enrollment course (taken at a college while in high school), you could contact Dean Bhattacharyya and apply for placement credit, which would usually only be given if it's ruled a necessity to graduate. But if the courses were not taken at a college, you'd need to either take them again here (which is not ideal unless you think you have something left to learn in the subject) or approach the appropriate people (professors of courses where you need an override because of the prerequisite, or concentration advisors if the course is required for a degree) and ask for exceptions.

Okay, how am I supposed to know that though? I'm not gonna stand outside in the cold waiting for it to get there...

there was one time i was getting on the shuttle with a friend (who had called) and the driver was asking how many people and where we were going. given that i was the one entering the vehicle first & my friend was behind me outside the shuttle, i answered for him. driver completely ignores me and keeps asking despite me answering again. it isn’t until my friend speaks up from outside that we get on with the drive. it felt terrible & cried a bit idk i felt like shit just being completely ignored like that for no reason. mind u that was the only bad experience i had with on-call, usually it’s all good :)

Looking for any leads to find housing near Pawtucket

Hello people I am a graduate student who is planning to look for accommodation near Pawtucket for my co-op with Hasbro. If anyone has any leads on how to find an apartment message me.

What am I supposed to be doing right now?

I was admitted Brown ED and I haven’t received anything about paying a deposit, when I’m moving in, housing application and information, etc. I have my financial aid award letter and that’s about it. Should I be concerned or be doing something right now?

Yep, that should be it. If it’s bothering you, just send a quick email to the admissions office and double check

Incoming trans/nonbinary first-year issues

**Housing**

I don't understand why Brown still assigns first-year housing based on *legal sex*, and why even for gender-inclusive housing, you still can't choose the gender of your roommate. Many other colleges allow a student to choose the gender of their roommate. 

**Gender marker on the ID card**

If I [understood correctly](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/lgbtq/transbrown/name-id-email-changes-updates), the only options are male and female, and you can only change it after a legal gender marker change. What???

Admissions used my correct name for the acceptance letter and the portal so I was thrilled. But then I got my [brown.edu](https://brown.edu) email with my deadname on it... Great. As a first-year student, I won't be able to change it until some time in June. Even then, without going through the lengthy process to change my ID legally, my deadname can still pop up in different places later on.   

I work at the IT Service Center on campus. Brown is very serious about such issues, and we have several systems in place to deal with this.

I just looked at my ID in case I had missed the “gender marker”. I can’t find anything whatsoever indicating a gender. I’m pretty sure that is an internal system identifier.

I think you may have access to banner a bit earlier to change the internal name / email but I’m not sure. All I can say is that you won’t need to communicate with your current email for a while. Additionally, I think once you’ve changed your name and email in Banner no one should see your deadname in any academic interactions. I imagine it could show up in medical forms or other administrative forms.

Hi! I’m actually a staff member at the Brown LGBTQ center. I’m so sorry you have to deal with this -it’s something that we have been trying to work in with the university but they’re being really annoying about it. I highly suggest talking to Kelly (the director of the LGBTQ center) to help sort it out, regardless of if you are a current student. As a previous comment noted -there is a system to change pronouns/names independently but it is a little obtuse. I highly suggest you reach out to the LGBTQ Center! You can also dm for more info or if you would like me to connect you!

Doing research and applying to be a residential assistant a good idea?

That RA position is pretty consuming. I think it’s full time, and they ask you if you have other job commitments when you apply. I wouldn’t count on it working out

Visiting Student Program

I was just admitted to the Visiting Student Program at Brown for summer session and have no idea what to expect haha. Like what's the vibe of the summer term, how intense is the course load, is the campus still pretty active in the summer, etc.

Above all, make sure to prioritize your mental health. It doesn't matter if you get decent grades one semester if you're burnt out for the next four. If things get too tough don't be hesitant to reach out to professors to have a class marked incomplete so you can finish it off later. You can also drop a class at any time before final exams and it won't show up on your transcript.

What actually gets you rescinded from Brown?

Im just nervous (I’m an intl that has IB exams next week 😅).

No 😇

Used some person's wrong pronouns?

Have you committed any crimes since your admission?

Im exactly In the same situation man! Only I never sent predicted scores (my school didn’t have them ready). And yea I’m aiming at a 35+ and hopefully that’ll be fine!

Hi, I am also admitted and taking my IB exams, so I am glad you asked this. From what I have heard based on past years a general think is like try not to drop /significantly/ which to our school is more than 5 points. I had some friends who have gone to their US unis with 41/42 predicted and ended up with 37/42 on the exams and are fine. I think for me at least I will try to maintain but not drop more than 4 points in my subjects. Idk I am just doing my best i guess idk what else I can do hehe.

Bar literal crimes or the university finding out you lied on your application, it is ridiculously hard to to rescinded

No 😇

Question about financial aid at Brown

Thanks in advance! :)

Sophomore here. In my experience, it really doesn't change unless you have a pretty significant change in income or assets. So if you're paying nothing the first year, you'll continue that for your 4 years at Brown

I need help I literally can't decide (Brown Vs Carnegie Mellon CS)

I want to go into CS and I'm trying to decide between Brown and Carnegie Mellon SCS. I know CMU is #1 in CS, and their school is huge and really cool, but it kinda intimidates me and the stress culture there is pretty strong from what I saw visiting. However, IDK how much of that is surface-level stereotyping. 

I have 2 days so any advice here would mean the world to me thank you so much :)

not if you take the 19 intro sequence, otherwise the intro courses get up to 300 students

After the intro courses, however, you can expect each class to be no more than 40 students on average. All of my CS courses in my final years were <20 students.

Message me in three years and I’ll get you an internship

&#x200B;

I'm also not sure how much of Brown's culture translates into the CS department to be honest. The program is in such high demand that the whole thing is pretty rigidly structured and impersonal, at least at the intro level. CS office hours you have to fill out a form with your exact issue and then wait in a line for a few hours to get your timed 15 minutes with a TA, whereas pretty much any other major I'm aware of you can just go knock on your professor's door and talk about whatever

Brown.  Period.

Definitely CMU, as a Brown CS student. The vast majority of CS classes here are not very collaborative here and is mainly solo work, except maybe if the class has a final project. If you only plan on focusing on CS it won't be easier than CMU in terms of workload because most professors are not very good at lecturing and the assignments can be very vague/confusing. There's also a stress culture here among CS majors but it probably isn't as bad as at CMU.

I plan on majoring in political science or public policy and hopefully completing health care policy research as an undergraduate student. I currently plan on entering law school after undergrad.

Leaning towards Duke (\~15k/yr):

Brown (\~13k/yr):

* It has the weakest name of the 3?

* Strong drug presence worries me

UPenn CAS (\~12k/yr):

Other schools I was previously considering: Georgetown SFS (\~25k/yr), JHU (\~7k/yr), Rice (\~9k/yr), Williams (\~5k/yr)

With the open curriculum, you can for sure explore poli sci/ IAPA (basically ir)/ public policy which are all offered as separate majors. Duke might be better for other streams but in your case, Brown hands down.

Almost all of Penn's graduate programs in everything besides Wharton rank in the top 10 or 5 or even 3 without fail, including its law school; how in the world is that not world class, especially in comparison to institutions like Brown or Duke that can't say the same?

How about [Penn's online-only CS masters](https://platform.onlinelearning.upenn.edu/offering/master-of-computer-and-information-technology-a0Q2E00000Jnj9CUAR) that cannot take in-person classes nor participate in on-campus recruiting?

Fels is also practically irrelevant on campus and much of the public policy and polisci activity happening on campus happens in either Wharton or the Perry World House, and not to mention that non-Wharton students still have access to Wharton classes and faculty members along with events and fellowships at the Perry Word House

There's also public health figures both within Penn Medicine as well as Wharton that you can have access to as a Penn student

You’re saying It’s immature to want to avoid drugs? 😂

I don't think it's immature and think u/SpursSpice is being harsh. I too would be uncomfortable if drugs were an integral part of Brown's social scene. However, u/Fall_2022 is right in that it's heavily exaggerated.

Brown Life Hacks?

Thank uuuuuuu 🙏🙏

Thank uuuuuuu 🙏🙏

Thank uuuuuuu 🙏🙏

Anyone selling tickets to spring weekend tomorrow?

Will pay top dollar for ticket and ID to get my girlfriend and one friend into the concert. Will take a male or a female ticket and workout the rest.

Finance internships?

What experience have students had with finance summer internships during their time at Brown? As underclassmen and upper classmen?

If you want to financially survive…you are going to likely need to live in the city (away from east side providence). 

let’s discuss the anti ivy league to brown student pipeline

For undergrad I got rejected from all the Ivys I applied to, and studying in Boston I used to shit on and meme on Harvard all the time, and now here I am going to Brown for a Master's 😅

happened to me 😳 I’ve been telling everyone for the past four years that I wasn’t even considering the ivies and now I’m going to Brown in the fall lol

This is late but I EDed to a T3 Liberal Arts college thinking that "I was *too* good for the pretentiousness of the Ivies* lol but here I am 🤡

I don't know anything about coding but I want to learn a bit with a few introductory classes (not a CS major), which one should I take first? I heard I can take CS 111 then 112, is that a good idea?

Hello!! I also had this question at one point, so I'll throw you a bone.

First off, if you're an incoming first-year, welcome to Brown! :)

I took CS11 with Kathi as a "non-major." Prior to the course, my only experience with coding was an introductory MATLAB course equivalent of APMA 0160, and overall I thought the course was *okay* relative to other courses I've taken during my two years of college.

Like those in CS17, you'll learn the basics of trees, recursion, data types, etc., but not in the depth of the said course. Most of CS11 was taught using a functional programming language called Pyret, which is used strictly in educational settings. I personally found the language very fun but also a pain in the ass considering my MATLAB background. You'll also spend the last week or two doing the same thing you learned in Pyret but in Python (to demonstrate how concepts remain the same across languages).

The course is structured most similarly to CS17 with homework every week and a few exams but with a lot less work. There are only two (kinda 3?) projects that demanded only about half the work my CS17 and CS15 friends had to go through.

How is the Pre-Med experience at Brown (without PLME)

I was recently accepted to Brown RD for the class of 2026 as an intended chemistry major on the pre-med track and I'm having a really hard time deciding if Brown is the place for me. I know Brown is great for pre-med with the PLME program, but I didn't apply for that so I'm wondering how is pre-med at Brown for those who are not in the 8-year program? How competitive is pre-med at Brown and how easy is it to do research? How are the pre-professional counselors? For those who already applied to med school, do you think that the relaxed environment at Brown helped or hurt your application? Any insight will be greatly appreciated! The commitment deadline is in a week and I still have no clue where I should go :(

I’ve found premed to be not too difficult - the orgo sequence and biochem are obviously hard but that’s any school. I’ve found premed advising to be not great but fine - research kinda hard to get but if u email enough people you’ll find something. Not too competitive everyone helps each other out bc curves (grade cutoffs at brown) are usually determined before the semester. Generally people get good acceptances from brown but pretty much everyone takes a gap year after senior year

Thank you for any help :)

I’m planning on concentrating in cs! How good is browns cs program? (Median salary after grad, professors, classes, difficulty, etc.)

^ good starting places

Has anyone here transferred from UCLA to Brown?

Just did this cycle… starting at brown in the fall. Feel free to pm anytime, but obvi won’t have any brown-specific info yet since I haven’t attended any classes. Go bruins :)
